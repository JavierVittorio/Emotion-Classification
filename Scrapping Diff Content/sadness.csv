She was sad because of him
that's how i feel with my family which is falling apart
🥲🥲🥲
"Context is everything, I remember this episode. Started off normal, Marge loved Bart as her “special little man” then she caught him shoplifting and treated him more like a grown up. As the episode went on he thought she would forgive him and welcome him back like nothing happened. 

It wasn’t until the end of the episode that he tried to give her a gift for Christmas, that she thought he stole. After realizing it was an honest heartfelt gift and apology for what he did, she welcomed him back. 

Lot of comments see the short video not knowing Bart’s sadness came from his own actions"
This is why you have to put in people in the snowman family 😞 so sad for them 😭😭😭
Nah not the bart simpsons esits
I am crying because just because they say something doesn’t mean they mean it if they to old they will still want to be in…..

My mom never loved me
This reminds me about something hopping my best friend dosen't for get about me...
Notice how he’s not even included in the snowman family🥺
Families never wait for a child😢😭😭😭😭
I would have destroyed the snow family because of how betrayed I felt and I wouldn’t care if that made everyone else feel sad
"Can someone please please, please for the love of God tell me what the background song is I’ve literally been looking for it for hours because it was stuck in my head and then I found this video which had the song in but now I still can’t find the song even after I found the video with the song in it"
I want mommy And daddy😢
Why is this do true i always get compared to my friend Lena from school who is always better then me in everything.......😢
so*
I wish i could make a snow family

Yo that's mean he is not even in there the snowman family
"swearing isn't cool but my father would have begged for me to kill him after seeing this, but I'd kill him either way"
the stretchy guy i ripped inhalf wasnt as fucking weird as this
Think when a parent says to to a child that they indirectly don't need him.
Knowing that the mom is happy with out him broke my heart bec that literally my relationship with my mom 😢💔
this is sooo me
It’s a cartoon🥀🥀🥀🥀
My family is kinda more nicer but its the same..
My mom lied of taking me to the museum and I want revenge…
this made me cry
Now that’s just messed up
My dad doesn't care.....he does this with my other siblings I have been living with my mom....I found out I wasn't planned to be born....
That's my family nobody cares about me 🥲❤️‍🩹 I think my mom is happy but she's not really
I know bart simpson naughty but he doesn't deserve no love what i'm saying this i'm crying right now
If the parents said bart was to old for it then why are they doing it shouldn’t they be to old too?
Ts so sad..💔 my dih is splurting out tears uncontrollably..
The reality of my family
There’s some snow left under the car 💔
Song?
"Kill them, Bart"

"In the event that all these bets are valid, the one who would win the money, if he wanted me, he would want to give the money to my x before him and to his x before m. Since this is a bet, it is assumed to be 'love' and 'loss'. Our real x's, I mean not the supposed ones."
If my pants turn brown red😈
Thats how i feel with my family
...why him im cry
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"For the ppl who somehow think this is FUNNY BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH UNRELATED COMMENTS.

Bart is sad because there's a episode where we basically see all of there,ets clal them imperfections or fears, whatever you clal it. And basically Bart has a fear of being hated, as when all of everyone's fears go away we see bats fear and when it goes away it says ""they're only happy when I'm not there"" so basically Bart is afraid of being hated or he relies on other people to know what he's truly worth or if he's good enough which is why he sad here as well"

I just realized they have three kids and I don’t. I forgot what the boy is named but he’s the middle child I guess and the baby is the favorite because she gets so much attention.
As a child it was just not off but as a teenager we might finally see that the Simpsons were very toxic to him😢
Who’s cutting onions :(
Wen she say '' hey thats mom shes happy again '' my heart broke .
"i just realized that she is happy without bart and the ""thats mom! she's happy again!""almost made me cry"

It hurts when someone you care about is only happy when you leave there side

"Bro she’s like that because her son is a menace to society, many times he’s gotten involved with the mafia and shoplifted more times than I can count, this is not a kid at this point bro 🥀🥀🥀🥀"

"When I was in 2nd grade, this thing happened and I still remember it. It started as a happy Friday, where we wore our pe outfit, and my teacher swapped our seats. I was next to two of my friends, Ill call them Madison and Romeo for privacy reasons. I was closer to Romeo than I was with Madison, then I wrote something in my notebook, aka what the teacher was writing.
Then, Romeo pulled the garther of my pants, showing my underwear. Then he went to the back of my chair, I wasn't wearing any bra of something under my shirt, and he saw my chest. Then he called Madison and she also saw my chest. Then both of them went back back to their seats. Then out of nowhere, Romeo starts teasing me of why is my chest so big? And this all happened for about 5 minutes, and to the people who are about to comment, my teacher was still writing and she didn't saw what happened, I told my parents but they didn't do much of it, not even a complaint. And every day after that day, Romeo pulls up my skirt so he can see my underwear. I'm still traumatized because of this......."

"They didn't notice you were crying
They didn't notice you were sad
They didn’t notice you were tired
They didn’t notice you were alone
They didn’t notice how attentive you were
They didn’t notice how sweet you actually are...
They didn’t notice how you actually try to make others smile



They did notice you failing grades
They did notice your unattractive 
They did notice the mean side of you
They did notice all your mistakes 
They did notice all you flaws
They did notice that you weren’t good enough for them.



But you stayed strong
You kept going on
You never gave up on hope
You never let them take you down
And you know they wasn’t good enough for you
And that’s what make you stronger



You aren’t ugly 
You aren’t mean
You aren’t lazy
You aren’t a failure 
You aren’t a mistake 



You are beautiful 
You are worth it
You do deserve everything 
You are trying 
You are smart 
You do deserve to live"

I was dealing with a lot of criticism for my singing and my dreams to become an artist i draw do tattoos and sing and play guitar after I watched this i guess it is normal to get this type of stuff but the difference was that for me I called a kid who was friends with most of the cops in my city ugly he snaped and said he was gonna get his dad to turn me into a T.I . It led to slander and ah bunch of of nonsense and being vulnerable to their opinions  but Anyways I'm so happy I found this you put my mind and spirit on track again thankyou also your Charming humor is delighting lol.

Saddest songs more like song
Me to 😢
Wanna know a song that’s even more sad that I now always play in my room when I’m alone? Numbers by Temporex it’s makes me feel depressed all the time and reminds me how lonely I am and makes me think I’m foolish for pretending I have friends with fictional characters

2: My dad was tying my shoes and then i went to my sisters house but i sall my cousins ceying and me and my brother asked what happened but he said nothing.. ans i didnt know so i kept colering then i heard my dads sister crying really hard in the room but i didnt want to ask what happen so instead i just kept colering but when i went home i sall my mom on the couch doing nothing and i looked around for my dad but i didnt find him so i asked mom where he was but she stayed quiet then i just went to my room and fell asleep but the next day my whole entire family was on the coucked crying really hard then my mom admitted that my dad had a heart attack so hes not here with us anymore and i started crying my lungs out cas i remebered that he always sang a song to me when i was little kid and it was Sunshine"

"I've never met anyone that survived an attempt that weren't so happy that it failed a year or 2 later. I'm not saying that its not out there, but do your best to stick it out. The strength you get from it really llifts you up in a way that helps others. Few things feel better than being the answer someone else's needs because the experience you survived."
"I sit in my room and I came across this... 

I lost my childhood to abusive people who literally tortured me for existing, had no friends or GFs for the 12 years I was in school, I was shunned because I was quiet, I was made fun of for everything, I watched every mothers day go by wanting my mommy who didn't even want me... when becoming an adult I watched people follow their goals and dreams while I had no one to be there to make working hard worthwhile, I was cheated on by 3 of 6 of my exes and the other 3 Exes just left me because I was the burden and loved too much, I lost friends and I'm the only family member who has nothing going for himself... 

It hurts a lot. And not the kind of hurt that simply goes away but the kind of hurt where I wanna curl up in the fetal position hugging a pillow to death and letting lose with my tears and just silently crying... 

Watching people succeed in life and being scared of doing anything because I'm afraid of becoming heartless and a shitty person... I wake up daily and pretend that people messaged me... 

The worse thing is how I go into my imagination world where I am a hero and people rely on me to save them and I even listen to epic music just to spice up my imagination battles and I imagine meeting someone who likes me and having many friends and I imagine that I save the world...

Cringey, I know... My imagination is what made my childhood spend being locked away and sitting in pure darkness, bearable. I would often imagine scenarios that I have people who loved me and cared for me and I imagined I had friends and silently talked to myself and I often would pretend I was a superhero with powers who saved many people.


And then I woke up and realized that I was the same worthless kid who deserved to be beaten, spit on, thrown in freezing cold showers while getting beaten half to death with a belt while shivering... But I deserved it, right? I mean, I would pass notes to this girl in class and it was a love letter but my aunt found the notes I would never get to pass to my crush and when I did, she and everyone else used to laugh at me... I even tried giving her my gold bracelet that I treasured because I thought it was the right thing to do for someone you liked... so many days and nights I spent crying and begging anyone to save me like superman or some other fictional character but then I realized no one was going to save me...


I look back and realized that I don't deserve to enjoy life... Its almost like a sign telling me that my fate is to suffer. I met this girl before I left overseas and we hit it off and she shared with me that she also liked me but the last day I was still at home, she told someone else that I was stupid for believing she liked me and she was joking around pretending to hold my hand, kiss me, and cuddle with me and she told everyone else that she hated every single moment with me... I went overseas on a deployment having my heart broken when I found out I was not gonna have anyone waiting on me when I got back home... worse is how when I got back home, I hit it off with this girl who really liked me and I even stayed with her where we shared so many happy memories and then one day she just decided to break up and told me that she wanted to be independent... How does one wake up one day on your own bed after dreaming that your special someone was still with you,  cuddling you in bed, and sleeping beside you, and realizing that you were all alone? Imagine sleeping with someone, watching anime with her, holding each other, celebrating birthdays together, sharing tender moments and sleeping together and they just decide one day that they didn't feel like being with you because they wanted to be independent and then you find out that your partner cheated on you, lied to you with their long trips to their ""Parent's house"", and they just grow distant with you despite you trying to shower them with real love and reminding them everyday that they are beautiful, amazing, their smile is to die for, and you work hard caring for their animals and cleaning their apartment so they could come home to a nice clean apartment and they just sit you down in their back porch while having the guy she will be with after she gives you a long winded speech about how it was your fault that she grew distant and that she felt like she was a parent to a child and she didn't like you being ""overbearing"" despite her doing the same thing and told me I was too insecure despite her going for her long 3 day trips to friend's homes to party and get drunk and have seggs with other dudes while you worked long hours and deal with abusive managers just to go back to her place and spending long nights alone in bed knowing that she will eventually leave me... 

She broke my heart. Nah, she did far morw than break my heart... She ripped my heart out of my chest, she whispered lies to it talking about ""LoVe"" and ""A FuTuRe tOgEthEr"" and stomped on it a few times and in the end handed it back to me expecting me to not cry and beg for her to try and work with me so i wouldn't lose her because she was the one true girl I truly loved deeply and she did things for me that made me feel like I was married to her and she spoiled me and gave me sweet loving when I was depressed and then suddenly, she just... Leaves. She doesn't even tell me everything in person. She ripped into me and really treated me like shit because she didn't even want me to hurt really bad... 

After the dust settled, she told me that she felt guilty for hurting me and lying to me. She said she wanted me to hate her so much that I just quit acknowledging her and that I was too nice and loving and she even told me after her depressing speech to me that I can't cry or be sad or feel negatively afterwards... She made me feel worthless and helpless. After I got back home I cried so hard I spent months crying every other night and feeling lonely and even scared... She didn't even tell me what really happened and why she shoved me away... So even til this day I'm scared of giving someone my time and my heart just to rip my heart to shreds... I've felt this way for 5 years now... I still dream about her sometimes... and I always wake up crying. What's worse is that I still love her like an idiot... But I did promise her that she was my last gf. I didn't want anyone else. 

Every day, I hurt. It just fucking hurts alot. To realize that you have quite alot of love to give someone but you don't have that someone to share your love with... I just don't wanna die alone... It hurts... It hurts alot... 😔🥺😢😞"

"Here's how to make Boba

1 pack of Boba mix
1 cup of milk
1/4 cup of ice

First put the Boba mix into the mug. Then put it in the microwave for 1 minute. When it's done pour it into the cup with ice and pour 1 cup of milk. Mix as much as you want and enjoy :3"

"Thats nice butThe F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet developed by Lockheed Martin for the United States Air Force. Known for its unmatched air superiority, the F-22 combines stealth, speed, agility, and advanced avionics to dominate in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Its twin-engine design allows it to supercruise—fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners—while its radar-evading shape and coating make it nearly invisible to enemy detection systems. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and powerful weapons, the F-22 can detect and engage threats long before it's seen. Although production ended in 2011, the F-22 remains one of the most advanced and formidable fighters in the world."

And just on 25 July 2025 my aunt got a dog called minnie but when I first saw her I cried because I loved her and I was at my nannans and I saw my aunt come but she was in the car for a long time and I said at you coming and she said yes can you to inside and I did and I saw her through the window and was her and I was her holding something and I thought it was cocos collor,ball and his toys but she came in and I saw that on her shirt it said to my big sister coco in heaven is your little sister Minnie then I said what is it and my mum said was she a mother (well coco) and my aunt said she got a new dog and she brought Minnie in and I was so happy I got to hold her and jaws crying of happyness and I said I thought we would have no more dogs to look after but my mum said we were on babysitting duty and I went outside to play and I was paid down and picked her up again and I was there next to her for the most time she was there and I kept her safe and I could tell she loved me more and she had her first shot an the Docters so she was not jumpy and energetic and she was picking my ear and the cutest thing happened.... She barked like a Minecraft baby wolf and yesterday my cousin later told me that since she liked my ear and she loved my cousins cheek and then she had to go and my little brother missed her my cousin .... Stroked her and I kissed her and stroked and played when she went and I said I miss her already and then I did not know that that was the first time and last time I saw her well I went home went to bed and on Tuesday this week I went to a fair and I'm in the UK and I went to grange lane fair in Barnsley I think it was and the next day sadness struck in and my mum said that I was going to my nannans then and she told me about Minnie and I was guessing she couldn't go to nannans and I was right and here's what the measages said and here's a summary
Minnie is in the vets the is not well
Next.update Minnie is feeling better
.Minnie has gotten a realisation that one of her kidneys is smaller than the other and it can cause a shunt which can be fatal
(TO NOTE SHE DIDNT DiE FROM THAT)
(Then the news).since Minnie was not getting better and is costing £6-7k she had to be put down and she said that she is now gone over the rainbow bridge  with coco and I had to keep on reading until I realised. to me it said Minnie misses coco and wants to see her but it meant that she died and got put down😥😥😥😥😥😥😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😓😓😓😓😖😖😖😖😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫🙄😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌍🌈 at least I said goodbye😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😖😖😖😖😖😫😫😫😫😫😫😥😥😥😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫

I'm proud of you for trying
I'm proud of you for smiling
I'm proud of you for going outside
I'm proud of you for spreading kindness
I'm proud of you for being you
I'm proud of you no matter what
I know you're insecure but everyone is
I know you're not happy but your not alone
I know your getting builed but don't listen to them
I know your sad but try to be happy
I know your miserable but your still standing
I know your feel hated but you are loved
I know you feel sad but deep down you are proud"

The loss of my uncle leaves an irreplaceable void in my heart. His memory will forever resonate within me😢
Sad❤😢
I lost my grandma so I went to YouTube to respect my grandma 😞🤧
womp to the fucking womp
"​ @HelleNyaki You really said ‘womp womp’ like some cartoon villain, but the only thing dying in your hands is your dignity. That man opened up about losing someone, and your first instinct was to sound like a soundboard with no soul. You’re not tough, you’re just proof that evolution takes coffee breaks"
"​ @HelleNyaki You think you’re being edgy, but all you did was show everyone you’re the kind of person who’d laugh at a funeral just to feel relevant. He lost his uncle — a real person with a real life — and you turned it into your discount comedy bit. The only joke here is you, and nobody’s laughing"
"​ @HelleNyaki That’s why nobody tells you anything serious — because the last time they did, you probably hit ‘em with the same dry-ass ‘womp womp’ and proved you were raised by Wi-Fi and neglect."
❤❤❤😢😢😢
" @HelleNyaki  You typed ‘womp womp’ at someone grieving like it was a punchline, and that choice tells everyone more about you than it does about them. It says you’re either desperate for attention, proud of being cruel, or so emotionally stunted you think mocking loss makes you look important. Grow up. Apologize, delete the comment, or keep proving you have less empathy than a notification sound."
You make me cry😢
You are the one ☝️ I will not lie about that one
I was worried about mita will die i will be crying
SYBAU WOMP WOMP
Lol
"I'm so sorry bro that must be hard, I only lost my cat from liver failure and a tuimer in his brain. I'm sorry for your uncle, let us all have the angels guide you and everyone else. Amen"
"​ @HelleNyaki shut the fuck up bro you don't know what some challenges other people are going through. Treat people how you want to be treated, did your parents/gaurdians teach you any respectable manners bro, you know if you choose kindness now your life will be easer to go through. But I wish you the best, please don't be mean to others past or present or even future, amen bro let God and his angels guide you all."

What do you want to listen to sad songs🙋
"Actually in school I broke my friendship with my friend and I stood still and I put my head down with a sad face and I almost cried when mam said “go sit back”my friend came back and she said “side!” I sadly moved away and sit and my friend said “do you want to be my friend back?” she said and I agree because I was her bestie and she gave me one chance and I happily said bye but I thought for real she wouldn’t be my friend but I got lucky!

Edit:wow I got 700k likes

I had a dream where i saw my big sister kill her self cuz she told us to burry her alive and in the dream she said it will be ok we were all crying and she kept telling us not to expeccily mean and we kept crying then after i woke up in the middle of the night and now i keep thinking about it and im muslim and when i sercehed up what it ment it said i will face depprison and my life will be very hard and it makes sencd becuase im alreadly very deppresed my parent sdont know about not anyone knows and here is the qutoe of the day hurting pepole feeling is easy as throwing a rock in a lake but you dont know how deep that rock can go and one thing i forgot it also said i will face grief and lost
If you want deep look in the ocean it’s really deap
bro NF is so gooddd
"(I finished the lyrics with both songs together but I added my own lyrics at the end 🙃)


""I'm always tryna save time, talking to the voices in my head that make me thing twice-...…...…...…...-I try to tell myself- oh I need to step back, slow down, I'm getting to old for this. I'm gonna mess up, yeah... I don't deserve love because I'm just unwanted, a tool, a toy, just something to mess with, yeah... Don't worry about me because I'm not important at all"""
Been an NF fan for a minute he’s got some good shit
I know I’ll be made fun of but I just got friend zoned and this help so much I hope this helps other people as well

I lost the only one in my family and i hert him it was my cat and i wish i could see him i wish i could say sorry😔
I know NF is hella good but unfortunately he's a constant reminder of my ex. NF is her favourite artist so I can't really listen to any NF song without her voice ringing in my ears.
What app do you use to get the second song please say
Nice songs
"Did anyone notice that every song is exactly 5:20mins long 😅
By the way love the songs"

"I have a lot of NF songs in my playlist, one of the main artists I started listening to during one of my lowest points because there were songs of his I related to far too much"
Seriously? If you are going to use an NF song use How Could You Leave Us
"listen to happy by nf, those lyrics are super meaningful"
Bro can you please tell me the second song's name ❤❤
To the souls that leave us too soon
The first song I can relate to
I am really crying
"I love NF he is the best, another good song of his, personally my favourite is Happy"
Like this so that i get to know the pain
Anime Name in the beginning

"was 2, and my sister wasn’t even a year old. I thought I wouldn’t live. I was scared. I still am. It happened in Albuquerque New Mexico. I got found by Fernando. God bless him. I’m so grateful for him. I remember way more than I should. I’ve been worried about what to do. About what I am, and that I have no purpose. I’m so scared. Sometimes I don’t feel God or Jesus, but I just pray. Recently, my one of my best friends moved to her home country. She promised to come back, but the school year already started. I’m so worried that she won’t come back, and it hurts. Somebody who I really cared about moved out of the district without telling anybody. He was so fun to be around."
I would very much enjoy a hug.
