Bro just wants a hug from a little kid😂
"“Here is your stairs to heaven. Those steps are your sins Grover, all 1,048,576 of ‘em! You think yours is long? Wait til you’ve seen mine!’ Kermit said to Grover.

Grover has accepted the challenge to  climb the stairway to heaven. Each step marks a sin that he has committed in his past life. The bigger the sin, the bigger the step. If he climbs the entire thing, he’ll face judgement based on his efforts. Unfortunately, Grover made plenty of sins, about 1,048,376 of ‘em, and the stairs will turn into a slide every 7 days. But none of it deters Grover, he brought the Glock with him. Even if it does take an eternity to master the flight of stairs, he would be the muppet to kill God.


The stairs have yet to turn into a slide at seven days end, and those larger steps that were his grave steps were no match for his thirst to shoot and kill God. After only 6 days, 23 hours and 35 minutes, Grover has ascended most of the 1,048,576 steps to heaven. But to his shock, Kermit was up there waiting for him. 

“How can this be!!” Yelled Grover, “You were supposed to climb your own stairs, and it was bigger than mine, right!?” 

With a calm demeanor, Kermit answered him. “You’ve come a long way for your purpose, my child. But next week, let’s get serious and lay a foot on every step so you don’t look like a furry blue cheater.” Then Grover got his face kicked, and fell to the bottom. 

After many failures, Grover finally made it to heaven again at the top of his sinful steps. And this time, he remembered to push Kermit down before going in to complete his primary mission. As Grover concentrated on where God might be, he noticed a growing glow all around him. His teeth began vibrating as it reached a blinding crescendo, forcing him to shut his eyes tightly as he waited for his nemesis to appear. His head felt to be in the grip of a closing vice. In a terrified frenzy his words jumbled and somehow cried out. 

“Show me GOD!”
Instantly the buzzing and glowing stopped. Grover began to see himself in a puddle at his feet.

It stared him in the face. He had usurped God. He was handed down ultimate power in the moment of Kermit’s collapse, and it now in control of every aspect in the cosmos. The sun and moon, good and evil, and all the things sacred are in his hands to maintain alone. 

That was never part of the plan. Grover intended to shoot God. And by God, he will. 

“God? Where are you at you pale-ass bitch? I’m here for you, and I’ve got nothing to lose other than this gun I stole before I died!”

Grover didn’t get a response. 

“I know you’re hiding, I get it! Bertstrips weren’t supposed to be invented!”

Grover looked around for a few minutes before he realized God isn’t here. 

At this point he wondered if God was the Green frog he just shoved down the stairs. But in any case, he kept his guard up. 

God punishes Grover by flinging him out of the gates to heaven. Doomed to fall down the infinite staircase while breaking every bone in his body till the end of time.

How long has it been? Years? No, not years. Not decades, not centuries. No time. There was no time. He was still thinking like a mortal,  Grover knew, the day he left earth was the last day he’d ever be a part of. The moment before he entered the portal was the last time he had been a part of this world. Time is gone. All of eternity stretches forward forever. A single second, a million years. It’s all the same now.  The neon flashes of multicolored radiation that spilled forth from the distortion in deep space, the bright white of the world when he first entered the world. It had all melted together into a singular moment, a never ending eternity. Time was gone. On his quest to seek the unknown, Grover had become immortal.  Grover had died. He saw the birth of the universe, and he saw the heat death. And he could not tell the difference."
Hey what’s Jim doing there?
AHHH I STILL NEED MEDS
This is my favorite drawing so far of all this guy does
Lol

"Hey umm I was the guy at the window, I was just making sure he was fine though, like some people said, I did indeed kill a cop, but he threatened to shoot everybody in his sights. He was a bad cop…."
"No worries, he has a brother named Bob every day. He came camouflages himself so he doesn’t get caught when it’s dark out. He’s always black pure black. I can make smoke if it’s foggy."

Nice teeth
Man this new single by Mariah sounds amazing
Thanks bro! Now i wont terrify the kids
"That's Ivan he's nice he will watch over your child in any way he can when you're not watching. 
In your case Ivan is at the window not only to make sure your child doesn't do anything dangerous in their room but also to make sure no one else watches through the window. 
In some cases Ivan will come into your childs room to have a more direct way of protection. He will normally come in if your child isn't getting enough sleep and will makes sure they stay in bed for two reasons. 
Reason one is to make sure they stay in bed so they get more sleep
Reason two is to make sure your child doesn't wonder in dangerous areas of the house or worse the darkness"
The darkness holds many things that are not for a young child like your son
It’s Mariah Carey
Last short before sleeping AND I HAVE A WINDOW NEXT TO MY BEDDDDDD

The sound itself is completely different from the song. That's actually in the video. The sound doesn't exist in this video. It's just in the corner. Why does YouTube allow this period
Nice smile lets kiss
"Ok, creepy and all, but why is youtube saying that the melody in the backgroud is All I Want For Christmas Is You? Like- I might be wrong, but that thing behind the window is NOT Mariah Carey 😭😭😭"

"Oh! That's Bob, glad you encountered him. He chill af, he just keeps watch of your children at night and protects them from creeps, but the way he looks makes it look like he's the bad person. The kid asked for a doorbell because before Bob came, there were creeps. The kid thinks Bob is another creep, that's why! Bob told me this himself, that's why."

"For those who dont understand 

A missile is a self-propelled, airborne weapon, typically using a rocket motor or jet engine for propulsion. It's designed to travel to a target, often guided by onboard sensors and control systems, and carry a warhead. Ballistic missiles use a parabolic trajectory powered by rockets during launch, while cruise missiles are powered by jet engines for continuous flight. 
Key components and how they work:
Propulsion:
Rocket motors: Burn fuel to create thrust, propelling the missile forward, as described in an article from the Nuclear Threat Initiative. 
Jet engines: Provide continuous thrust during flight, as seen in cruise missiles. 
Guidance and Control:
Aerodynamic controls: Use fins and control surfaces to steer the missile and stabilize it in flight. 
Thrust vectoring: For ballistic missiles, this involves directing the engine's thrust to control the missile's path. 
Guidance systems: These systems use various sensors (like infrared, radar, or optical sensors) to track the target and adjust the missile's trajectory, as explained in a Britannica article. 
Examples of guidance systems: Infrared seekers can target heat sources like jet engine exhausts, while radar-guided missiles use radar to lock onto the target. 
Launch:
Boosters: Solid or liquid rocket motors provide the initial thrust to launch the missile. 
Launch tubes: Missiles are sometimes launched from tubes, as seen in an article from HowStuffWorks. 
Flight:
Ballistic missiles: Follow a trajectory that arcs upwards before descending to the target. 
Cruise missiles: Fly at a flatter trajectory, typically at lower altitudes. 
Warhead:
The missile's payload, which is designed to cause damage at impact."

"Thats Bob, he’s quite friendly, as he spies- i mean watches over your kids that are his victims- i mean his friends, while they are sleeping."
His room is on the second floor…
I am now aware of my surroundings whilst on the toilet
“Hey would you like some cookies from the girl scouts down the street?”
"He looks so goofy, I want befriend the man on the window."
Nah him? That’s Jim he won’t hurt u he is wanted in a few states but all around good fella👍
That's the most calmest child
For a second I thought it was going to be Mariah Carey 😭
i run outside as a good uncle and i start trowing hands with the monster
"Pretty cool story, here’s mine:

I never believed the stories the adults told about the Boogeyman. They were just tales to scare kids, I thought. But that night… that night, I learned there was something far worse than I could have imagined.

It was an autumn evening. The moon was hidden behind thick clouds, and the village was wrapped in a dense fog. All the other children were in bed, but I couldn’t sleep. The Boogeyman story kept echoing in my mind, but I wasn’t scared. I quietly slipped out of my house, determined to prove it was just a story.The fog swallowed me whole as I entered the woods. Every step felt louder than it should have, like the earth itself was trying to trap me. There was no sound, just the eerie rustling of leaves beneath my feet. The deeper I walked, the more something felt wrong, as if I was being watched.

Then, I heard it. A faint whisper, like the wind. “Luca…”

I froze. “Who’s there?” I asked, my voice trembling. But there was no answer, only the whispering fog.
Another whisper, closer this time. “Come play with me.”
My heart began to race. I wanted to turn back, but I forced myself to keep going, telling myself it was nothing. But the deeper I went, the thicker the fog became, and the silence felt heavier, like it was pressing down on me.

And then, I saw it. A towering shadow, its eyes gleaming like black holes, its smile twisted and inhuman. It was the Boogeyman.

“You’re not afraid of me, Luca?” its voice slithered into my mind, like a cold breath. “Come play with me.”

I tried to move, to scream, but my body wouldn’t respond. It felt like the fog was holding me in place. The Boogeyman drew closer, his claws sharp and ready to tear everything away.”Don’t run, Luca,” it whispered. “I’ve been waiting for you.”I couldn’t escape. The fear, the deep terror I had tried to deny, now felt like it was suffocating me. Its cold hands touched my face, sending a shock through my body. I saw something in its eyes—my own face. Twisted. Distorted. It was as if I was becoming the Boogeyman, or maybe I always had been.

Its claws dug into my arm, and I felt the pull of something dark, something consuming. There was no escape. My fear had brought me here. I had called him.
The fog swallowed me entirely. The world went black.
Now, every night, when the fog settles and the silence takes over, I hear the whisper: “Come play with me, Luca.”

And I know he’s still there, always."
Underrated as hell lol
muffled “hey! Hi there! Can I come in? It’s pretty cold out here!”
"""But we live on the 31st floor"""
one of these days its gonna jumpscare us and we will die

"Yeah he likes watching me too,  hes chill tho he won't hurt u unless u hurt him"
Thats Diddy Long Legs
Honey? Help me im locked out open the door
He wished that people didn't have to knock. Implying he would rather they just come in quietly. That implies he has let them in after knocking and just finds it annoying he has to let them in himself. Therefore who or whatever that is has spent time with him and hasn't done anything. So it's friendly.
"For those who don’t understand, he meant that there was someone watching him through his window"
Mariah that ain’t you…
"Ahhh, only if the mom remembered she has the second amendment."
"Smiling beautiful man: mama can I come in and play?


Little kid: No diabeto roll back to the kitchen."
The kid: He said his name is Jeff and hes really nice
Bubble wrap!  (Yes that's a nickname because he keeps kids safe from danger like bubble wrap does to fragile objects!)
That's just Derwin. He's chill. Unless he doesn't get his mcnuggets. You don't want that to happen. Trust me.
Why the monster kinda..😻😻.
"PUT THE KRISPY CREMES DOWN
MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER idk what
GITIGI quagmire noises"
"What most people expect: They run away

Reality: Mom beats the shit out of the monster"
That’s Jeffrey. He’s a chill guy. He’s friendly and watches and stalks people to see if they’re safe. He asked me for a cup of tea once. Nice guy.

"My family told me one day that when I was a kid, I would say the most phenomenal things known to man. This all started when my brother played the scary boardgame that talks to spirits. He never closed the game, causing the house to become haunted."

Would you like to play a horror story game?

• No. (Scroll down)
• Yes! (Play the game)


Rules:

1. Always stay with one of your friends and never be alone.
2. If you hear a security guard near you, hide immediately.
3. Do not steal from a store—leave money on the counter.
4. You need to be asleep by 2am.


🧡: You died!
❤️: You made a bad choice, but you survived.
💚: You’re safe… for now.

Context:
You are outside at about 7:30pm with your friends Samantha and Hailey. You are shopping at your local mall and it is almost closing time. Hailey brings up an idea to try and stay after hours at the mall. You are too scared to do it but she and Samantha are all for it.


#1: The final closing announcement is heard in the store you are in. If you don’t want to get caught, you have to hide. Where are you hiding?

a) Sephora
b) Hair Salon
c) Clothing Store

❤️: There wasn’t enough space for you and your friends to hide, and you got caught. You were killed by your parents.
💛: You hid with all the supplies in the break room, but were very close to being found.
💚: You were safe because you and your friends hid in clothing racks during closing.


#2: After all the security guards left, you needed to find food because you and your friends were hungry. You walk into a candy shop and grab something you like. What do you do next?

a) Make it look like someone robbed the store at night and you left without paying.
b) Leave a $10 bill that has been around the store at night to pay for the things you took.
c) Grab only a little bit of candy so the owner doesn’t notice anything and leave.

❤️: The security guard hears the commotion and finds you and your friends.
💚: Your sense of decency saved you and your friends from whatever consequences would have come if you hadn’t paid.
💛: You are safe for the night and nobody is hurt. For now…


#3: Hailey gets a notification on her phone that someone robbed the store. You three have to make up a lie that will save all of you from your parents. What do you do?

a) Tell Hailey’s mom that you will be back in the morning and that you are sleeping over at another friend’s house.

💛: You were close to death, but luckily Hailey’s mom is very chill, so she didn’t ask any follow-up questions.
❤️: Her mom wasn’t questioning anything, but texted Samantha’s mom to ask how the girls were doing. You all were killed the next day.
💛: Close call on getting caught, but she just thought you were busy and didn’t ask anything again.


#4: It’s getting late and you made a pile of clothes to sleep on that are hidden away. Samantha can’t sleep and Hailey’s snoring is preventing you from sleeping. What do you do?

You Relax a bit and try to sleep again.

💛: You ended up fast asleep in 2 minutes, and so did Samantha. You are safe tonight.


#5: It is around 4:45am and you hear a loud bang. Somehow only you wake up and everyone else is fast asleep. You decide to wake up your friends and explore the sound. What do you do next?

a) Go downstairs to the main area where you can see almost everything on the first floor.
b) You both separate and go into different stores searching for the source of the noise.
c) You stay on the second floor and explore quietly making sure everyone is safe.

❤️: Staying in the main area leaves you open to anything around you including security guards.
❤️: Well you died, never go alone in a horror game/movie.


#6: You and your friends figure out the sound was caused by a bookshelf falling in the bookstore, but you were seen by a security guard after picking this out. What do you do?

a) Run.
b) Hide.
c) Throw books at the security guard.

💛: You got away but you were out of breath and Samantha had trouble turning on the car which led to a close call with the security guard.
💔: You hid in one of the aisles and the security guard looked around and ran out of the store looking for you.
💖: The books slowed the security guard down, you got away, but he saw your face."

"Jack was 8 years old. His dad was a scientist. It was bring your kid to work day so Jack got to go to the science lab, it was very big, so, his dad told him to stay close, but that made him get bored very fast. “I’m bored!” He whined,so, his dad said he could go explore, just he couldn’t touch anything. So he explored for 10 minutes until he got thirsty. Luckily, he saw some water bottles. He opened one and drank it, but he started feeling weird, like something was burning inside him. He then realized, it was chemicals. He ran as fast as he could back to his dad, but the burning got worse every second, he then felt like he couldn’t breathe, he stopped running and was gasping for air. He then went pale and fell to the ground. His dad got worried about Jack, so he started searching for him, later he found him on the floor with something coming out of his mouth, Jacks dad froze as he realized that it was one of the chemicals. Jacks lungs were getting burned because of the chemicals. Apparently he had also drank gasoline, Jack got rushed to the hospital. But he sadly had died. The science lab had to close down because, sometimes, they would see the body of Jack."

"True story

Yes another true story me and my friends love to run away from parties so we can discover crazy stuff, this is actually true but not as scary as the forest one. So me and my friends   Decided to go upstairs as we realized the doors were opened, keep in reminder this party was hosted in a church so when we went upstairs the 2nd floor wasn’t as dark so we went up another and it was pitch black nothing in sight just total darkness, we sticked go the second floor and we went to the second door where the church begins and no joke you know How the priest rings the bell whenever they start and end a prayer? We legit heard that at the end of the rooms, Ik we are crazy and we try to get a good look at things when it’s interesting but I’m NOT looking for who or what made that sound because oof it was also pitch black in the church room. But we are okay 👍"
"Lie Berry – Soviet Edition 

Viktor Ivanovich was never the son they wanted. His parents staunch Party loyalists dreamed of a fencer who would bring glory to the Motherland. Composed. Victorious. A model Soviet youth. But the gym taught him silence, not discipline. He learned to breathe through bruised ribs and hide split lips from the mirror. His teammates didn’t train. They punished.

When Viktor walked away to become a military officer, his family didn’t protest. They simply erased him. No letters. No visits. Just absence. Like he’d been purged from their personal archives.

Years later, silence returned.

Two librarians vanished from the State Archive of Revolutionary Memory. No struggle. No blood.

That night, Viktor stood on his balcony, cigarette trembling, when his neighbor emerged from the fog a old lady with a bowl of dark, violet berries.

“Lie Berries,” she said. “They don’t lie. They just remember differently.”

Viktor frowned.

“They supposed to help me forget? Or make it all taste sweeter?”

She smiled, gold tooth shining.

“They reveal the parts your mind won’t let you see.”

He hesitated. Then bit down.



 Memory Vault: Gym Inferno

His vision was blurred.

He was back in the gym but it was on fire. Soviet banners curled in flame. The air reeked of sweat, smoke, and scorched propaganda. The fencing mats had melted into blackened scars. Every breath tasted like ash and adrenaline.

He stepped in from the left, silhouette framed by fire. No blade. Just fury.

Arkady Volkov charged first, swinging a mop handle like a club.
Viktor sidestepped, grabbed a metal bench leg, and twirled it like a spear, slamming it into Arkady’s ribs.
Arkady doubled over. Viktor spun, kicked him in the chest, and sent him flying into a flaming stack of mats.

Mikhail “Misha” Sokolov came next, trash lid raised like a shield.
Viktor vaulted off a locker, landed behind him, and delivered a spinning elbow to the spine.
Misha dropped the shield. Viktor grabbed it mid-fall and bashed his head three times each hit echoing like a war drum.

Yevgeny “Zhenya” Morozov tried to flank him, fast and slippery.
Viktor caught a broken pipe, twirled it like a staff, and swept Zhenya’s legs.
He fell hard. Viktor flipped the pipe, jammed it under his chin, and lifted forcing Zhenya to stare into the fire before slamming him down.

Timofey “Tima” Baranov, the coward, backed toward the bathroom door.

“You’re not gonna touch me,” he hissed. “You’re just a memory.”

Viktor sprinted.


CRASH.
Tima flew through the door, shattered porcelain exploding around him.


Viktor stepped into the steam soaked chaos.
Tima scrambled to his feet, joined by the others bloodied, desperate, but not done.

Arkady lunged again. Viktor grabbed a towel rack, ripped it free, and hooked it behind Arkady’s neck, slamming him into the mirror.
Glass rained down. Arkady didn’t rise.

Misha tackled him. Viktor twisted, flipped him over, and drove a knee into his chest.
He grabbed a sink pipe and cracked it across Misha’s jaw, sending him sprawling.

Zhenya tried to stab him with a shard. Viktor caught his wrist, snapped it, and threw him into a stall.
He kicked the toilet tank until it burst flooding the stall with boiling steam.

Tima crawled toward the exit.

Viktor followed.

He knelt beside him, mirror shard in hand.

“You remember me now?”

He didn’t stab.

He pressed the shard into Tima’s hand—a reflection, not a wound.

Then stood.

Silhouetted by fire.

Then came the ringing.

Shrill. Bone-deep.

A flash.

A hand on his shoulder.l



Awakening

He snapped awake.

Balcony. Night. Sweat. Silence.

The babushka knelt beside him, eyes wide.

“You took too many,” she whispered. “They don’t just show you the past. They make you live it.”

The gym was gone.

But his fists still throbbed like he’d shattered bones.

The bowl beside him held only one Lie Berry left.



The Descent

The next morning, Viktor returned to the archive with the inspection team. Officers Ramosov and Morin led the sweep. Sample collection. Light scans. Infrared failures. Everything felt wrong.

Viktor wandered toward the back shelf.

Found the lever behind a warped panel.

Pulled it.

The floor cracked and collapsed.

He caught a steel beam mid-descent, boots kicking into void. Beneath him stretched a buried chamber crates, vents, stone walls sweating.

Above, his team scrambled to throw ropes.

One light popped.

Then another.

Then all.

Red emergency lighting flooded the chamber.

Smoke hissed from the ceiling. Dense. Synthetic. Alive.

Then movement.

It didn’t walk.

It dropped.

The creature tore through the fog, limbs like bone tipped tendrils, body rippling in angles no spine should bend. Its central eye blazed molten gold and red. Not just seeing.

Knowing.

Ramosov screamed. A tendril wrapped around him and hurled him sideways. His spine cracked loud enough to echo.

Morin limped forward, one arm gone, gripping Viktor’s sidearm. He reached Viktor, eyes wild not with terror.

With guilt.

Then the monster pierced him.

The weapon flew loose. It struck Viktor’s head.

And Viktor fell.

Down into dust, blood, and ringing silence.

The Vault

He woke in the dark.

A terminal blinked in the corner.

Containment Subroutine 303 Delta ACTIVE

⚔️ CRYSTAL ASCENSION

Genre: Action • Superpower • Sci-Fi • Drama • Destiny
Setting: 2025 — A world quietly recovering from a global disaster known as The Depth Break.

🌍 EPISODE 1 — “THE POWERLESS BOY”

gostu kowng kainin an eyong teti 🥵!
Alright, partner — you want Episode 1 written like a real anime pilot episode, long, cinematic, emotional, deep, and detailed — about 10,000 characters, full story energy, like something straight out of an anime novel script

🌌 EPISODE 1 — “The Powerless One”

(Tokyo, Japan – Year 2025)

The world had changed quietly, without anyone truly realizing when it began.
It wasn’t the internet, the machines, or even the endless wars — it was the light beneath the Earth.

Fifty years ago, scientists dug too deep beneath the Pacific. They called it Project Depthstar, the largest geological expedition ever attempted by humankind. The mission was meant to explore the planet’s lower crust — but what they discovered was not rock, or lava. It was something that pulsed. Something alive.

When they drilled into it, the world changed forever.

A glowing liquid — the Aether Substance — surged from the fissure. It shimmered like starlight trapped in water, humming at a frequency that broke every sensor. Within minutes, it hardened into five massive shards, each the size of a car.

The scientists labeled them the Celestial Crystals.
Each shard radiated an energy field that could warp magnetism, light, even gravity. But within weeks, everyone exposed to it started to change. Some became stronger. Faster. Capable of impossible things.

Others… simply vanished.

The world governments shut it all down, sealing the truth. But they couldn’t hide the side effects forever. Over the decades, trace particles of that same glowing matter spread into the air.

By 2025, a new generation of humans began awakening abilities — powers that defied reason. They called it Aether Affinity.

Those blessed with it became heroes, soldiers, or criminals.
And those without? They were forgotten.

🏙️ Tokyo – Sector 9, Slum District

In the middle of the ruined city, surrounded by flickering neon and cracked buildings, a teenage boy tightened the strap of a broken drone. Sparks popped from the circuit.

“Come on, just a little more…” he muttered, sweat dripping down his cheek.

Syian Kuragane, sixteen years old.
Dark hair, soft brown eyes, hands scarred from work.

The scanner on the table beside him blinked “0.00% Aether detected.”

He stared at it blankly. The same number. Every day.

“Still nothing, huh?” said a voice.

Syian turned to see Hana, a girl his age with silver hair tied in a ponytail and a thin breathing tube over her nose. Her eyes were kind but faintly tired.

“Yeah,” Syian sighed. “Guess I’ll just stick to fixing junk forever.”

Hana smiled. “You’re still better than most people with powers. At least you actually work.”

Syian chuckled softly. “Says the girl who can light up a room when she laughs.”

She coughed. It wasn’t a small cough. Blood flecked her lip.

Syian froze. “Hana—”

“I’m fine.” She wiped it quickly, forcing a grin. “It’s just the Aether again. The doctor said it’s stable.”

That was a lie. Syian knew it. The truth was, Hana’s body was collapsing.
She’d been born with too much Aether energy. It burned her from the inside, like her veins were carrying lightning.

If anyone deserved powers, it was her.
If anyone didn’t, it was him.

Syian sighed, looking out the cracked window at the bright skyline beyond the slums. Towers of Aether-run energy systems glowed like stars. Airships hummed overhead.

“People out there,” he said quietly, “can move mountains with their minds. And I can’t even move a spark.”

Hana tilted her head. “Then maybe you’re meant to move hearts instead.”

He laughed. “That’s corny, Hana.”

She grinned. “You love corny.”

⚙️ Later that night

Rain poured endlessly. Thunder rolled like drums.

Syian walked through the flooded streets, hood pulled up, carrying a toolbox. He’d spent the whole day fixing drones for food credits, barely enough for Hana’s medicine.

The world was cruel to people like him.
Powerless. Invisible. Forgotten.

He passed by a giant holo-ad projected across a skyscraper — a man in armor surrounded by flames.

“Join the Aether Security Force. Protect humanity from the rogue crystal wielders!”

The ASF were everywhere now. They hunted those who illegally possessed the Celestial Crystals. Rumor said they had one of the five themselves, using it to create an army.

Syian didn’t care. He just wanted Hana to survive.

Lightning flashed.

For a brief moment, the sky burned blue — unnaturally blue.

Then something crashed into the outskirts of the slum with an ear-splitting BOOM. The ground shook.

People screamed. Windows shattered. Alarms blared.

Syian froze. His heart pounded. “That… wasn’t thunder.”

Without thinking, he ran toward the crater.

⚡ The Crater

Steam hissed from the ground. The air vibrated like a heartbeat.

At the center, surrounded by shattered concrete, was something glowing — a crystal the size of his fist, beating like a living heart.

Blue light reflected in Syian’s eyes. It pulsed once. Then twice.

“Wh-what is this…” he whispered, stepping closer.

The air around him bent slightly, the raindrops slowing midair.

He reached out.

The moment his fingers touched the surface, the light exploded.

Everything stopped.

The rain froze in the air. His heartbeat echoed like thunder. The world around him dissolved into white space.

A voice — calm, ancient, echoing — filled his head.

“For centuries, the world has taken from me.
Fire, water, air, spirit, light — torn apart.
I wait for one whose soul is hollow enough… to carry the whole.”

Syian fell to his knees, clutching his chest. “Wh-what are you talking about?!”

“You are empty, child. That is your gift.”

The crystal shattered — not into pieces, but into light.
The shards flew into his chest, merging with his heartbeat.

Pain. Searing, endless pain.

He screamed as veins of light spread across his body.
Then darkness swallowed him whole.

"When my sister Betsy and I were kids, our family lived for awhile in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the ghost. We called her Mother, because she seemed so kind and nurturing. Some mornings Betsy and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we’d find a cup that hadn’t been there the night before. Mother had left them there, worried that we’d get thirsty during the night. She just wanted to take care of us. Among the homes’ original furnishings was an antique wooden chair which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, Mother would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. Sometimes she’d manage to move it all the way to the centre of the room. We always felt sad putting it back against the wall. Mother just wanted to be near us. Years later, long after we’d moved out, I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse’s original occupant, a widow. She’d murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she hung herself. The article included a photo of the farmhouse’s living room, with a woman’s body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room.”

"For those who dont know:
Once upon a sigma dawn, there was Larry, the boy of destiny.
Larry ate the forbidden Quaker Oats of Power. Suddenly, the sky cracked open…

From the rift stepped Future Larry, stronger, darker, fueled by endless oats.
Future Larry growled:
""I shall consume you, my past self, and become Omega Larry!""

But Present Larry shouted with all his might:
“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!” 🗣️

The oats within him ignited. He unlocked the ancient art of Sigma Skibidi Ligma-Balls Power 💥.
Lightning struck. Toilets trembled. The universe itself meowed in fear.

In that moment, King Larry ascended…
Neither past nor future could stop him.
He became The Eternal Sigma Overlord Larry — ruler of oats, destroyer of cringe, master of ultimate rizz.

After defeating Future Larry with his Skibidi Ligma-Balls Power, King Larry stood among the ruins of reality itself. Time was shattered, and across the fragments appeared strange enemies…

The Toilet Lords of Skibidi Prime 🚽👑
They chanted in unison:
""Skibidi dop dop yes yes, Larry must fall, Larry must fall…""

But Larry was no ordinary sigma. He summoned the Oat Blade of Eternity, forged from 10,000 Quaker oats compressed into a single grain of ultimate crunch. 🌾⚔️

With a single swing, Larry unleashed the Rizz Shockwave, obliterating entire armies of toilets. The skies echoed with his battle cry:
“NO ONE EATS LARRY… EXCEPT LARRY!”

Yet in the shadows, a new figure stirred…
Ultra Future Larry X — a being beyond even time itself, fused with infinite oats and forbidden Skibidi energy.

The prophecy whispered:
""Only Sigma Larry may defeat Sigma Larry… but at what cost?

The skies cracked like glass. From the void descended Ultra Future Larry X, his body glowing with forbidden Skibidi runes, his aura radiating endless Quaker Oats dust. 🌌🌾

“Present Larry… you are weak. You are cringe. I am based.”
His voice shattered mountains. Toilets across the multiverse flushed in fear. 🚽💀

But King Larry stood tall upon his Sigma Throne of Rizz, eyes glowing with oat-fueled power.
“You forget one thing, Ultra Larry… I AM THE OAT.”

He unleashed the Ligma Ball Cataclysm, a blast so powerful it erased entire timelines. Future Larry X countered with the Giga Skibidi Collapse, bending reality into toilet-shaped portals.

Across a million dimensions, the battle raged:
🐾 Larry slashed with his Oat Blade of Eternity.
🚽 Ultra Larry X summoned armies of Toilet Lords.
⚡ The clash shook the multiverse, each strike rewriting history itself.

Finally, Larry tapped into the Ultimate Sigma Transformation — his fur became golden, his meows shook galaxies, and his eyes turned into blazing oatmeal suns. 🌞🐾

The cosmos stood still. Every galaxy, every star, every oat in existence watched as King Larry and Ultra Future Larry X clashed one last time.

The Oat Blade of Eternity blazed with the power of breakfast itself. 🌾⚔️
The Giga Skibidi Collapse twisted the skies into a swirling toilet vortex. 🚽🌌

Larry’s whiskers glowed. His meow became a warcry.
“I am not weak. I am not cringe. I… AM… KING LARRY!”

With a final leap, he poured every ounce of Sigma Skibidi Ligma-Balls Power into one strike:
THE FINAL FLUSH. 💥🚽👑

Time shattered. Toilets exploded across the multiverse. Ultra Future Larry X screamed, dissolving into oat dust that scattered across infinity.

Silence fell.
Only one Larry remained.
The Eternal King. The Unstoppable Sigma. The Alpha of Alphas.

King Larry sat upon the Throne of Infinite Oats, his legend carved into reality itself.
And thus it was written:
“Larry shall reign forever. The Sigma King of Skibidi. The Oatlord Supreme"

"Okay, here is a scary story for you: The old lighthouse stood sentinel against the jagged coastline, its beam a lonely finger slicing through the perpetual fog. Locals called it the Widow's Watch, a name earned from the countless wives who had watched their husbands sail away, never to return, their ships swallowed by the unforgiving sea. I, a marine biologist named Elias Thorne, had come to study the unusual bioluminescent algae blooms that thrived in the turbulent waters surrounding the lighthouse. I dismissed the local legends as superstition, the product of generations spent battling the elements. But the Widow's Watch had a way of making you question your convictions. The lighthouse keeper, a grizzled old man named Silas, was a man of few words. His face was a roadmap of wrinkles etched by wind and worry, his eyes as deep and gray as the ocean itself. He warned me about the ""callers,"" the whispers that rode the wind, the shadows that danced in the periphery, the feeling of being watched even when alone. I chuckled, attributing it to the isolation and the constant drone of the foghorn. My research began uneventfully. I collected samples, analyzed data, and marveled at the ethereal glow of the algae blooms. But as the days turned into weeks, the unsettling feeling that Silas had described began to creep into my mind. It started subtly, a prickling sensation on the back of my neck, a fleeting glimpse of movement in the corner of my eye. Then came the whispers, carried on the wind, unintelligible murmurs that seemed to claw at the edges of my sanity. One night, as I worked late in the lamp room, the rhythmic sweep of the light suddenly faltered. The beam flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that writhed on the walls. The foghorn fell silent, plunging the lighthouse into an unnerving stillness. A cold dread washed over me, paralyzing me with fear. Then, I heard it – a scraping sound, like nails dragging against stone, coming from the spiral staircase that wound its way down the lighthouse tower. It was slow, deliberate, and relentless, each scrape sending shivers down my spine. I grabbed a wrench, my hand trembling, and braced myself against the door, my heart pounding in my chest. The scraping grew louder, closer, until it was right outside the door. I could feel the vibrations through the wood, the palpable sense of something immense and malevolent on the other side. I held my breath, waiting for the inevitable. Suddenly, the scraping stopped. An eerie silence descended, broken only by the frantic beating of my own heart. Then, a voice, raspy and guttural, whispered from the other side of the door. ""Elias…"" My blood ran cold. How did it know my name? I didn't answer, afraid to break the spell, afraid of what might happen if I acknowledged its presence. The voice whispered again, closer this time, its breath seeming to seep through the cracks in the door. ""Elias… come home…"" The voice was hypnotic, alluring, promising something I couldn't quite grasp. I felt an irresistible urge to open the door, to succumb to its call, to step into the darkness and embrace whatever awaited me on the other side. But something held me back, a flicker of rationality, a desperate clinging to my sanity. I remembered Silas's warnings, the stories of the Widow's Watch, the countless souls lost to the sea. I knew that whatever was on the other side of that door was not of this world, that it was something ancient and malevolent, something that craved to consume me. I stumbled back from the door, knocking over a toolbox. The clang shattered the silence, breaking the spell. The voice hissed in anger, the scraping resumed, more frantic this time, as if whatever was on the other side was desperately trying to break through. I knew I had to escape. I scrambled to the window, ignoring the pleas of the voice, the relentless scraping at the door. I threw open the window, the icy wind whipping through the room, carrying with it the salty tang of the sea. Below me, the waves crashed against the rocks, a swirling vortex of foam and darkness. It was a long drop, but it was my only chance. I took a deep breath and jumped. The cold water shocked my system, stealing my breath. I plunged into the depths, the darkness closing in around me. I fought my way to the surface, gasping for air, the waves tossing me like a rag doll. I looked back at the lighthouse, its beam still flickering erratically, casting grotesque shadows on the fog. The scraping had stopped, but I could still feel its presence, watching me, waiting for me to return. I swam towards the shore, driven by a primal fear, the whispers of the ""callers"" chasing me through the waves. I finally reached the beach, collapsing on the sand, exhausted and terrified. I didn't stop running until I reached the town, my clothes soaked, my body trembling. I told the sheriff what had happened, but he dismissed it as a hallucination, the product of stress and isolation. I knew he didn't believe me, but I didn't care. I was alive, and that was all that mattered. I left the town the next morning, vowing never to return. But the Widow's Watch had left its mark on me. The whispers still haunted my dreams, the scraping still echoed in my ears. I knew that I would never truly escape the clutches of the lighthouse, that a part of me would always remain there, lost to the sea. Years later, I heard that Silas had disappeared. They found his boat adrift, with no sign of him. The locals whispered that the ""callers"" had finally claimed him, that he had succumbed to their allure and joined the countless souls lost to the Widow's Watch. Sometimes, late at night, when the wind is howling and the fog is thick, I hear the whispers again, carried on the wind, calling my name. And I know that one day, I will have to return to the Widow's Watch, to face the darkness that awaits me there, to finally answer the call of the sea."
"[the man watching in the woods] {… there was a group of friends that would meet at the woods and ride in there. One day, one of the friends found a footprint even though they never walked in the woods. They explored more and found an abandoned house 🏚️ it said KEEP OUT ⚠️ they decided they would go in the abandoned house.. but once you go in there.. you never come back out later.. so as the friends went in the house the door went SLAM 💥 the door was locked 🔒 it was like it was glued. One friend tried pulling the door. The other one tried to find a window to escape but… no windows to be found… they were starving until one friend said they brought alot of snacks if they were hungry while exploring the woods. As the 3 sat down on the old rusty bench and eating fruit snacks. They heard a LOUD BANG. One friend said “what was that…?” The other friends said  nervously “it might be someone trying to open in..” friend 2 said “let’s see who is there..” friend 1 looked at friend 2 and said “there’s no windows! How are we supposed to tell who is there..?” Friend 3 said “no! No! I found a window in this broken bathroom come look!” the friends slowly walk to the bathroom and looked in there friend 1 says “it is a window! I probably didn’t check there…” as friend 1 scratches their head friend 2 said nervously “uhm… should we go and.. you know.. investigate who is banging..? Friend 3 said “Hell no! Did you even hear that bang? It sounded real scary..” friend 2 crosses her arms “we are all real ladies we shouldn’t be scared! Unless you’re scared!” Friend 1 says “we are real ladies! Come on! Don’t be babies. It’s just a window she looks out “mmm… I don’t really see not- THE LOUD BANG COMES AGAIN friend 3 said “is this place haunted?! Yeah we should probably try to escape..” friend 2 said confidently “I got this! Besides we can use the window” friend 2 tries to break the window open only to hurt their hand friend 2 says while grunting “ugh, that hurt.. is this window made of metal..?!” Friend 3 looks at friend 2 weirdly and says “oh come on! Window’s aren’t even made of metal it’s not that hard I’m sure it’s just a normal window..?” Friend 1 says  interrupting friend 3 “we need to get out of here thats a- friend 1 looks outside again and sees a black tall figure standing behind the woods friend 1 says nervously “yup! I knew it. We shouldn’t went here in the first place.. we need to leave ASAP!” Part 2 coming soon."

"For those who dont know: Circus peanuts are a curious and polarizing confection, notable for their bright orange color, spongy texture, and artificial banana flavor. Though often categorized as a “retro” candy, circus peanuts have endured for more than a century in American culture. This document explores the origins, characteristics, production, and cultural significance of circus peanuts, along with their unusual role in candy history.

⸻

2. Origins and History

The exact origin of circus peanuts is somewhat unclear, but they first gained popularity in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These marshmallow candies were originally sold as a seasonal treat by traveling circuses and five-and-dime stores, often delivered in bulk barrels.

At the time, their appeal came from their novelty and affordability. Early versions were not standardized in flavor or color, but the bright orange hue and banana flavor soon became standard—partly due to the limited variety of flavorings available and the low cost of artificial banana extract.

Circus peanuts became available year-round after the advent of packaging and better food preservation methods in the mid-20th century.

⸻

3. Ingredients and Production

Despite their name, circus peanuts contain neither peanuts nor any nut-based ingredients. They are peanut-shaped for novelty purposes.

Typical ingredients include:
	•	Sugar
	•	Corn syrup
	•	Gelatin
	•	Artificial flavor (typically banana)
	•	Food coloring (often FD&C Yellow #6 for the orange variety)

The candy is produced through a process similar to that used for marshmallows: the mixture is whipped, poured into peanut-shaped molds, and left to partially air-dry, creating their characteristic spongy-yet-dense texture.

⸻

4. Flavor and Texture Profile

Circus peanuts are often described as having:
	•	Texture: Chewy and airy, somewhat grainier and denser than standard marshmallows
	•	Flavor: Artificial banana, reminiscent of banana Runts or old-fashioned medicine

These features make the candy divisive. While some enjoy its nostalgic charm and unique flavor, others find the taste and texture off-putting.

⸻

5. Variations and Brand History

While the orange, banana-flavored version is most well-known, other versions have existed, including:
	•	Pink (vanilla)
	•	Yellow (lemon)
	•	White (possibly wintergreen or unflavored)

However, the orange variety remains the most produced and recognized.

Major manufacturers include:
	•	Spangler Candy Company – One of the longest-standing producers, credited with keeping circus peanuts in circulation well into the 21st century.

⸻

6. Legacy and Cultural Significance

Circus peanuts occupy a unique space in American candy culture. They are often cited in “worst candy” rankings but retain a loyal niche fan base. Their long shelf life and distinct look have made them a common subject in nostalgic retrospectives and candy-themed pop culture media.

Interesting Fact: In the 1960s, a food scientist experimenting with chopped circus peanuts and gelatin created what eventually became Lucky Charms cereal—one of the first cereals to include marshmallow bits (or “marbits”).

⸻

7. Criticism and Decline

With changing tastes and a rise in consumer demand for natural flavors and less processed treats, circus peanuts have declined in popularity. Many modern consumers associate them with outdated or stale candy offerings. Nonetheless, they continue to be produced and sold, particularly in retro-themed candy stores and online.

⸻



Circus peanuts are a resilient relic of a bygone era in American candy-making—bizarre, beloved by a few, reviled by others, and unmistakably iconic. Whether as a nostalgic snack or a curiosity for the adventurous sweet tooth, circus peanuts remain a quirky staple of the confectionery landscape.

This happened to me when I was 13 (I’m 26 now!)
I was awake at my usual time, not sleeping at all being too focused on games, everyone was asleep. I forced myself to stay awake. Until I heard my sister, usually she just busts in without asking (normally) but this time? Her voice called out ‘can I come in?’ I knew something was off so I said ‘no go away’ but then I heard a soft knock, I ofc got scared and hid like my blanket was fvcking bullet proof, and I hid underneath my bed, the knock got louder and louder, and I started to call 911 on my iPad bc I was SO SCARED BRO! And 911 was dumb asf and said ‘okay ma’am calm down tell me your name’ and I screamed ‘ITS — NOW COME HERE ITS SO LOUD!’ And they said ‘we will be there fastly’ and I waited for hours and nothing happened, no police, but the banging stopped and I just forced myself asleep, (yes underneath my bed still) and blah blah blah woke up never told anyone and all that too lazy to type more to blah blah blah end of movie bye bye"
"*The 8th Floor*

Dr. Aris Thorne worked late. Always late. His genetics lab occupied the sterile, humming 7th floor of the Kronos Biotech Tower – a monument to glass, steel, and relentless progress. Tonight, exhaustion blurred the fluorescent lines of the hallway as he finally packed up. The digital clock above the elevator glowed **2:17 AM**.

He pressed the call button. The usual soft chime echoed, but the descent felt… heavier. The car arrived with a groan that wasn't part of its usual repertoire. Inside, the polished steel walls seemed duller, the air thick and stale, smelling faintly of ozone and damp concrete. He pressed ‘G’ for the ground floor lobby.

The descent began smoothly, then jolted. The lights flickered violently, plunging Aris into utter darkness for three heart-stopping seconds before returning, dimmer now, casting long, trembling shadows. The digital display above the door froze: **8**.

Aris frowned. Kronos Tower only had seven floors. Everyone knew that. Floor 8 was a myth, a ghost story whispered by interns after too much coffee – a bureaucratic error in the blueprints, a space never built, sealed off.

The elevator stopped with a final, bone-rattling clang. The doors didn’t open. Aris mashed the ‘Door Open’ button. Nothing. He pressed ‘G’ again, then ‘7’. The buttons lit up dully but the elevator remained inert. Panic, cold and slick, began to crawl up his spine. He hammered on the doors. ""Hello? Anyone? Malfunction!""

Silence. Thick, oppressive, listening silence. Then, a sound. Faint at first, like dry leaves skittering across stone. It grew closer, resolving into a chorus of hushed, frantic *whispers*. They seemed to come from all around him, from the very walls of the elevator car, overlapping and unintelligible, yet filled with an unmistakable edge of terror and warning.

""...wrong floor...""  
""...shouldn't be here...""  
""...never existed...""  
""...get out...get out...GET OUT...""

Aris backed into a corner, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The whispers intensified, becoming more desperate, almost weeping. He covered his ears, but the sound wormed its way in, vibrating in his skull.

Suddenly, the elevator lights died completely. Utter, suffocating blackness. The whispers stopped. In the absolute void, Aris could hear only his own frantic heartbeat and… something else. A slow, wet, dragging sound. Like something heavy, wrapped in sodden cloth, being pulled across the floor… outside the elevator doors.

Thump… scrape… thump… scrape…

It stopped right in front of the doors. Aris froze, sweat chilling on his brow. He could feel a presence, vast and impossibly cold, radiating through the steel. A faint, greenish light began to seep under the elevator doors – a sickly, unnatural glow that illuminated nothing but the thin gap.

Then, a single, guttural sound came from the other side, not a word, but a vibration that shook the floor beneath his feet: *""M̶̹̊̕͝İ̸͍̽̊N̷̠̒E̵̩̗̿̎̐.""*

The elevator jolted violently upwards. The lights snapped back on, blindingly bright. The digital display whirred: *7... 6... 5...* Aris collapsed against the wall, trembling uncontrollably.

The doors slid open smoothly onto the pristine, brightly lit lobby. The night security guard looked up from his desk, frowning. ""Dr. Thorne? You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Aris stumbled out, unable to speak, his eyes fixed on the elevator panel. The button for Floor 8 was gone. In its place was smooth, unmarked steel, as if it had never existed.

He never worked late again. But sometimes, alone in his 7th-floor lab late at night, he'd hear it – a faint, distant thump… scrape… from the elevator shaft. And he’d remember the suffocating dark, the desperate whispers, and the chilling, possessive hunger in that single, impossible word echoing from the floor that shouldn’t be. He knew, with cold certainty, that the 8th floor was real. And it was waiting."

"The forest entity:
One day a family👪 was driving home when the car suddenly broke down. It was fine as the dad knew how to fix cars. As he was fixing the car the child walked into the forest. The parents looked for the child and saw.. Blood. And claw marks. Then they heard a scream. It was the child.. They went to it but. There were missing posters of the child and multiple other kids and adults. They all had blood on them.


Lore before the next chapter!
So the forest entity is a tall skiny creature that controlls people to kill them.
If somone is being controlled theese things will happen😨👇
1 (stay in your house to stay safe) : time will slow down for you.

4 (your dead sorry) it will rip you in half





The forest entity chapter 2: the parents started to see time slow down and they panicked. They got to the car and it was working finally they drove home but they were still PANICKING.

the entity found them.... They followed it into the woods. And died.
The next day a detective🕵 decided to look for the entity but it was to late. The entity was taller than the tallest tree on earth. Everyone could see it. Its. Its. Long claws. Skinny body. And pitch black eyes. With bloody teeth. And those. Legs. They were super tall and skinny it ate building trees even full citys!




Chapter 3 the great battle: some hunters went to the entity and shot it but it wasent enough. The entity stabbed theyre eyes with its claws. Making them blind they shot it uncontrollably and hit its pitch black eyes making it blind it shot out toxic goo from its mouth it destroyed earth until finally the hunters killed it..







Or did they...










The entity: hahaha silly hunters you humans will never realise this was a mistake... 



The entity became a giant spider it was still skinny but now it could see again. It killed the hunters but then. The scientist who created it killed it.







Or did he?








Ending: the entity killed everyone.
































Oh still here huh? LORE TIME.

The scientist who made the entity (mill willers) made it not to destroy but to make new life. He was going to make a new animal 
a giant creature with tusks and fur. But it had a super long tail that it would use to kill its prey. But somthing went wrong the scientist put the (earth destruction) ability and the (talking) ability in the mixture making a monster the scientist survived but was injured. Badly. His face was bleeding. He lost a eye. His head fell off after the great battle."

staring down to the floor I called her name out no reply I looked down with her she had millions of dead animals in a pile I stared in fear before she looked at me I ran outside the dorm when I got into my SUV but before long I heard the same faint noise I stopped at a gas station pretending to go get a snack I grabbed a bag of peanuts but I put them back I went up to the cashier and told her that there was someone or something in my back seat so we both went out but something felt off the woman had a long grin she looked at it but her face disfigured and she vanished I looked and a dead body was in my car I looked at the body it was the the lady I just spoke to but she looked human this time I looked back and there was my roommate standing inside the gas station just grinning at me I

terrible I looked back my roommate or at least I think she was my roommate her mouth was wider than before she then stepped closer to me her body twisted as her hair fell out she then started running toward me and pushed me out of a window (edit:part 2):I woke up I saw my roommate she was tied up to my ceiling I saw a disfigured creature just staring at me through the window as it vanished I noticed that it left a trail of blood on my roof I opened my window and followed the trail I saw 5 figures that looked exactly like my roommate as I tried backing away I tripped and fell into a thorn bush as I opened my eyes I saw them just staring at me with candles in there hand suddenly a knock on the door echoed they went to the door I Ran out the window I was on the edge of the roof when I

apologizing she slapped me and pushed me down I gasped for air she just walked out I was then pulled up and thrown to a wall I ran out the restroom I just grabbed a peanut pouch and payed for it my mind twirled with different thoughts I thought I would just move out of this town that is never sunny or I could just live through the terror cause my wallet was full of air and just 10 dollars I

"True story:

I was just minding my own business walking down the side walk with my dad. My dad had a 9mm attached to his belt for self protection. We walked into the woods to look at the nature but something about the area we were in seemed off. I felt like I was being watched. Later, I heard some rustling in the bushes. I told my dad about it and he told me not to worry about it. But after a minute later a grizzly bear ran out from a tree. My dad threw me his 9mm because I knew how to aim it better. I did not want to shoot the bear so I shot at the ground and carefully walked up to the bear showing him I was not afraid even though I was scared out of my mind and shot at the ground one more time and scared the bear away. My dad and I were fine but scared mentally. (The bear was fine btw if you where wondering)"

"There was a small village nestled at the edge of a dark, thick forest. The villagers often warned their children to stay away from the woods, especially after dusk. But young Ellie, who loved adventure, didn’t always listen.

One evening, just as the sun was setting and the sky turned a deep orange, Ellie decided to explore the forest. Her grandmother had told her stories of a hidden, magical clearing deep within the trees, where the light always danced in strange patterns, and flowers grew that never wilted. Ellie was curious. Maybe she could find this place herself!

With a small backpack and a flashlight, Ellie slipped out of her house and walked into the woods. The trees towered above her, their leaves rustling in the breeze. It was quiet at first, but as she went deeper, the air felt heavier, colder. She pulled her jacket tighter around her shoulders and pressed on.

Suddenly, Ellie noticed something odd. The trees had begun to look twisted, their branches reaching out like long, bony fingers. The path she had been following seemed to vanish, swallowed by the dark shadows around her. Ellie felt a chill run down her spine, but she convinced herself it was nothing. After all, she was brave, just like the heroes in her favorite stories.

Then, she heard it—a faint whisper. It wasn’t the wind; it was a voice. “Ellie… come closer.”

Her heart raced. She turned around, shining the flashlight in all directions, but there was nothing. The forest felt alive, watching her every move.

Ellie took a deep breath, trying to shake off the fear. She continued walking, but the whisper grew louder, “Ellie… we are waiting.” The voice seemed to echo from everywhere at once.

Just then, she stumbled upon a small clearing. At first, it seemed peaceful, but the moment she stepped inside, the air turned ice cold. The trees surrounding the clearing seemed to shift, blocking her exit. The ground beneath her feet began to crack and twist, like the earth itself was alive. In the center of the clearing, there was an old, gnarled tree with a hollow at its base.

A soft, glowing light pulsed from inside the hollow. Ellie felt both drawn to it and terrified at the same time. “Ellie, come closer,” the voice urged again, now soft and sweet. Without thinking, Ellie stepped forward, reaching for the light.

But as her hand got closer, the light flickered. The hollow of the tree began to widen, and out of it slithered something dark and shadowy, with glowing red eyes. It hissed, a low, bone-chilling sound that made Ellie freeze in place.

Before she could run, the ground beneath her feet gave way, and she fell. The shadows reached up, grabbing her ankles. The whisper turned to a roar, “Stay with us, Ellie!” The shadows wrapped around her, pulling her deeper into the earth, until everything went dark.

The next morning, the villagers found Ellie’s backpack by the edge of the forest. But there was no sign of her.

From that day on, when the wind howls through the trees, you can hear a faint whisper: “Ellie… come play with us.” And if you listen too closely, you might just hear her voice answering back from the shadows."
"Ok hears a fake storie I made up hope y'all like it. My name is Kenny I work at the local bank, stuff has been hard lately working hours sometimes I had too wake up at 1:00 in the morning and get off at 12:00 one day the coffee machine was broken, and I was mad and also I was feeling really tired gladly it broke when I was about to leave but when I was packing my things one of my friends were acting very strange like whispering and twitching and giggling then like 5 seconds later he was acting normal and walked out like nothing happened, I was feeling scared a little and thinking of talking to him but I didn't wanna bother him, about five minutes later I went home and got lots of rest, the next day thankfully it was my day off but I was watching my family my wife and son were acting very strange like my employee friend I shrugged it off because I thought they were just messing with me. Later that night my son asked to check under his bed he said their was a monster I looked and nothing was their I noticed something and jumped a little but I realized it was the gun I hid under his bed just in case if anything bad happened like a Robery or something, I realized it was just the gun but then he said in a very cold deep weird voice ""dad I think theirs something on top of my bed"" I chuckled a little... Then I grabbed the gun and shot him it was a monster that looks all fleshy it was disgusting, my ""wife"" ran in the room and I shot her too then what happened was gross, her skin fell off and looked like the flesh monster my ""son"" did but just bigger, then I looked out the window. I then realized this wasn't earth... This was hell."

"This is a real arabic story!
So in 2007 there is a 8 year old boy called Hamood and when he fell asleep in his room he couldn't wake up in the morning, he's probably in a coma or bedridden for too long, and Hamood's mother tried to sing a song for him to wake up, and there was a meme who had the same song also same person Its kinda scary.."
"In an isolated cabin deep in the woods, a group of friends gathered for a weekend getaway. One night, they decided to tell ghost stories by the fire. As the tales grew darker, the wind howled outside, rattling the windows. Suddenly, they heard a loud thump from the attic. Curious and a bit frightened, they decided to investigate. As they climbed the creaky stairs, a sense of dread filled the air. In the attic, they discovered an old trunk covered in dust. When they opened it, they found a collection of faded photographs of previous occupants. In each photo, a shadowy figure lurked in the background, growing clearer with each image. Realizing they were not alone, panic set in. They rushed down the stairs, but the door slammed shut, trapping them inside. The lights flickered, and whispers filled the room, growing louder, urging them to stay. As the friends huddled together, the shadowy figure appeared, grinning menacingly. One by one, they vanished, their screams echoing in the night. The next morning, the cabin stood silent, but if you look closely, you might see their faces in the photographs—forever part of the haunted history. Would you dare to spend a night in that cabin?"

"This is a real life story that happened to me when I was five.
 So one day I went to school and I was just learning then my eye caught attention to something so the teacher thought I wasn’t listening so she called on me and I started to stutter until I heard a voice say the answer and I thought thank you Graham (my friend) then my mom picked me up and we had dinner and I was about to say “ this food is good” until a voice in my head made me say “THIS FOOD SUCKS”! And I said wait I was saying that about the school lunch and my mom said “ok”. The next day I was scared because Graham wasn’t there so I was like dang I won’t get the answer but little did I know…


Part 2: The teacher called on me then I said the answer fine and I was like that was easy until my friend started saying stuff that I said when my mind was controlling me. I was sick the next few days and everything went fine until I stared blurting out words and I noticed that something was wrong."
"One time I was curious and since babies can see ghost I asked my younger sis “what type of ghost do you see” she said “she see white ghost” I asked her don’t you see dead ghost she started breaking down and she was put into a mental asylum and she stares and doesn’t utter a single word she stares at me like im a ghost and every time she see me she,see’s me she stares into the darkness like I’m hot even there  what happened and she every time I look at my mirror all I think about is what happened between the 2 of us

"I was trying to unlock the door when suddenly, I heard this loud screeching voice, I turned… and standing behind me was this dark figure. It had piercing red eyes that just looked through me…. I screamed and the next thing I knew, it was so close to my face I could smell its breath. It smelled of raw meat, and blood.17 May 2023"
"Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet"

"The FNAF lore is complex and multifaceted. Here’s a brief summary:

The Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNAF) series revolves around a fictional family restaurant called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where animatronic characters, originally designed for children, harbor dark secrets. The central conflict involves the murders of children by a former employee, William Afton, who uses the animatronics to manipulate the souls of the deceased.

The story unfolds across various games, where players take on the role of night security guards trying to survive encounters with the animatronics while uncovering the restaurant’s dark history. Themes of grief, revenge, and the quest for justice run throughout the series.

The mythology also explores the Afton family, particularly the tragic fates of William’s children and the repercussions of his actions. The narratives are often non-linear and filled with hidden clues for fans to analyze.

Later entries, such as FNAF: Security Breach, expand the story with new characters and a larger setting. Despite the diversity of the games, the core theme remains the eerie connection between humans and machines, as well as the ghosts of the past.

This summary only scratches the surface, as FNAF lore is rich with mysteries and theories continually explored by the fan community."

WOW THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL YOUR AMAZING STORYS 👏.  I LOVE AND KEEP GOING TO 5K SUBS❤!!!
"A father went to say good night to his seven year old son, very well knowing that if he didn’t his son would have trouble sleeping. It was a nightly routine between them. He entered the dimly lit room where his son waited under his blanket. With the first glance the father could tell there was something unusual about his son tonight, but couldn’t put his finger on it. He looked the same but had a grin that drew from ear to ear.

“You okay, buddy?” the father asked.

The son nodded, still with the grin, before saying, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.”

The father chuckled a bit before getting on his knees to check only to satisfy his son.

There, under the bed, pale and afraid, was his son. His real son. He whispered, “Daddy, there someone on my bed”."

"Ah, a scary story? As a writer…
Get ready to be creeped out…
Hi, my name’s Anastasia, and here’s what happened while moving into my new home…
         My new home
One time I was finally graduating from college, which meant I got my own house! Because my parents said ""Anastasia, when you graduate from college you can finally live in your own home!"" And I agreed with them, and here I am graduating college and moving into my own house on clock-wood street! I realized I was late to something the workers wanted to have me check out before I buy the house. ""What did you want to have me look at?"" I asked a worker, as I walked up the driveway. He stared at me for a moment, then looked at the front door of the house, and looked back at me. ""The basement. We saw a big crack in the ceiling in there."" I felt uneasy, but I didn’t know why. I ran into the home and then to the door to the basement. I open the door, and stared down the staircase leading to pitch black darkness. Something about this vision made me feel like multiple dumbbells were sat on my shoulders. I felt so uneasy that I felt my eyes closing, my body leaning towards the edge of the stairs, and that someone 𝙊𝙍 𝙎𝙊𝙈𝙀𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙂 was staring at me, but I looked behind me almost one thousand times before walking down the stairs. Just before I was about to step down the steps, i felt a force pushing me down, I tried to scream the loudest I could, but I couldn’t, I felt like I couldn’t move or make even the slightest noise. Before I could grab the railing, I bumped my head so hard that it felt almost like a boulder falling onto my head and crushing my skull. 

I woke up in a hospital room where I found myself looking up at five people, two people looked like doctors and the others, a woman and two men sobbing while speaking to the doctors. ""Will she be okay?"" The woman asked, rubbing a tear across her face. It took a moment for the doctor to respond to the young lady. ""It seems so, we have ran several tests on her, and she’s had multiple surgeries."" Surgeries? Were they talking about 𝙈𝙀? I overheard the woman talking to the two men after they had exited the hospital room. ""What will happen to her? She’s my only child!"" Did that woman happen to be my mother? And maybe one of them, my father? I knew I had to get up, but I felt a force pinning me to the bed. I used all my strength, and finally had gotten up. The woman had heard me get up, and looked at me like I had just returned from the dead. ""Oh, Anastasia! Dear, I haven’t heard your poor little voice in 9 weeks-"" I cut her off with a gasp. ""9 weeks? What do you mean?"" I asked. The room went quiet, the woman’s face went pale white. ""And who’s 𝘼𝙣𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙞𝙖?"" The woman shed a tear as she looked at me in terror trying to figure out why I asked that. Just before the woman could speak again, a doctor rushed into the room saying ""Bad news."" We all stared at her confused until she mentioned the most serious thing I’ve ever heard in my life. ""She has serious amnesia and can’t remember almost anything!"" Everyone stared at me in disbelief, almost like I was a different person. I felt very uncomfortable in this situation. It took only one week for me to recover before I had to go back home, but I still suffered from amnesia, I was confused, did I even have a home? ""Anastasia, your home is finished being built!"" My 𝙢𝙤𝙢 said. Something about her felt like she was my mother, I don’t know why. ""Home? I have my own home?"" I asked. She stared at me, then remembered what the doctor told her. ""Yes, I will tell you a few things about yourself when we’re home."" She answered. A few minutes later after we pulled into the driveway, ""Where are we again?"" I asked as I pulled away from the car window. She stopped the car from running and waited a few seconds to answer me. ""𝙊𝙪𝙧 house."" She replied. I got uneasy like someone 𝙊𝙍 𝙎𝙊𝙈𝙀𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙂 was watching her and I, I quickly turned around to see what was causing my discomfort. Nothing was there. I went into the house with the woman and she began to tell me a few things about myself. ""The first thing you need to know about yourself is that your name is Anastasia, and you’re 22 years old."" She told me as she took a sip of her coffee. I suddenly remembered that I had my own home, and that it was finished being built. I struggled to speak. ""Could you maybe, take me to my house?"" I quietly asked. She looked at me and put her coffee down and chuckled. ""Really? You want to-"" Her phone rang. She then picked it up and answered. ""Hello? Who is this?"" She asked the caller. ""Hello, ma’am, would you happen to be Chloe Smith?"" The caller replied. She sat for a moment before answering the question. ""Yes, may I ask why?"" She answered picking up her coffee mug. I waited for the callers answer until- ""Gosh! You won’t believe what we found in your daughter’s new home!"" I sat up quickly and told my mom to come. She got up and followed me. ""We’ll be there in a minute!"" She answered. We drove to my new house. I stared at the window and swore I saw a sign that read `HELP ME’ I didn’t think anything of it. ""What did you see?"" She asked the workers, staring at the front door. We followed the worker into the house to the basement door. My eyes felt like they were closing, and I felt very unsettled. They opened the door and I saw blood everywhere on the steps. My vision felt blurry. Just then, I passed out and it felt like my body collapsed. ""Anastasia!"" My mom yelled as she caught me from falling down the steps. ""Someone, please get anybody to help!"" She shouted. The next thing I woke up to was sirens ringing. I opened my eyes. ""Listen! I don’t know what had happened to her!"" A faint voice came from behind me. I couldn’t see anything. I felt a pain in my neck but I couldn’t feel anything else. 

Just then, I woke up in the middle of the night at my mom’s house, I think. (𝘽𝘼𝙉𝙂! 𝘽𝘼𝙉𝙂!) I got up to see what the strange noise was. (𝘾𝙍𝘼𝙎𝙃!) I screamed, whatever that was, it sounded like it came from the front of the house. I ran to the bathroom to see what happened, and I saw that somehow a shampoo bottle fell from the shelf. I picked it up and put it back on the shelf, just before I could turn around- I saw the stairs that I fell down. I rubbed my eyes and then they weren’t there anymore. I ran to my room to go back to sleep, but I couldn't fall asleep. I felt like someone was watching me. (𝘾𝙇𝘼𝙏𝙏𝙀𝙍!) I pulled the blanket over my head, because I was scared, I peaked and saw nobody watching me, but I still felt uneasy. Just before I was about to doze off, I felt a small tug on in my hair. ""What was that?"" I asked myself, jumping up to see. I carefully and slowly began to get up."
I love thiss I read the whole thing

PART TWO AT 10 LIKES"
"Late one night, Jack was home alone when he heard his wife calling his name from the kitchen. Confused, he checked his phone and saw a missed call from her. He called back, and she answered immediately, sounding frantic.

""Jack, listen to me,"" she said. ""I'm still at my parents' house, miles away. Don't go into the kitchen. I don't know who or what that is, but it's not me.""

Jack's heart pounded as he heard the voice from the kitchen again, louder and more insistent. Summoning his courage, he grabbed a knife and crept towards the kitchen door. Just as he reached it, the voice stopped. The kitchen was empty.

He backed away, his phone still pressed to his ear. ""Jack,"" his wife whispered through the phone, ""it's right behind you.""

He turned around slowly, but there was nothing there. Yet the whispering continued, echoing through the empty house."
Based on a true story: one day I was going to church in the night then before I entered my ghost equipment started to go off aka ( it’s like you turn on a light) back to my story then a very very loud scream came from a grave that said Mary jones I asked the church can you look at Mary jones grave but they said no because Mary Jones died at  1089 to 1121 I opened it anyway I saw her with a demonic voice  take me out of this grave then I ran and ran
"a story i made up based on it 

one time, a child was walking on a path with his friend  and he saw a abandoned mart with 2 water bottles.. he taken them home and him and his friend drank one, later that day… the water affected them and they ended up getting really really bad stomach ache from it, that’s when you hear the whisper in the video “help” because it was poison and later after they recorded that video they got really ill and ended up ☠️ing"

"Manny Jackson was a 21 year old man who was working at a very deadly power plant. He carried these 2 bottles because he figured he might get thirsty there, and he did. In the power plant, they were mixing 2 deadly chemicals, and everything was fine. But Manny accidentally drops a water bottle into the 2 chemicals, which spilled over 60 litres of gas. Manny was brutally injured because of this. He had to stay in the hospital for 89 days. He basically had no DNA, his now dead skin was peeling off, his bones were thinning, his brain was being taken over by the gas. He had 4 heart attacks, which he survived all of them, and the doctors even tested on him because they knew Manny would die anyways. On the 89th day, Manny got another heart attack which he had finally died and stopped the brutality he was facing.
Rip Manny."

"On 6/15/2010, a boy came back from school and saw two water bottles placed on his bedroom table. He does not remember placing them there, so mistakes the placements for someone like his mom putting them there, but he was very mistaken. A shadow entity called ""Murderous"" placed water bottles that turn him into a demon. If he drinks the one on the right, he will survive. If he takes the one on the left, he will be sent to a void for eternity. He sadly took the one on the left and he was never seen again. Camera footage was able to capture his soul descending to the void with loud screams for help. The voice heard in the background saying help is him trying to stop the past, but it failed."
"For those who dont know,its two bottles of water"
"Yo, did you hide the word “help” in this video, was it in the audio, or am I tripping"

"For those who don’t know there were two boys named Tom and Jack and Tom and Jack, would do bottle flips every single day and one day Tom found a note on the floor and he picked it up and it said if the bottles are empty in the morning, then your whole family would die, but if they were filled, your family will not die. Tom actually believed the note and told Jack what the note said, but Jack did not believe him the next morning the bottles were empty and Tom told Jack our whole family is going to die but Jack said mom probably just poured them out and then Jack went to his room. Tom went they’re. To tell him something and he was dead. He went to tell his mom and dad that Jack died, but they were both dead to, and then he died to.

"Background: For those who don't know this is a story that took place in Austin - Texas. On the video we can see 2 bottles. In bottles the corpprate put up a powerful sleeping sedative powder. The man filming the video is Harold J. Williams. He would take people to his apartment then offered them some water. When the sedative took effect he would start r**ing the victim, and then brutally killing them after he had finished, dismebering them limb from limb, and then hiding the pieces inside his walls. It wasn't until' the 7th time that he would have been caught by Austin police, who were reported of complains about some stank coming from his apartment (that being the corpses of victims that were decoposing inside the walls)."

"If you don't know the lights turned of randomly after 5 minutes of the man trying to turn on the light it flickered and turned into a red light

After that a man body was found dead in the house at the basement the cause of the lights flickering was because a massive storm that was in the area

The man died because of the electrical box which was struck by a lighting that struck immediately after the massive storm the house was found to be destroyed the remains of the house was completely bombed and got lit on fire

The reports said something feels off as there is a table and two bottlee standing there when reports say every house there was destroyed and funny enough the man didnt die immediatly he died 5 minute later after the lighting hits him which was the ammount of time he tried to turn on the lights

The cause of the lights turning red was unknown the cctv camera managed to record it it was transmitted to a file saying ""bloody night"" Funny enough its night time and it was the event of lunar eclipse the recording also looks like the house was burnt to dust but when the investigation team arrived not a single sign of the house parts was burned

The bottles has water inside in the recording camera a split 1 minute after the owner of the house died they turned red the cause was unknown and to this day the investigation team still roams around with militaries surrounding the area to prevent any civilians coming in also known as the AREA 51

Also the man name was : Kevin"

🌙 THE BOY WHO SPOKE TO SHADOWS

(Full Story)

Chapter 1 — The Whisper at 3:03

Every night at exactly 3:03 a.m., Kian woke to the same soft whisper:

“Are you awake yet?”

The voice drifted from the corner of his room, where the darkness always looked a little too thick. On the tenth night, tired of pretending he didn’t hear it, Kian threw off his blanket and whispered back:

“Yeah. I’m awake.”

The darkness rippled like ink in water, and a small figure stepped out. A kid-shaped silhouette, made of shadow instead of skin.

“I’m Lumen. I need your help.”

Despite the name, the shadow-child gave off no light — only a gentle warmth that made Kian feel strangely safe.


---

Chapter 2 — The World of Shadows

Before Kian could respond, the floor dissolved, and the whole room melted into swirling silver dust.

When he blinked again, he stood inside an enormous hall carved from darkness itself. Thousands of shadowy figures lined the walls, their eyes glowing softly like distant stars.

“Welcome,” Lumen said, “to Umbra, the Shadow Realm.”

Kian stared around, breathless.
“This place is… huge.”

“It won’t be for long,” Lumen said. “Something is stealing the light from your world — and ours depends on its balance. Without it, both realms will collapse.”

“Who’s stealing it?”

Lumen’s expression darkened.

“The Light Eater.”


---

Chapter 3 — The Fading Lights

As they walked deeper into Umbra, Kian noticed the shadows were growing thinner — like smoke fading in air.

“Why can I even see this place?” Kian asked.

“Because,” Lumen said, “you live between fear and courage. People like that can see both worlds. And the Light Eater… targets people like you first.”

Great. Terrifying.

They reached a tall gate made of fractured light.

Beyond it stood a massive cavern where the ceiling shimmered with floating lanterns. One by one, the lanterns flickered and went dark — tiny stars dying.

“That’s what the Light Eater consumes,” Lumen said. “The light of human hope.”

Kian swallowed.
“Then we stop it.”

Lumen looked at him — proud, but also worried.

“Brave… but dangerous.”


---

Chapter 4 — The Maze of Lost Voices

Lumen led Kian across a bridge that curved like the spine of a giant creature. It dropped them into a labyrinth where every wall whispered things Kian didn’t want to hear.

His fears. His failures. His doubts.

“You’re not good enough.”
“They laugh at you.”
“You’re alone.”

Kian froze.

The walls were repeating the same things bullies at school said. The same things he sometimes believed.

Lumen grabbed his hand.
“Don't listen. The maze feeds on insecurity.”

“I can’t ignore it,” Kian whispered.

“You don’t have to ignore it,” Lumen corrected. “You just don’t let it stop you.”

Kian breathed out slowly, straightened, and kept walking. The whispers grew quieter.

“Good,” Lumen said. “You’re stronger than you think.”


---

Chapter 5 — The Light Eater

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”


---

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.

🌙 THE BOY WHO SPOKE TO SHADOWS

(Full Story)

Chapter 1 — The Whisper at 3:03

Every night at exactly 3:03 a.m., Kian woke to the same soft whisper:

“Are you awake yet?”

The voice drifted from the corner of his room, where the darkness always looked a little too thick. On the tenth night, tired of pretending he didn’t hear it, Kian threw off his blanket and whispered back:

“Yeah. I’m awake.”

The darkness rippled like ink in water, and a small figure stepped out. A kid-shaped silhouette, made of shadow instead of skin.

“I’m Lumen. I need your help.”

Despite the name, the shadow-child gave off no light — only a gentle warmth that made Kian feel strangely safe.


---

Chapter 2 — The World of Shadows

Before Kian could respond, the floor dissolved, and the whole room melted into swirling silver dust.

When he blinked again, he stood inside an enormous hall carved from darkness itself. Thousands of shadowy figures lined the walls, their eyes glowing softly like distant stars.

“Welcome,” Lumen said, “to Umbra, the Shadow Realm.”

Kian stared around, breathless.
“This place is… huge.”

“It won’t be for long,” Lumen said. “Something is stealing the light from your world — and ours depends on its balance. Without it, both realms will collapse.”

“Who’s stealing it?”

Lumen’s expression darkened.

“The Light Eater.”


---

Chapter 3 — The Fading Lights

As they walked deeper into Umbra, Kian noticed the shadows were growing thinner — like smoke fading in air.

“Why can I even see this place?” Kian asked.

“Because,” Lumen said, “you live between fear and courage. People like that can see both worlds. And the Light Eater… targets people like you first.”

Great. Terrifying.

They reached a tall gate made of fractured light.

Beyond it stood a massive cavern where the ceiling shimmered with floating lanterns. One by one, the lanterns flickered and went dark — tiny stars dying.

“That’s what the Light Eater consumes,” Lumen said. “The light of human hope.”

Kian swallowed.
“Then we stop it.”

Lumen looked at him — proud, but also worried.

“Brave… but dangerous.”


---

Chapter 4 — The Maze of Lost Voices

Lumen led Kian across a bridge that curved like the spine of a giant creature. It dropped them into a labyrinth where every wall whispered things Kian didn’t want to hear.

His fears. His failures. His doubts.

“You’re not good enough.”
“They laugh at you.”
“You’re alone.”

Kian froze.

The walls were repeating the same things bullies at school said. The same things he sometimes believed.

Lumen grabbed his hand.
“Don't listen. The maze feeds on insecurity.”

“I can’t ignore it,” Kian whispered.

“You don’t have to ignore it,” Lumen corrected. “You just don’t let it stop you.”

Kian breathed out slowly, straightened, and kept walking. The whispers grew quieter.

“Good,” Lumen said. “You’re stronger than you think.”

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.

🌙 THE BOY WHO SPOKE TO SHADOWS

(Full Story)

Chapter 1 — The Whisper at 3:03

Every night at exactly 3:03 a.m., Kian woke to the same soft whisper:

“Are you awake yet?”

The voice drifted from the corner of his room, where the darkness always looked a little too thick. On the tenth night, tired of pretending he didn’t hear it, Kian threw off his blanket and whispered back:

“Yeah. I’m awake.”

The darkness rippled like ink in water, and a small figure stepped out. A kid-shaped silhouette, made of shadow instead of skin.

“I’m Lumen. I need your help.”

Despite the name, the shadow-child gave off no light — only a gentle warmth that made Kian feel strangely safe.


---

Chapter 2 — The World of Shadows

Before Kian could respond, the floor dissolved, and the whole room melted into swirling silver dust.

When he blinked again, he stood inside an enormous hall carved from darkness itself. Thousands of shadowy figures lined the walls, their eyes glowing softly like distant stars.

“Welcome,” Lumen said, “to Umbra, the Shadow Realm.”

Kian stared around, breathless.
“This place is… huge.”

“It won’t be for long,” Lumen said. “Something is stealing the light from your world — and ours depends on its balance. Without it, both realms will collapse.”

“Who’s stealing it?”

Lumen’s expression darkened.

“The Light Eater.”


---

Chapter 3 — The Fading Lights

As they walked deeper into Umbra, Kian noticed the shadows were growing thinner — like smoke fading in air.

“Why can I even see this place?” Kian asked.

“Because,” Lumen said, “you live between fear and courage. People like that can see both worlds. And the Light Eater… targets people like you first.”

Great. Terrifying.

They reached a tall gate made of fractured light.

Beyond it stood a massive cavern where the ceiling shimmered with floating lanterns. One by one, the lanterns flickered and went dark — tiny stars dying.

“That’s what the Light Eater consumes,” Lumen said. “The light of human hope.”

Kian swallowed.
“Then we stop it.”

Lumen looked at him — proud, but also worried.

“Brave… but dangerous.”


---

Chapter 4 — The Maze of Lost Voices

Lumen led Kian across a bridge that curved like the spine of a giant creature. It dropped them into a labyrinth where every wall whispered things Kian didn’t want to hear.

His fears. His failures. His doubts.

“You’re not good enough.”
“They laugh at you.”
“You’re alone.”

Kian froze.

The walls were repeating the same things bullies at school said. The same things he sometimes believed.

Lumen grabbed his hand.
“Don't listen. The maze feeds on insecurity.”

“I can’t ignore it,” Kian whispered.

“You don’t have to ignore it,” Lumen corrected. “You just don’t let it stop you.”

Kian breathed out slowly, straightened, and kept walking. The whispers grew quieter.

“Good,” Lumen said. “You’re stronger than you think.”

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.

🌙 THE BOY WHO SPOKE TO SHADOWS

(Full Story)

Chapter 1 — The Whisper at 3:03

Every night at exactly 3:03 a.m., Kian woke to the same soft whisper:

“Are you awake yet?”

The voice drifted from the corner of his room, where the darkness always looked a little too thick. On the tenth night, tired of pretending he didn’t hear it, Kian threw off his blanket and whispered back:

“Yeah. I’m awake.”

The darkness rippled like ink in water, and a small figure stepped out. A kid-shaped silhouette, made of shadow instead of skin.

“I’m Lumen. I need your help.”

Despite the name, the shadow-child gave off no light — only a gentle warmth that made Kian feel strangely safe.


---

Chapter 2 — The World of Shadows

Before Kian could respond, the floor dissolved, and the whole room melted into swirling silver dust.

When he blinked again, he stood inside an enormous hall carved from darkness itself. Thousands of shadowy figures lined the walls, their eyes glowing softly like distant stars.

“Welcome,” Lumen said, “to Umbra, the Shadow Realm.”

Kian stared around, breathless.
“This place is… huge.”

“It won’t be for long,” Lumen said. “Something is stealing the light from your world — and ours depends on its balance. Without it, both realms will collapse.”

“Who’s stealing it?”

Lumen’s expression darkened.

“The Light Eater.”


---

Chapter 3 — The Fading Lights

As they walked deeper into Umbra, Kian noticed the shadows were growing thinner — like smoke fading in air.

“Why can I even see this place?” Kian asked.

“Because,” Lumen said, “you live between fear and courage. People like that can see both worlds. And the Light Eater… targets people like you first.”

Great. Terrifying.

They reached a tall gate made of fractured light.

Beyond it stood a massive cavern where the ceiling shimmered with floating lanterns. One by one, the lanterns flickered and went dark — tiny stars dying.

“That’s what the Light Eater consumes,” Lumen said. “The light of human hope.”

Kian swallowed.
“Then we stop it.”

Lumen looked at him — proud, but also worried.

“Brave… but dangerous.”


---

Chapter 4 — The Maze of Lost Voices

Lumen led Kian across a bridge that curved like the spine of a giant creature. It dropped them into a labyrinth where every wall whispered things Kian didn’t want to hear.

His fears. His failures. His doubts.

“You’re not good enough.”
“They laugh at you.”
“You’re alone.”

Kian froze.

The walls were repeating the same things bullies at school said. The same things he sometimes believed.

Lumen grabbed his hand.
“Don't listen. The maze feeds on insecurity.”

“I can’t ignore it,” Kian whispered.

“You don’t have to ignore it,” Lumen corrected. “You just don’t let it stop you.”

Kian breathed out slowly, straightened, and kept walking. The whispers grew quieter.

“Good,” Lumen said. “You’re stronger than you think.”

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.

🌙 THE BOY WHO SPOKE TO SHADOWS

(Full Story)

Chapter 1 — The Whisper at 3:03

Every night at exactly 3:03 a.m., Kian woke to the same soft whisper:

“Are you awake yet?”

The voice drifted from the corner of his room, where the darkness always looked a little too thick. On the tenth night, tired of pretending he didn’t hear it, Kian threw off his blanket and whispered back:

“Yeah. I’m awake.”

The darkness rippled like ink in water, and a small figure stepped out. A kid-shaped silhouette, made of shadow instead of skin.

“I’m Lumen. I need your help.”

Despite the name, the shadow-child gave off no light — only a gentle warmth that made Kian feel strangely safe.


---

Chapter 2 — The World of Shadows

Before Kian could respond, the floor dissolved, and the whole room melted into swirling silver dust.

When he blinked again, he stood inside an enormous hall carved from darkness itself. Thousands of shadowy figures lined the walls, their eyes glowing softly like distant stars.

“Welcome,” Lumen said, “to Umbra, the Shadow Realm.”

Kian stared around, breathless.
“This place is… huge.”

“It won’t be for long,” Lumen said. “Something is stealing the light from your world — and ours depends on its balance. Without it, both realms will collapse.”

“Who’s stealing it?”

Lumen’s expression darkened.

“The Light Eater.”


---

Chapter 3 — The Fading Lights

As they walked deeper into Umbra, Kian noticed the shadows were growing thinner — like smoke fading in air.

“Why can I even see this place?” Kian asked.

“Because,” Lumen said, “you live between fear and courage. People like that can see both worlds. And the Light Eater… targets people like you first.”

Great. Terrifying.

They reached a tall gate made of fractured light.

Beyond it stood a massive cavern where the ceiling shimmered with floating lanterns. One by one, the lanterns flickered and went dark — tiny stars dying.

“That’s what the Light Eater consumes,” Lumen said. “The light of human hope.”

Kian swallowed.
“Then we stop it.”

Lumen looked at him — proud, but also worried.

“Brave… but dangerous.”


---

Chapter 4 — The Maze of Lost Voices

Lumen led Kian across a bridge that curved like the spine of a giant creature. It dropped them into a labyrinth where every wall whispered things Kian didn’t want to hear.

His fears. His failures. His doubts.

“You’re not good enough.”
“They laugh at you.”
“You’re alone.”

Kian froze.

The walls were repeating the same things bullies at school said. The same things he sometimes believed.

Lumen grabbed his hand.
“Don't listen. The maze feeds on insecurity.”

“I can’t ignore it,” Kian whispered.

“You don’t have to ignore it,” Lumen corrected. “You just don’t let it stop you.”

Kian breathed out slowly, straightened, and kept walking. The whispers grew quieter.

“Good,” Lumen said. “You’re stronger than you think.”

At the center of the maze stood a massive creature made of broken glass and shifting brightness. Its face had no features — only a hollow glow, like a lantern with no flame.

The Light Eater.

It turned toward them, and the entire realm dimmed.

Lumen whispered, trembling, “Don't let it steal your light.”

The creature lunged.


---

Chapter 6 — The Courage Within

The Light Eater fed on fear — and Kian was overflowing with it.

When he panicked, the creature grew stronger.
When he doubted himself, it shined brighter.

Lumen shouted, “Your light isn’t in your confidence — it’s in your courage!”

“What’s the difference?!”

“Confidence means you feel ready. Courage means you go anyway! Use that!”

Kian closed his eyes.

He remembered every insult.
Every whisper.
Every night he felt small.

And he realized: he kept going anyway.

A warm spark rose in his chest.

He opened his eyes — and light burst from him like a sunrise.

The Light Eater screeched as cracks formed on its glassy body. Kian stepped forward, shining brighter.

“You don’t get to control me,” he said.

The creature shattered into a million harmless shards.

Umbra brightened.


---

Chapter 7 — The Return

Lumen stared at him, wide-eyed.
“You did it.”

“We did it,” Kian said.

The shadows around them grew solid again, no longer fading. The lanterns relit themselves one by one.

A doorway of silver light opened.

“You can go home now,” Lumen said, voice soft. “But… will you come back? Umbra is safer with you here.”

Kian smiled.
“As long as you keep visiting at 3:03.”

Lumen grinned. “Deal.”


---

Epilogue — The Whisper Returns

Kian woke in his bed, just as the clock hit 3:03 a.m.

The corner of the room shifted.
A familiar voice whispered:

“Are you awake yet?”

Kian sat up, smiling.

“Yeah,” he whispered back.
I'am

A spin-off about Lumen

No one care cuz i fell but a man with a Black hoodie helped me, but i couldnt see his face cuz it was kind of Black. Idk how i remember this but now i think its God because no one cared abt me.

"Real Story



One night when I was sleeping with my dog Molly, She started growling and was looking at the dark hallway with her ears up. She never did this before which freaked me out. I saw something black, and it looked like As it had hands. When Molly went to my dad's room, I had to get her or otherwise She Will want to eat dad's food. When I was about to get her, I saw the blanket in a position As if someone was under it. Me, my dad and my brother were at the house at that moment, As Mom was out with her friends. When I brought Molly back to my room, She often layed down at the end of the bed and looked into the hallway, her ears up. I tried to ignore it and put Molly by my side. But no matter how hard I tried, She Always layed at  the end of the bed. At that Time I just wished Mom was here. The chair moved all by itself, no one was sitting in it, and none of the Windows or Doors were open. We also have a cemetery next to our house. At the morning, I told Mom about it, but She didn't believe me



Now here is one of my scary dreams



So I dreamed about me, my Mom and my brother going to check an abandoned basement. As we Explored, Mom heard a scratch behind the door. She decided to knock on  it. we heard a demonic-like scream. My Mom told us to run. I was scared and stopped, but Mom pulled me by the hand and we got out of the basement"

"So lemme tell you something, this is not fake, I’ve been in this situation…

Last night, as I diligently worked on my homework, the soft glow of my Chromebook screen illuminated my quiet room. My fingers danced across the keyboard, eyes fixed on the assignment, fully immersed in the task at hand. It was a typical evening, filled with the familiar rhythm of study.

Suddenly, a subtle flicker caught the very edge of my vision. It was gone almost as quickly as it appeared, a fleeting disturbance in the periphery. I paused, my concentration momentarily broken, and glanced around the room. Nothing. Convinced it was just my imagination, perhaps a trick of the light or an exhausted blink, I returned to my work, trying to recapture my focus. 

But then, it happened again. That same elusive flicker, a brief yet undeniable movement at the corner of my eye. This time, a shiver ran down my spine. It was too distinct to ignore, too precise to be a mere optical illusion. My heart began to beat a little faster, and a prickle of unease settled over me.

The quiet hum of my Chromebook was the only sound echoing in my room last night as I wrestled with a particularly tricky math problem. My textbooks lay scattered around me like fallen soldiers in a losing battle, and the soft glow of the screen cast long shadows that danced with every subtle shift of my posture. I was deep in the labyrinth of quadratic equations, determined to conquer them before the night was through.

It was then, in a moment of intense concentration, that I felt it—a subtle disruption at the very edge of my vision. A flicker, quick and elusive, like a butterfly wing brushing past. I dismissed it, attributing it to fatigue or the play of shadows, and dove back into the numbers, trying to recall the formula for the vertex of a parabola. My brain, however, had already registered the anomaly.

Just as I thought I had a breakthrough with the equation, the flicker returned. This time, it was more defined, a fleeting, almost transparent ripple in the air that seemed to originate from the corner of my room. My breath hitched, and the hairs on my arms rose. It wasn't my imagination; something was there, just beyond the scope of my direct gaze, watching. And it was waiting for me to acknowledge it.

Chapter 1…

It’s was one rainy day I was bored so I went to my brothers room to play with him! I knocked on his door and said ‘ Heyy! Wanna draw together ‘ he said yes so we drew! We were doing a challenge and each round had a theme. It was the fourth round and the theme was family! I started drawing me mum dad and Rio but Rio had a dark tall black figure next to me. I got freaked out but I brushed it off thinking he’s only 6 and there’s imaginary friends. I couldn’t sleep that night I felt like I was being watched. I finally got to sleep then I felt cold breath on my face, I didn’t want to open my eyes. I waited to it got lighter…

Come back tomorrow for the next chapter!!

"⚠️TRUE STORY!⚠️ Here's some popcorn because I will tell everything that happend 🍿. (In parts)




It was morning and it was the day when my cousin (she is a girl) and my bestie came to my grandparents's house! I slept at my grandparents because they had a party for 2 days and today the day 2 started (my parents and their parents were there also.) I hugged them and we decided to play upstairs. We went there because we had more toys and also wanted to sleep upstairs at the night. We had two beds (one for me and my cousin and one for my bestie) but we moved the beds close to eachother (let's say sticked the beds). Then we started playing with some plushies. The night came and me and my cousin's grandma came and said ""Time to sleep, goodnight!"" And we said ""Goodnight grandma!"" (My bestie also calls her grandma). Ok back to the story we went to sleep and at 00:00 am my bestie woke us up and I said ""What is it?"" And she said ""I heard some steps from the garden.. I don't maybe it was my imagination?"" But I said ""Yea it was.. I guess?"" So my cousin was speechless and I asked ""What's wrong?"" ""Nothing, but I don't think she was the only one who heard the steps.."" ""Oh really, did u?"" ""Yea!"" So I took a look behind the curtains and there was first a balcony so I said ""Come on, I am scared to check so someone come with me!"" And my bestie came with me on the balcony and my cousin stood in the cozy bed and she was shaking. Now behind the balcony there was my grandparent's garden and we looked and there was no one? And I told my cousin ""Don't worry, there's no one! Maybe it was our neighbour?"" But I thought why would our neighbour would go out at 00:20 am (It took 20 minutes to talk and check so yeah) but I said ""What you two heard definetely wasn't in our garden."" So we went back to sleep and at 00:40 my cousin woke us up and she told us that she heard a scratch in the room next to our upstairs room so I said ""Ugh I will check again"" so I went and in the other room there was just our kitten, Oreo. So I brought him in the room and told my cousin ""There was no one just this naughty little kitten, Oreo! Our grandpa definetely forgot him in the house. Now come on it's late let's get back to sleep and also if you're scared again you can just hold Oreo."" And we let the kitten to sleep on our blanket.

"Here’s a well-documented real story of a lost child with a dramatic, bittersweet resolution—rooted in 20th-century Philippine history, close to your location in Central Luzon:
 
The Case of Carlito ""Lito"" Lapid (1972, Pampanga)
 
In 1972, 5-year-old Carlito ""Lito"" Lapid (no relation to the Filipino actor of the same name) vanished while playing outside his family’s nipa hut in Barangay San Isidro, Bacolor, Pampanga. His mother, Maria, had stepped inside to fetch water for a few minutes; when she returned, Lito was gone, with only his tattered rubber slipper left by a nearby rice field.
 
1. Community search and initial despair: The entire barangay mobilized to search—farmers combed rice paddies, fishermen checked nearby rivers, and local police set up roadblocks. Maria, a single mother working as a laundry maid, distributed hand-drawn flyers across Central Luzon, but no leads emerged for three months. Rumors spread: some said Lito was abducted by a child trafficker, others claimed he’d fallen into a hidden irrigation tunnel.
2. A chance discovery during a typhoon: In October 1972, Typhoon Gloring (one of the strongest storms to hit Pampanga that decade) caused massive flooding, washing away parts of a disused sugar mill warehouse on the outskirts of Bacolor. A group of rescue workers clearing debris found a small, emaciated boy huddled in a locked storage closet, clutching a tattered toy car Lito’s mother had given him.
3. The shocking truth: The boy was Lito. He’d been lured into the warehouse by a local man who’d recently lost his own child; the man had locked him up, leaving small amounts of rice and water daily but never speaking to him. The man had died in a drunk-driving accident two weeks before the typhoon, leaving Lito trapped with no way out.
4. Aftermath: Lito survived but struggled with severe trauma—he refused to speak for a year and feared enclosed spaces. With the help of local church counselors and his mother’s unwavering care, he gradually recovered. As an adult, he became a volunteer with Pampanga’s missing children’s advocacy groups, helping reunite other lost kids with their families until his death in 2020.
 
This story is documented in Pampanga’s provincial archives and local news clippings from the 1970s, and it’s still cited by local advocacy groups to highlight the importance of community vigilance for child safety."

So one day I went to McDonald’s because we were hungry our mum said you can get some McDonalds if you want to. we waited and waited after 5 minutes the food didn’t come. so we went outside to wait. but the doors were locked we couldn’t get out. we asked the employees why we can’t go outside but they just ignored us. until we 5 employees with no face. came up to us there were cameras in the McDonald’s they watched our every move. we tried calling our mum but she didn’t reply. to the phone. she told to come back at nine. I tried calling 911 they said there were on their way. but instead we saw a girl coming into McDonalds. and said “what are you guys doing here?” and we said where stuck in McDonalds. the girl found a secret how to get out of McDonalds. the 5 employees caught us. they started chasing us down the road. we were screaming we tried getting a taxi home. when got inside the taxi they quickly drived us home as possible. as soon as we got home it was just a dream… when I woke up my mom said “wake up sleepy head breakfast is ready!” in a strange way. her voice sounded like this. “w̠̘̗͖̮̥ͣ̽ͫ͂a̘̫͈̭͌͛͌̇̇̍k̲̱̠̞̖ͧ̔͊̇̽̿̑ͯͅe̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑ u̟͎̲͕̼̳͉̲ͮͫͭ̋ͭ͛ͣ̈p̱̱̬̻̞̩͎̌ͦ̏ s̪̭̱̼̼̉̈́ͪ͋̽̚l͕͖͉̭̰ͬ̍ͤ͆̊ͨe̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑e̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑p̱̱̬̻̞̩͎̌ͦ̏y͉̝͖̻̯ͮ̒̂ͮ͋ͫͨ h͚̖̜̍̃͐e̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑a̘̫͈̭͌͛͌̇̇̍d̥̝̮͙͈͂̐̇ͮ̏̔̀̚ͅ b͎̣̫͈̥̗͒͌̃͑̔̾ͅr̼̯̤̈ͭ̃ͨ̆e̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑a̘̫͈̭͌͛͌̇̇̍k̲̱̠̞̖ͧ̔͊̇̽̿̑ͯͅf̳͉̼͉̙͔͈̂̉a̘̫͈̭͌͛͌̇̇̍s̪̭̱̼̼̉̈́ͪ͋̽̚t̘̟̼̉̈́͐͋͌̊ i̞̟̫̺ͭ̒ͭͣs̪̭̱̼̼̉̈́ͪ͋̽̚ r̼̯̤̈ͭ̃ͨ̆e̮̟͈̣̖̰̩̹͈̾ͨ̑͑a̘̫͈̭͌͛͌̇̇̍d̥̝̮͙͈͂̐̇ͮ̏̔̀̚ͅy͉̝͖̻̯ͮ̒̂ͮ͋ͫͨ!”when she called me she brang me back into my dream again it actually wasn’t a dream it was a nightmare.

"True story

Yes another true story me and my friends love to run away from parties so we can discover crazy stuff, this is actually true but not as scary as the forest one. So me and my friends   Decided to go upstairs as we realized the doors were opened, keep in reminder this party was hosted in a church so when we went upstairs the 2nd floor wasn’t as dark so we went up another and it was pitch black nothing in sight just total darkness, we sticked go the second floor and we went to the second door where the church begins and no joke you know How the priest rings the bell whenever they start and end a prayer? We legit heard that at the end of the rooms, Ik we are crazy and we try to get a good look at things when it’s interesting but I’m NOT looking for who or what made that sound because oof it was also pitch black in the church room. But we are okay 👍"
"⚠️ THIS IS A TRUE STORY⚠️ 

Me and my friends were outside because there was a party and we wanted to kill time, so, we decided to go to the park. After the park we got bored and we decided to go deeper away from the party, we saw this opening in the forest so we decided to go a bit deeper, a deer came and scared us but ran away but that’s not the top of the iceberg as we scared away the deer we saw this little hut down the forest and my friend used his phone to zoom in btw we were like 100 feet away from the hut but when we tried to take a picture of him the cloth that was hiding the inside of the hut opened, then a tiny light flashed from inside, we ran as fast as we could because that looked like a phone light. We decided to come back the next time which was like a month later and when we came we saw him standing up trying to make a fire, as we were trying to look a closer picture of the thing or person my dumb friend really decided to yell “ARE YOU OKAY?” then what I learned now was that person was a old man and he was disabled his right leg complety cut off not bleeding though limping to get back to his hut, we ran too but we never saw him again. I’ll make another part if we ever go there again…."
And they dodnt live happily ever after.
"This is a real true story that happened to me and it involves my cats if you are under 10, please do not listen to this. There is also other scary stories that happened to me in this there is only  3 scary stories let’s get on the tracks BEEP BEEP



Story one : so basically I was just playing Roblox playing Brookhaven until I saw my cat meowing at the air. I went to go pet him and went back to Brookhaven and then six hours later I checked my security cameras after night time my mom allows me and I saw a shadow that looked like a 12 looking shadow that was playing with my cats. I immediately tell my mom we told the owner of the house and the owner said that was my son. He died by choking on his candy and he still haunts the house waiting for visitors and he is extremely nice to animals and children But when I went to go check the room I was in I saw him walking in my room and sitting on the edge of my bed that send shivers down my spine, but then I felt something cold touch my shoulder, and I immediately freaked out : this is the end of the story time for another one. Also, if you are under 10 again, please do not listen to this one by the way, the first one was called the man and now this one is called the creature who lives in the attic attic: the creature who lives in the attic: basically I was eating my Oreo. Yes, I’m obsessed with them until I heard something from the attic. I thought it was just some mouse or anything, but then it started to grow louder like banging on the floor. I’m only a child so I was terrified of monsters so I ran out of that hallway like a shooter was in the house. I’m a very fast runner. I told my mom and she said it was just a mouse, but I said it grew louder when she came over. She heard it. She immediately called the cops and she made me follow her because she was worried something might happen to me and I’m not the very good person to fight when police arrived I like police officers so I was asking them for an autograph like they are Taylor Swift and he said maybe later kid when we figure out what is in the attic and I said thank you thank you thank you when they went to search one of the police officers was so frightened they showed me a picture of the creature. It was pale and it walked on four legs. It had no face so they immediately called BFDI when they came the monster was dragged out. It had a muzzle on it so it wouldn’t do anything and then after I immediately to the officer, can I have my autograph noww and he said fine fine and he gave me his police name and his autograph on it. I was so happy that the monster was gone and I got an autograph so happy ending?? by the way I’m too lazy to do 3 so sorry y’all see you later. See you later. See you later"

"~ NOT TRUE STORY<3 SCARY BTW, WARNING. ~





""I went to an abandoned mall with my friend near midnight, but a bit after her dad asked her to come home, I hugged her as she was leaving, then she turned when she was walking and asked, 'You should leave, I don't think it's safe to be here alone..' But I shrugged it off like nothing and said 'I'll be fine.' and she looked worried but turned back and mumbled 'Okay..'. Then a bit into it I found an old play place in the  mall, On the wall it still had old balloons saying happy birthday, but the remaining ballons made it be spelt like 'H A Y   B R H Y' I looked at the play structure, and it looked fine, but it was dark and had a disgusting smell. I thought I heard someone say something, but I thought I was paranoid. Then there was an ear-piercing place I saw in the abandoned mall too. I looked in disgust at 4 bloody ears on the ground, hair, and blood puddles. Then I heard footsteps. I got worried and thought I was paranoid again until I saw the escalator moving, and someone at the bottom. LITERALLY. 'Hello?..' I siad, voice a bit shaky, then they started walking up the escalator. QUICKLY. I thought run and I did, they came after me, then I tripped, letting him grab me and everything. He actually just helped me up and looked at me. 'W-wait who are you-??' I asked. He didn't answer. But he grabbed me and brought me to a toy room, where there were hammers and everything. I wasn't looking at him, mostly looking at this book until I saw blood. And then the guy grabbed a hammer and hit me with it. I woke up in a dark, bloody, hospital chair, and chained to the bed. He had a chainsaw as he came towards me. What do I do?

One night I was watching tv home alone bc my parents were at work when all of a sudden a hear these big bangs up in the roof and it sounded like something was about to explode. I just ignored it bc my neighbours had motorbikes and they sound like that. But then I hear it again and the sound was getting closer. I was getting super scared and was about to call my mum but it stopped I was still scared so I tried to distract myself. Then I heard footsteps coming closer and closer I started to cry because I didn’t know what to do so I hid behind the couch. Then the footsteps were going to the back of the house. I got my phone and a random toy bc I didn’t know if I need to defend my self. As I was walking the lights went out and then back on. I then saw the garage door open I quickly called my parents but when I was calling my mum someone’s phone started ringing from the garage. I found out it wasn’t an intruder it was my mum. She was trying to fix the power 😅 by the way I don’t know why their was noises in the roof I’m still scared
One day a mom called her son to eat then the son said i don't want to but that's not his mom his phone fell but a hand catches it and he looks at the bottom of the bed and there's the mom injured almost dying. And the son hid under the bed the mom died due to bloodloss. And the imperfect clone walks into the room and finds him. He escaped but the clone is still chasing him he goes to the police station and says someone is following me it's the clone of my mom the police didn't take him seriously. Then the clone walks in and the police officer says why are you doing this to me to the boy and the boy says it's not me as he's running and he walked into the forest the clone chasing him and then the clone catches him but can't grab him. He was schizophrenic and he killed his mom and the police officer. And the clone is just his amagination

Just playing with my cousins, my mom was watching until she started using her phone, my cousin who was 2 years old than me held a really long scythe and put it on the gate pretending it's a bird, and... the long scythe fell on me, I didn't feel pain so I just laid on the floor with a bleeding scar on my head, seeing the light, my mom rushed me to the nearest hospital because we were at my cousins house, and then like 2 days after I was okay, I don't have fear of scythes, I'm not traumatised from the experience, it was kinda like ""Ok my life's ending"" I didn't have a mindset back then, that was when I was 5, I'm now 10, still not in high-school:("
"Here's a story! :D (this isn't real!)


     Charlie was just getting off the bus, now walking home from school. It was oddly quiet, most kids weren't at school that day though. It was cold and windy, and only a couple cars passed by. But when they did pass, they were fast. As if they were in a hurry.

     When Charlie got home her mom wasn't there like usual. Maybe she's just at the grocery store? Charlie's brother, Austin was home though. He didn't really say anything, just a hi. Charlie started working on her homework in her room when she heard the front door open. It's her mom! But she's different Charlie's mom didn't have that look she usually had, her mom had this tired look as if she never slept and she was also unusually calm.
     ""Mom you good-? You look tired..."" Charlie asked. ""Yeah yeah, I'm good sweetie.."" Her mom doesn't call people sweetie ""Um.. Okay- Where'd you go anyways?""
""Oh I just forgot some stuff at work, I had to go get them."" Charlie's mom said nervously. 
     Charlie went off to her room to go finish that homework she started before mom came. scratch scratch ""What was that...?"" Charlie looked at her window, where the sound was coming from. She saw a figure standing out there. It stood tall, not making a sound. It then disappeared into thin air.. She stood there shaking, not knowing what just happened. Maybe she just needs rest..?
     She went to bed, she's probably just tired. In Charlie's dream she's in a room, it's dark and she can hear a faint scratching sound, but it's hard to locate where it's coming from.. Suddenly the same figure shows in her dream. It has a gun.. It points it at her and when it pulls the trigger she wakes up, sweating. ""What the heck...""

I'm gonna finish thgis later"

"Oh ok sorry I lost track,, will get work on it soon everyone"
"Perfect 😈 Lena it is.
Here’s the complete long horror story, rewritten and expanded — tense, cinematic, and chilling until the last word.
👁️ “The Mirror That Remembers”
Chapter 1 — The House She Should’ve Never Inherited
When Lena’s grandmother died, the old mansion on the edge of town became hers.
People whispered that the house had a pulse, that it “breathed” when you were alone.
But Lena didn’t believe in ghosts. She believed in proof.
The house was three stories high, its roof caved in from years of storms.
Every step she took echoed through hollow halls.
The air smelled like dust, lavender… and something rotten underneath.
In the upstairs corridor stood a tall mirror, shrouded in a black sheet.
Words were carved into the wood:
“Do not uncover what remembers.”
Lena ran her fingers over the engraving. “Creepy,” she muttered, forcing a smile.
But that night, she dreamed of a woman standing where the mirror was — whispering her name.
Chapter 2 — The Footsteps
The next morning, Lena woke to the faint sound of footsteps.
They came from the hallway, slow and dragging.
When she opened her door, no one was there.
Only wet footprints, small and bare, leading to the covered mirror.
She stared at them.
They stopped right in front of the mirror — and vanished.
By afternoon, she tried laughing it off. Maybe an animal got in.
But that night, she dreamed again — the same woman whispering,
“You look just like her…”
When Lena asked, “Who?”
The woman’s head twisted at an unnatural angle, and the dream shattered into darkness.
Chapter 3 — The Whisper
On the third night, it started speaking.
A faint voice from behind the covered mirror:
“Lena… do you remember me?”
Her heart nearly stopped. She stumbled back, grabbing her phone, but the screen flickered — dead.
Then, faintly, another whisper:
“You used to stand here. Every night. You used to smile.”
The next morning, she searched through her grandmother’s journals.
Most were recipes, prayers… and one short entry, written shakily:
“The mirror knows her face. I should have broken it years ago.
If I die, tell Lena never to uncover it.”
She dropped the book.
Her grandmother knew. She warned her.
But against every instinct, Lena felt drawn to it — like the glass was calling her name in her bloodstream.
Chapter 4 — The Unveiling
The fourth night was storming hard.
Thunder rolled. The house trembled.
The whispers came again — louder this time, desperate.
“Lena, please. I can’t see. Take the cover off.”
Her hands shook.
Lightning flashed outside, and for a moment, she saw a faint shadow moving under the sheet — like something pressing its face against the fabric from the other side.
She yanked the cover down.
The glass was cracked and fogged, but her reflection was there — wide-eyed, trembling.
Then it blinked.
Once.
Twice.
Out of sync with her.
Lena gasped and stumbled back.
Her reflection smiled. A slow, wrong, human smile that stretched far too wide.
It lifted its hand and tapped the inside of the mirror.
A muffled sound — like knuckles against glass.
“Finally,” it whispered.
“You remember me now.”
Chapter 5 — The Memory
Lena backed away, whispering “No… no…”
The reflection stepped forward — but she didn’t move.
It was walking toward her, from inside the mirror.
Suddenly, the glass rippled like water. The air turned cold enough to sting.
Flashes of faces appeared in the reflection — dozens of them — crying, screaming, trapped.
“She kept us here,” the voice said, but it was coming from behind Lena now.
“Your grandmother. She took us in… through the mirror.”
Lena turned, and the woman from her dreams stood there — pale, hollow-eyed, her mouth stitched at the corners.
The stitches snapped open as she whispered,
“Now it’s your turn to remember.”
Hands — cold, glassy hands — reached out from the mirror and dragged Lena forward.
She screamed, clawing at the floor, but the wood cracked beneath her nails.
Her reflection smiled one last time before pulling her inside.
The mirror went still.
Chapter 6 — What the Neighbors Heard
When the storm ended, the house was silent again.
Neighbors said they heard someone screaming during the night, but no one came out.
When police arrived two days later, they found the front door open and the halls empty.
Only one thing had changed.
The black sheet was gone.
And in the tall, uncovered mirror stood Lena — smiling faintly, her hand pressed against the glass.
If you look close enough, you can still see her eyes move.
And if you stand there long enough,
you’ll hear her whisper — soft as breath:
“Do you remember me?”
Would you like me to make a Part 2 — like a sequel where someone else finds the mirror years later and the haunting continues? 



Not by me by chatgpt





Edit;omg i got 400 likes"
"started one night when Aira moved into her grandmother’s old house. The house was beautiful, but there was one locked room at the end of the hallway. Her grandmother used to say, “Never open that door, no matter what you hear.”
On her third night, Aira heard it — a soft whisper from behind that same door.
“Aira… let me out.”
She froze. The voice was faint, trembling… like someone crying.
She ran to her room, telling herself it was just her imagination. But the next night, it came again, louder.
“Please, Aira… it’s so dark in here…”
Her heart pounded. She placed her ear against the wood — and something knocked back. Three slow knocks.
The next morning, she searched the house for a key but found none. Still, the curiosity grew like a sickness. On the fifth night, she couldn’t resist anymore. She grabbed a screwdriver and forced the door open.
The room was empty — dust everywhere. Except for a mirror standing in the middle.
In the reflection, she saw herself… and behind her, a pale figure smiling.
The door slammed shut. The whisper turned into laughter — low and broken.
Now, if you walk past that old house, you can still hear her voice behind the same door saying,
“Please… let me out…”"

"THE RAKE STORY!!    
So one day me and my friends were having a sleepover and I thought well this is gonna be fun. Soo as soon as they had arrived at first we went to my bedroom as soon as we got to my bedroom there was a chill in my back so at first I just shook it off thinking it was no big deal but after a while of chitchating I heard a bang or smthn like that so I looked out the window but there was nothing there and just saying we live near the woods so it was kinda creepy. But anyways I went back to talking then we decided to play roblox and we played for maybe an hour or more then all of our phones/tablets started glitching so we went to go see what our sisters were doing and ofc they were fine... Sorry I have to go but if we get to 20 likes I'll do a part 2😊

Ty for the likes but anyways as I was saying they were fine th n out of no where my friend pushed me then went to the kitchen me and my other friends just stared at each other in disbelief after a moment we walked into the kitchen and saw my friend looking for something then after seeing this what she was looking for she said a cup then I pointed to where our cups were and she grabbed one and said sorry I just felt really thirsty all the sudden! Then me and all my friends were confused so we decided to make smthn to eat so we could forget what just happened. After about an hour it was 1:00 and we were bored again until I looked out the window and saw my dog just staring at the woods so I closed the blinds then opened them again to see my dog then sleeping peacefully on the grass then that's when I really got scared and something felt wrong so I just went back to my friends in the kitchen and they were laughing and drinking sprite. Come back  for part 3 if we can get to 25 like 

Since we got to 25 I'll do the part 3 soo I went in the kitchen with them and I also got a cup of sprite  but right after I get a cup it sounds like a scream outside the window I thought I saw eyes glowing but idk which I'm a weirdo and I always be taking things seriously 😅 so I asked my friend if she had just saw what I saw?? And she said"" idk what your seeing you have been acting like this all day!!"" it made me mad but ofc they didn't care 😢 I asked if they wanted to go watch a movie in my room and they all said  sure we decided to just play games instead tho but while playing games a spider crawled on my friend which disgusted me sooo I abandon my own room I at least stayed off until it was killed. Then my dog started howling and there was a tall skinny black figure just standing in the woods that night I couldn't really sleep but I finally did still to this day we don't know what it was but that was 2 years ago..... 40 likes and I'll tell another scary story.. If we do get to 40 tho I have a more scary story......you know what lets do 30 likes instead cause I know i probably won't get 40😅 tysm for the likes since we got to 30 I'll do another story

So one day my bff came over for the first time to see our new house and stay for the night when we went to see the back yard there was a deer which I love nature so I thought it was a beautiful deer then I blinked and it was gone then I felt like we were being watched so we ran inside so I could show her my bedroom then we looked in the closet to see how big it was then we saw a teddy bear with a note the bear was dirty with ripped parts on it and then I looked at the Note and it said"" if you have no one to play with I will always be here even if you don't  wanna play I'll still be here!"" I threw the bear at the was and threw away the bear and the note until that night I had a weird feeling something was watching us then the next day I was at my writing desk then I looked up in my cabinet to get my colored pencils when I saw the same bear with the same note.... 40 likes for part 2 of the teddy bear incident. 

Ok I'll take 35 likes but anyways I saw the bear again I grabbed my phone and called my friend to tell her but as soon as she answers it was gone so I asked my mom if she saw a bear and she said yea it was in the trash yesterday but it was cute so I put it up there a moment of relief struck me then I still wondered how it just Disipeared  out of thin air I walked to my bedroom which was dirty so I was just gonna clean up when I lifted other carpet the note was there but it said smthn diff it said "" nice try I said I'll always be here!"" that's when I remembered what the note said that night I fell asleep and I had a really weird dream about the bear.... 40 likes for part3  
Part 3 of the bear incident as I said after I fell asleep I had a dream about the bear then I woke up to the smell of breakfast in the kitchen  but when I looked over my side the bear was there I tried to burn it that same day while my parents were at work  then I walked into the living room to see my sister holding what looked like a new teddy bear but it looked the same as the one I tried to burn soon enough after about a year of that thing I disappeared and we moved houses I'm still hoping that who ever lives there now I hope your doing ok......

So I turned around to see no one there so I started  running back to the gate when my other friend grabbed my arm and said  wait but the voice kept getting louder and saying DO NOT GO BACK!!!!! Then a loud bang stopped me then when I turned around there was no one 😮 part 2 for 270 likes...

So as I said in one story we live close to the woods and theres a pond deep in the forest so one day around 5:00pm I heard a bang on my door so I slowly walked over and opened the door slowly then I saw my friend she said heybi saw the text so I can stay the night right? And I said yea you can which I had forgotten I asked if she could. Then we went to go prank my sister by putting fart spray all over her room then we ran out and closed her door! After hearing her gag we started laughing  then she ran out the door then we smelled the spray and we ran too. But we got bored after a while so we went to my mom to ask if we could go fishing and my mom said she so we ran out side and I fell on my face while going down the stairs 😂..

"TRUE STORY 
So I had a friend one day I came over to her new house after she moved. It was this place that look almost 500 years old creepy stairs, creepy floors, creepy paintings so we were hanging out in the attic and it was about midnight. We’re gonna go downstairs to her room to go sleep because we were both really tired, but then I remembered when we were in the attic I had left my pillow up there so I went to go get it it wasn’t a place where there was a random wall. It was like a tiny corner. Would it be really nice to read and then I see it this humongous thing with I think drool coming out of its mouth like it was ready for its next meal BTY the last owner of the house had died and then I went running down screaming, and then my friend wasn’t in sight. I went outside and they were police cars, and some person in handcuffs. My friend had told me that there was a break-in, but when I was up in the attic, I heard no police sirens and no break-ins later that same year, my friend went missing they haven’t found her but ever since in that neighborhood they speak of the house and whoever buys it they either tell them to move out or try to not be friends with them because they know it will soon be over for them too…"

This was based on a “true” story. 

So, I was just playing roblox on my tablet in bed until I heard a big bang coming from the attic. I just ignored it but it banged again. It sounded like something or someone was up there. I kept ignoring it but my tablet died so I went to sleep and then I heard the attic door open. I woke up but saw it was closed. I thought it was my imagination but then I went to sleep then heard it open again I woke up to see it was open. It was like 5 minutes before I woke up. I panicked because I thought someone went under my bed. But I remembered I had boxes underneath so they couldn’t fit. I went downstairs to tell my parents but they weren’t there.

"True story Something scary happened. I was home alone one night when I heard a loud banging coming from the basement. My heart started racing as I slowly made my way down the stairs, the only source of light coming from my phone's flashlight. The banging grew louder and more frantic with each step I took. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I saw the basement door violently shaking as if someone or something was trying to break through. I stood frozen in fear, not knowing what to do. And that's when I heard a voice whisper my name from the other side of the door..."
"Part 2 super scary... was when the lights suddenly went out, plunging the room into complete darkness. The sound of heavy footsteps could be heard approaching, getting louder and louder with each passing second. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to control my breathing and remain as still as possible. Suddenly, a cold hand grabbed my shoulder, causing me to scream in terror. I turned around to see a figure standing in front of me, their face shrouded in darkness. As they reached out towards me, I closed my eyes and braced myself for the worst..."
"Part 3 super super scary... was the haunted house at the end of the street. The rumors surrounding the old abandoned mansion were enough to send shivers down anyone's spine. Stories of ghostly figures appearing in the windows at night, strange noises coming from within its walls, and a chilling presence that could be felt by anyone who dared to get too close. Despite the warnings from the townspeople, a group of brave teenagers decided to investigate the house one dark and stormy night. As they approached the creaky front door, they could feel the hairs on the back of their necks standing on end. The door swung open with a loud groan, revealing a pitch-black interior that seemed to swallow up any trace of light. With trembling hands, they stepped inside, their hearts pounding in their chests. Little did they know, they were about to uncover the terrifying truth behind the haunted house..."

"""As a child i always loved the woods, they were comforting in a way mainly because i used to live next to one and play with my friends after classes were finished. One night me and my friends tommy, john and albert went out into the forest to see if we could find anything, as local legends said their were many cryptids or other things in the forest. Being only 10 or so during the time we thought nothing would happen but oh were we wrong... so we went in i had my bb gun that i had just got and the rest had sticks, we got deeper and deeper in the forest and heard it, it was a deep scratching noise sounding like it come off a metal chunk, but we didnt remember seeing anything metal in the woods, so we investigated and we found a little bunker, being stupid we dared albert to go in by himself and when he eventually agreed we shut him in, at first everything was fine but. Then we heard it a shrieking coming from inside... and it wasnt albert.... he screamed for us to open to door but it wouldnt budge and that was the last we heard of him we decided to run home and get our fathers cause they were over for dinner so we got out of the forest and i looked back and saw it a tall pale creature with boney features, it seemed although it was wearing alberts face and smiling at us. In the morning our fathers called the cops and helped them look. When they found the bunker it was indeed to late. Alberts body lay frozen in the ground and faceless... its good to say that we never forgot albert and didnt go deep into those forests ever again."""

"Real story


When I was laying in the bed with my brother and Mom. We heard someone run into the bathroom so we decided to check IT out. To our surprise, we  found no one. Our dog was sleeping peacefully like if nothing had happened. We were the only ones at home with our dog at that Time


To this day, we still dont know who IT was but I believe IT was a Ghost As we have a cemetery infront of our house and I hear noises like FOOTSTEPS and things falling off, the chair moving like someone WAS sitting in IT. Now i'll sleep with my Mom cuz IM too scared to sleep alone"
"It’s not scary it’s just surprising.

So my nanna (grandma) past away last month on 10 August and when I went back to school after the 6 weeks holidays, I said to myself in my lesson “I hope I have space raders” which are crisps in England but Americans call them chips. And then when it was lunch time I opened my pack lunch to find space raders there. I was thinking it was a coincidence. Then not long after like two days later I asked for quavers which also are crisps. And I got them. Then at lunchtime break it was my classes time to play football. But before we went out for break I wished that this kid in my class who I don’t really like called ‘Jodie’ I whished for her to another play. So I’m wondering if it’s my nanna who’s being nice to me from heaven but idk"

What are you doing there?"" And my mom also saw it too, she was also like ""honey?"" And then she gasped, she looked at me and whispered ""(my name).. dad went to work."" And we were both shocked and turned back to the spot and that thing was gone.

"There was a girl named Angelina, she was four and her mom told her never to go outside, because they lived in the forest and Angelina promised she wouldn't. When she was 17, she tried to go outside, but her mother spotted her and she got scolded. So every time when it was her birthday, she would ask to go outside, but her mom always said no. When it was her birthday again, no one was there because her family died by a brown bear, but she would not find them, so now she would make breakfast, dinner, and cakes for her birthday by herself. When she was 71, she broke her promise and went outside. She thought she was old enough and would live forever. But then she got attacked by a black bear.

Lets play a game :  first if you’re parents went on a trip and left you behind with you
"Horror story its very long so stay tuned 

every day a new family moves to the cul-de-sac, let alone one that moves in at three in the morning. Still, when the moving van pulled up to the dilapidated house at the end of the street, the flickering porch light the only welcome sign, the neighbors all pretended not to notice. From his bedroom window, nine-year-old Finn watched the figures, shrouded in darkness and haste, unload a single, oversized, black cabinet. It seemed out of place, an ancient relic in a sea of modern suburbia, and as they struggled to carry it into the house, Finn swore he saw the wooden doors of the cabinet bulge outward as if something from inside were pushing to be let out.
The next day, a girl Finn’s age, her hair as black as the cabinet and her face pale as bone, introduced herself as Lily. Her parents were reclusive and unfriendly, a stark contrast to the neighborhood’s usual cheerful, outgoing residents. Lily spoke in a whisper, her eyes wide and dark, like two endless pits. “We’re not staying long,” she murmured when Finn asked about her family. “Father says it’s just for a visit.” But a visit to whom, Finn wondered. He glanced toward Lily’s house, and through the dust-streaked window, he could just make out the shape of the large black cabinet, now placed ominously in the center of their living room.
The oddities began subtly. Mrs. Gable, the street’s gossipy matriarch, complained that her prize-winning rose bushes were wilting overnight, the petals turning black and shriveled. Mr. Henderson, a man of routine, swore his late-night dog walk was being watched by a pair of glowing red eyes from the window of Lily’s house. No one believed him, of course, dismissing it as the ramblings of an old man with a vivid imagination. But Finn knew better. He had also seen the light—a faint, unsettling crimson pulse emanating from the window of Lily’s living room.
One evening, Lily appeared at Finn’s doorstep, her whisper more urgent than usual. “He’s restless,” she hissed, her eyes darting nervously back to her house. “My father tried to calm it, but it didn't work.” Finn’s blood ran cold. The cabinet. He thought of the bulge, the frantic pressure against the wood. What kind of thing could cause such unease? He asked her what was inside. Lily only shook her head, a tear tracing a path through the grime on her cheek. “Don’t ask,” she pleaded. “Just… don’t go near the house after dark.”
But curiosity, a far more powerful emotion than fear for a nine-year-old, drove Finn back to his window. He watched as Lily’s parents hurried inside, their movements stiff and hurried, and the porch light flickered and died for good. A low, rhythmic thumping, like a slow, heavy heartbeat, began to pulse from their house. It vibrated through the quiet evening air, a deep, resonant sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of Finn’s home. He held his breath, pressing his face against the glass.
The thumping grew faster, louder, more frantic. Finn could see Lily’s father standing before the cabinet now, his back to the window. His shoulders began to shake, his movements growing more spastic and uncontrolled. He seemed to be struggling with something unseen. The thumping ceased, replaced by a low, guttural growl that seemed to vibrate the very air. Finn’s hand flew to his mouth, stifling a terrified gasp.
Suddenly, Lily’s father stumbled back, and his wife rushed to his side. They both stared at the cabinet, their faces etched with pure terror. Finn watched in horror as the giant cabinet doors slowly creaked open, revealing not a shelf-lined interior but a swirling, inky darkness. It was a hungry, endless void, and from within, a single, glowing red eye opened, fixing its gaze directly on Finn’s window.
The night air, once filled with the rhythmic thumping, was now deathly silent. Finn felt a chill deeper than the evening air settle into his bones. His mind raced, replaying the awful scene. The fear on the parents’ faces. The endless darkness within the cabinet. The single, malevolent eye. He crept away from the window, pulling the curtains tightly shut, as if the thin fabric could shield him from the horror he had just witnessed.
A new sound began. It was a soft, methodical tap, tap, tapping, coming from the window of Lily’s house, now perfectly illuminated by a full moon. Finn froze, his heart pounding in his chest. It was a deliberate, insistent rhythm, like knuckles on glass. It was a familiar sound, one that had been heard before but dismissed. Mr. Henderson had heard it, only his was a dog walker being watched. But now, it was clearer, more focused.
Finn squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block out the image of the cabinet, the void, and the hungry, endless darkness inside. But the tapping continued, and a new, terrible thought dawned on him. Lily had said her father had tried to calm it. What was ""it""? And why was it now looking at his house?
His blood ran cold as he remembered Lily’s final, terrified words: “He’s restless.” And in that moment, Finn realized the tapping wasn’t just a sound; it was a beckoning. The thing in the cabinet was not happy. And tomorrow, the cabinet would have its eye on a new home. The end i guess i got no likes😢"

"When my sister Betsy and I were kids, our family lived for awhile in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the ghost. We called her Mother, because she seemed so kind and nurturing. Some mornings Betsy and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we’d find a cup that hadn’t been there the night before. Mother had left them there, worried that we’d get thirsty during the night. She just wanted to take care of us. Among the homes’ original furnishings was an antique wooden chair which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, Mother would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. Sometimes she’d manage to move it all the way to the centre of the room. We always felt sad putting it back against the wall. Mother just wanted to be near us. Years later, long after we’d moved out, I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse’s original occupant, a widow. She’d murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she hung herself. The article included a photo of the farmhouse’s living room, with a woman’s body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room.”

…Did it get colder in here, or is it just me?"

When I tell you I ran back down the hallway and back into my apartment and lock the door. I sit on the couch and the little boy   Is standing at my door along with the shadow of a little girl with a white nightgown on. I couldn’t move speak or nothing.

Freddy backed away, his heart beating a marathon, sweat poured down into his eyes, Jesus Christ he was scared! 
Freddy ran as if he had never ran before, his shirt flapped in the wind like a ship raising its sails in a tornado, speaking of which, Freddy couldn’t think straight, his emotions had been swept away, clean out of his mind. That’s when he heard it.

Not footsteps. Not breathing. A dragging sound. Slow. Wet. Like something pulling itself along the ground, refusing to be left behind.

Freddy’s legs burned, but the sound didn’t fade. It was closer now—scraping against the tarmac, nails or claws or something worse.

He risked a glance over his shoulder.

The man wasn’t running. He was standing. And yet, somehow, the distance between them was shrinking.

The streetlights above flickered, one by one, as Freddy tore past them. Shadows stretched unnaturally long, reaching for his ankles. His lungs screamed for air, but the dragging sound was in his ears now, inside his head, matching the rhythm of his heartbeat.

Then—silence.

Freddy slowed, chest heaving, eyes darting. The road ahead was empty. The air was still.

And from right behind him, a voice whispered, low and cold: ""You shouldn’t have run."" Freddy whipped around, only to be met with nothing. He looked up; it was dark. Freddy saw something else, though... In the corner of his eye he was met with, atop a large grey building, a pair of eyes looking down at him, Freddy felt his knees begin to shake uncontrollably, his pants flapping like flags, Freddy felt heavy rainfall hit him, he heard the constant pitter-patter of rain hitting the floor, but he never looked at it, for he was looking at the pair of eyes towering above him… Wind pushed the rain into Freddy’s eyes, and he yelped in pain, toppling over to the floor, wiping his eyes, “Uh oh…”  He thought fearfully, hoping he was wrong, he opened his eyes, and he was right. The silhouette rushed past him as if a trick of the light, but Freddy saw the eyes were gone and he knew… that the man was right behind him."

"Okay ✅ here’s a horror story: (not real)
Day 1: Just the beginning 
So one time there was this girl named Stacy, who loved to draw what she always felt and what she would do. She was mute, so she couldn’t speak, she could cry, laugh, and scream but never talk.
One day after school she saw her friends hanging out near a clown, this clown doesn’t look normal, it wore a black top hat, black and white clown suit, and carry a full trash bag full of things. This clown couldn’t talk, but she was creeped out.
“How was your day?” Her older sister Martha asked her. She nodded. Martha, Stacy’s older sister took care of her since she was born since her parents had passed away in a car crash when they were taking Stacy home, she was the only one who survived.
Slow, but creek wind entered the hallway as Stacy clattered her fork to her dinner plate. Martha could only afford one meal, so they created a system where they’d split their meals and drinks to not starve to death.

Day 2: Weirded out

“Good morning, Stacy. Remember you have to walk home I have a business meeting today. Wish me luck! Bye!” Said Martha as she grabbed her coat from the hanger and rushed out the door. Stacy waved as she left. Stacy was all alone, so she decided to put on the news. News: “Sunnyville bridge local news” she clicked on channel 3: “Sunnyville residents begin to disappear as going hiking, please stay indoors and lock all doors, windows and stay indoors, people!” Said news reporter Kent.

Ok so once, this was when my grandmother was visiting and staying at our house. And in our kitchen, we have 3 windows and a back door. There was this one window where u can look outside of. And basically, my grandmother was looking out there. After a minute or so, she went to my dad asking if that was him outside (btw this was in the morning) 
but the thing is, he was never outside in the first place. She explained that she saw something pass by fast and was gonna go around into the backyard. She was gonna go to the back door to see if it would come, but she said turned back and went back fast again. We were all confused cuz none of us saw it except for her. So, my dad decided to check the cameras. (We have cameras outside that ALWAYS detect if someone passes by. Even animals, even us) and when he checked the footage, no one was there, so we went outside to test it and go infront of the camera, and it detected us, but not the figure that our grandmother saw. She said it looked like they had on a white shirt and black or red pants, and my father had on  similar clothes (black top, red shorts). So to this day, i think my grandnother saw a spirit or ghost because she said it isnt her first time seeing one, she saw one when she was a child."

——————————————————-

When I was 6, I woke up in the middle of the night..
My dad woke up, he told me go to sleep, smiling…
I slept, the next day, I got a PS5 because I did chores.
That night… I woke up, I got out of my parent’s room…
And of course, my dad was snoring, showing he was asleep.
I went to my living room, turned on the tv and played on my PS5…
I played for about 6 hours, I was so happy, I was full of joy. But then..
I was playing, I didn’t notice it until 9 seconds later…
I didn’t hear snoring.
…
I turned the tv off. Got off my brand new PS5… but I still wasn’t safe….
I hid under my couch… but then I heard footsteps… I was about to cry… but held it in.
But then my dad… he went in the living room. With a belt.
My mom… she was approaching the couch with a slipper…. I knew I wasn’t safe….
She looked under the couch, so did my dad! But I wasn’t there… that’s because…
I quickly ran to my parent’s bedroom and went underneath the bed because my parents didn’t see…
So I was under there for a few minutes, my dad went to sleep because he gave up, my mom was still looking.
My mom looked everywhere, then caught me… 
Under the bed.
…
…
…
My mom saw me. My dad woke up, that night I got hit by a slipper, and got hit with a belt. 
My dad made me sleep in my bedroom now on, I told him I wasn’t ready to sleep by myself yet….
He told me that if I didn’t… I would get spanked with a belt again.
…
So that’s the story of how I sleep in my bedroom now.. and that was 40 years ago… now I’m 46….
I don’t sleep with my husband…
I sleep alone….

"☆TRUE STORY☆

A little while ago, i was laying down on my bed scrolling through YouTube on my phone. I hear a quiet little tap from under my bed. At the end of my bed, under it, i saw brown hair swaying. I knew my sister loved to prank me a lot, so i thought she was just trying to scare me like always. ""Lola, get out of my room"" i yell. The brown hair still stayed where it was. 
 ""Lola, im being serious,  Get.Out.Of.My.Room!"" I yell slightly  louder than last time. My sister emerges from her room and stands in the hallway looking at me. ""what are you talking about? I was inside my room."" I stay frozen on my bed and look back under it to see the brown hair gone. At first i thought, (maybe it was just a wig) but i remembered  that we dont own any kind of wigs. I tell Lola exactly what i saw under my bed. She was even terrified herself!"

"The man in the suit…
WARNING: THIS IS NOT A TRUE STORY ITS A ANALOG HORROR
This man was an actor of Godzilla. But since Godzilla was invented in Japan. They called him goji or gojira. The man would suddenly stop.. and he told the producers Idk I kinda forgot. So the producer tapped him telling him that’s a joke! But he kept stopping. So they checked and opened the suit and this is what they found…: the man in the suit 
                                                          Was stuck in the suit. So you might be thinking he was stuck but it actually became his OWN skin… so the toho group hiding it all and just filmed. Even the actor of goji couldn’t breathe into the suit but still did the roll perfectly. But.. he even would sweat into the suit very badly. I will edit this comment soon. My hands are a bit tired."

"As the days passed, Emily's transformation became more pronounced. She would wander the streets, her eyes vacant, her smile twisted. People avoided her, fearing the strange influence that had taken hold of her.

The townsfolk tried to figure out what had happened to Emily, but she wouldn't respond. It was as if she was trapped in a world of her own, a world controlled by the stranger's dark powers.

One by one, more people began to fall under the stranger's spell. They would gather in the town square, their eyes black, their movements robotic. The townsfolk realized that the stranger had left behind a dark legacy, a curse that spread like a disease.

A small group of survivors banded together, determined to uncover the truth behind the stranger's powers. They scoured the abandoned house, searching for clues. In the attic, they found a journal belonging to the stranger.

The journal revealed a dark history. The stranger had been collecting souls for centuries, using them to fuel his own twisted powers. Ravenswood was just the latest stop in his eternal journey.

The survivors realized that they had to destroy the source of the stranger's power. They searched the house from top to bottom, finally finding a hidden chamber deep beneath the earth. Inside, they found a small, ornate box.

As they opened the box, a dark energy burst forth, threatening to consume them. But they stood firm, determined to break the curse. With a collective effort, they destroyed the box, shattering the stranger's hold on the town.

Slowly, the townsfolk began to return to normal. Emily's eyes cleared, and she remembered fragments of her past. The town of Ravenswood began to heal, but the memory of the stranger's dark powers lingered, a cautionary tale about the horrors that lurked in the shadows.

But as the townsfolk looked up at the night sky, they noticed something strange. A figure, tall and gaunt, stood on the hill, watching them. The stranger had blood, your still here?!

"don’t care if no one believes me. I know what I saw. And I know it happened.
It started maybe two weeks ago. I’d wake up at exactly 3:17 a.m., every single night. No sound, no nightmare — just boom, eyes open, wide awake.

At first I thought it was stress. School, family stuff. But then I started noticing small things — my door cracked open, even though I always close it. My desk chair turned around, facing my bed. I even found my closet door slightly open a couple times, even though I never leave it like that.

I live with my mom. She works overnight shifts sometimes, so I’m home alone a lot. I thought maybe I was just freaking myself out. But then, one night, I woke up and my room felt... wrong.

Not scary. Just off.

I sat up in bed, and I swear to God — I heard a soft click, like the sound of a phone camera.

I froze. Didn’t move for maybe a full minute. Then I slowly reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up. No notifications. But the battery was at 1%. I’d charged it fully before bed.

I opened my camera roll.

There was a new photo. Taken at 3:17 a.m.

It was me. Asleep.

But here’s the thing: the angle wasn’t from the nightstand. It was taken from the corner of my room — where my closet is.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I sat there holding a baseball bat until sunrise.

Mom said it was probably some glitch, or maybe I accidentally triggered it. But I know how that photo looked. I know I didn’t take it.

I deleted it, reset the phone, everything.

Last night was the first time I slept okay since it happened.

Until I woke up this morning.

And found a sticky note on my desk.

In handwriting that wasn’t mine.

It said:

“You’re a heavy sleeper.”"

"The Darkened Hallway

I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling as the clock ticked away. The sound was monotonous, a steady heartbeat that seemed to match the rhythm of my own pulse. It was well past midnight, and the house was quiet. The darkness outside seemed to press in on the windows, making the room feel small and claustrophobic.

As I lay there, I began to feel a sense of unease. It started as a faint tickle in the back of my mind, growing into a nagging feeling that something was off. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But the feeling persisted, gnawing at my nerves like a rat in a cage.

And then, I heard it. A faint creaking sound coming from the hallway. At first, I thought it was just the old house settling, the wooden floorboards groaning under the weight of years. But then I heard it again – a soft, deliberate step.

My heart skipped a beat as I threw off the covers and got out of bed. The floorboards creaked beneath my feet as I padded silently to the door. I pressed my ear against it, listening intently. The creaking had stopped, replaced by an unsettling silence.

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, my ear pressed against the door. The silence was oppressive, weighing heavily on my shoulders. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, the sound echoing through my ears like a drumbeat.

Slowly, I turned the handle and pushed the door open. The hallway stretched out before me, dimly lit by the moonlight streaming through the"

Stay safe in the US!!!"
this was based on a true story in my experience. i was camping in the woods alone because i thought it would help me clear my mind and be at peace but the second night fell everything started feeling wrong the silence wasnt natural it was heavy like a blanket being pulled over the world and then the smell hit me strong and sour like rotting meat and when i walked a little out of the tent i saw them the animals all dead in a perfect circle squirrels birds even a deer lying still their eyes missing like something had scooped them out clean and i froze because their bodies weren’t old they were fresh like they had just died and i felt something watching me not from far away but from somewhere close and when i turned around no one was there but it felt like something had just ducked out of view and i ran back into my tent zipped it shut and sat in the dark because i was too scared to use the light and then came the breathing slow thick and wet right behind me inside the tent and then the whisper dont turn around and i couldn’t move because i knew if i turned something would be there and my hands were shaking and i felt the fabric move like fingers brushing against it and then everything went quiet and i passed out and when i woke up the next morning it was still dark and that made no sense and the animals were back more of them piled up around the tent and this time their mouths were open like they were screaming and i saw footprints dragging around the tent like something had crawled in circles all night and that night i stayed awake again and around midnight i saw it a black figure standing just at the edge of the clearing tall thin its head tilted slightly like it was studying me and it didn’t move it just stood there not blinking not breathing just watching and my body moved on instinct i zipped the tent shut as fast as i could hands shaking heart pounding and i sat there holding my breath as the silence pressed down on me like the air was trying to crush me and i didn’t sleep at all and when the sun rose and light finally spilled through the fabric i didn’t even pack up i just walked away left everything behind and i never came back to the forest ever again but the whisper followed me home and now every night i hear it just behind me telling me not to turn around and the smell came too sometimes its in my room and sometimes its in the hall and dead animals keep showing up first it was a bird then a cat then a dog all with their eyes gone mouths open in that same silent scream and the worst part is my phone keeps taking pictures by itself and when i check them sometimes theres a black figure in the corner standing closer every time and last night i looked in the mirror and saw it behind me not in the room just in the mirror and it smiled

"What Thomas Found in the Basement”

Thomas Grey was the kind of kid who didn’t lie — except about one thing: the basement.

He’d lived in the same house since he was three. A creaky old place with drafty windows and long, moaning floorboards. But it was the basement door that made his skin crawl.

It was always locked. Always.
His mom would walk past it like it didn’t even exist.
If Thomas asked about it, she’d change the subject.
Once, when he was ten, he tried to jiggle the handle. She snapped at him so loudly, he cried.

Now he was twelve. Old enough to notice strange things: the soft thud that came from below at night. The dragging sound. The occasional… scream.

He told his friends at school. Most didn’t believe him.
“It’s probably a rat,” said Gavin.
“A broken water pipe,” said Ellie.
But Thomas knew the difference between a rat and a voice begging for help.

One Friday, his mom got called into a night shift at the hospital. “Don’t go poking around,” she warned. “Dinner’s in the fridge. I’ll be back by morning.”

As soon as she pulled out of the driveway, Thomas stood in front of the basement door. He stared at it. The metal handle shimmered under the hallway light.

This time, it was unlocked.

His heart thudded in his chest.

He opened the door.

The smell hit him first — sour, damp, like rotten leaves and meat. The steps descended into darkness. He flicked on the light switch. A single bulb flickered weakly at the bottom.

He crept down.

The basement was… empty. Just gray walls, old cobwebs, and a workbench with dusty tools. For a moment, he felt stupid.

But then he heard it.
A whisper.

“Thoooomassss…”

He froze.

The whisper came from the wall. Or rather, behind it. A section of brick near the back looked newer, like it had been sealed recently. He stepped closer.

The whisper turned to a moan. “Please… help…”

Thomas’s fingers shook as he grabbed a rusted hammer from the workbench. He chipped at the bricks. Bit by bit, the wall gave way.

And then he saw it — an eye.

A real human eye, wide and bloodshot, peering out at him from behind a small gap in the bricks.

Thomas screamed and stumbled back. The voice cried louder now. “Please! Please! Let me out! I’m still alive!”

He ran. Up the stairs. Slammed the basement door shut and locked it. His heart felt like it would rip through his ribs.

When his mother got home at 4 a.m., she found him curled up in the hallway, pale and shaking.

He pointed to the door. “There’s someone down there! Behind the wall!”

Her face didn’t change. Not even a flicker.

“Thomas,” she said calmly. “That’s not your concern.”

She reached into her bag and pulled out a keyring — with one silver key Thomas had never seen before.

He watched in stunned silence as she unlocked the door and walked down the steps without hesitation.

The light flicked off behind her.

A minute passed. Then two. Then—

Thud.

Drag.

Whisper.

The door locked from the other side.

Thomas never saw his mother again.

And the screams didn’t stop. They just got louder."

🕯️ The Watcher of Westfield

In 2014, a family bought their dream home in Westfield, New Jersey: a beautiful six-bedroom house in a quiet, upscale neighborhood. But within days of moving in, strange letters began appearing in their mailbox—typed, anonymous, and terrifying.

> “Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? I’ve been watching it for decades...”

Each letter became more sinister. The writer claimed to be ""The Watcher,"" someone chosen to watch the house and its inhabitants. They knew the family’s names, the children's nicknames, and even referenced renovations the owners were planning—as if they were being watched from inside.

> “It cries to me to come and claim it… I’m waiting for you.”

The family stopped sleeping. They installed cameras, alarms, and began to fear every creak of the floor. The letters continued. In one, the Watcher asked:

> “Will the young blood play in the basement? Who has the rooms facing the street? I’ll know as soon as you move in…”

They never moved in. Months later, they sold the house at a loss. And still, no one has ever discovered who the Watcher was. Some think it was a disturbed neighbor. Others believe it was someone obsessed with the house itself.

To this day, 657 Boulevard remains infamous."

"(NOT MY STORY)

I was walking down my street when I saw a man, looked like he was in he's 40 or 30, I walked passed him, he looked at me in a really creepy way but I just ignored it. I was just walking down the block to get my daily leg night in. He started following me, I kinda thought he was just going the same way as me but no. He grabbed my wrist hardly and pulled me into a black van with 2 other guys, he drove me to a house that looked old. I tried everything I could to escape but they wouldn't let me go. They took me in and knocked me out. When I woke up I was tied up to a bed str!ped out of my clothes, but they were not in there with me, I could hear someone coming to the room that I was in so I faked being asleep, he gr@ped me on that bed and left after. When he left I tried to break free from the rope that he tied me up with but it wouldn't move. He continued to gr@pe me every day, but one day I got really sick, I begged him to take me to the hospital, he took me to the hospital, and they checked on me, not only did they find bruises on me but they found out that my kidneys were failing. The doctor got super worried, without him knowing, she called the police department about it, when they showed up they arrested him on the spot, he was actually wanted for who knows how long and the police didn't get him. But the doctor saved me. Know I live happy with my baby.

"The old house stood on a hill overlooking the town, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out at nothing. Everyone in Oakhaven knew about the Blackwood place, and everyone knew to stay away. Stories whispered through generations spoke of Silas Blackwood, a recluse who, it was said, dabbled in things best left undisturbed. He'd vanished fifty years ago, leaving the house and its secrets to rot.
One sweltering July night, as a storm brewed on the horizon, a group of teenagers — fueled by bravado and cheap thrills — dared each other to spend an hour inside. Liam, always the ringleader, pushed open the creaking front door, a sound like a tortured moan. Dust motes danced in the last slivers of twilight filtering through the grime-caked windows. The air was heavy, stagnant, carrying the faint, metallic tang of something ancient and unidentifiable.
They explored, flashlights cutting shaky paths through the gloom. A grand staircase, its banister carved with grotesque faces, led to the upper floor. Downstairs, the living room held skeletal furniture draped in white sheets, like ghosts awaiting a séance. It was in the study, however, that the true unease began. Bookshelves lined with leather-bound volumes, some titled in languages none of them recognized, filled the walls. On a cluttered desk, among dried inkwells and yellowed parchment, lay a single, open journal.
Sarah, the most academically inclined of the group, picked it up. Her eyes widened as she read the spidery script. ""It's Silas Blackwood's,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible"
"A STORY I MADE TF UP 

the day was warm, too warm...
the metal building i think it might have been some sort of tower that i never saw being built, the building melted in a matter of seconds revealing corpses of im pretty sure everyone except me the melted metal spelled out ""1984, India"" im pretty sure a huge gas leak or something happened and a new smaller date, that date was today as of writing this im pretty sure im not gonna make it to next year"
"True story: my cousin and her brother slept at my house and this morning I woke up early but both were still asleep and after a few minutes or hours I heard like their fighting but then I heard it both upstairs and outside but it sounded more like the noise came from upstairs so I went upstairs but I checked that they were still asleep I thought I got mimicked and I didn’t dare to look behind and I ran downstairs as fast as I can. So if you don’t know the mimic thing idk if it’s true or not but my friend told me, so for example your mom go to the grocery and ur home alone and everyone else who live at your house is busy and ur home alone and you heard a knock on the door you open the door but you see nothing or anybody and you look behind because you want to go back to ur room or something else and u saw a ghost it’s SCARY 😟"
I like eating wood
One night I was in my bed it was night time and I looked in front of me and I saw a shadow I immediately closed my eyes and hid under my blanket when I checked to see if the shadow was gone it was daytime and I've only had my eyes closed for a like 5 seconds it was like magic
NOT TRUE.Story 2 the kid who met aliens. Once there was a boy that loved to read books and eat candy one day he read a book about an alien then he went to bed the next morning he checked his candy bowl and it was nearly empty so the next night he decided to put more candy in his bowl and see what happened it was night time he filled his candy bowl and hid under his blanket 30 minutes when by and he almost falls asleep but then he sees a light and two aliens come inside his room through the window they take his candy and they leave the house the next day the the boy never put candy in that bowl again. So remember if you want to see an alien just leave candy somewhere.

"⚠️❗️TRUE STORY❗️⚠️


So my cousin came at my grandparent's house to visit them and I knew she would come so I was here too! We usually bring toys to play so yea now it was my turn to bring some. We hugged eachother and we immediately went upstairs to play. We started a roleplay and my cousin had to go to the toilet. I waited for her to come and then when she came she said she heard some weird noises so I agreed because I also heard them. We felt a little weird because we were single upstairs because the people were downstairs so my cousin was braver than me and she said ""let's check!"" So we went where we heard it. I stopped my cousin and I said ""but there is our great grandmother's room and she passed away"" so what it could be? She entered the room so I also did behind her. She looked with attention but then I freaked out and also her because we started to hear scratching noises from the window. I pointed with my jaw a little open to the window and there was a black figure so my cousin ran and she left me behind but I also ran after her. We went downstairs and we talked about the black figure from the window. Then we got brave and we went to check!

[Part 2 at 0 likes! 💗]

We went upstairs again and we went to our great grandmother's room to check again. Now the black figure wasn't there anymore but it was in the other room because we heard the weird noises again. We checked and there it was a weird creature but it wasn't the first one. At night we had a sleepover and we decided to sleep upstairs because we wanted to play again plus we didn't care about the creature thinking it was just our imagination. We were playing but we got tired so we went downstairs to get some night snacks. We got some chips, fruits and drinks and we went into the bed to watch television. We were comfortable when suddenly a light appeared behind the curtains so we went on the balcony to check. There was our grandpa with a lantern checking something that he heard. We said ""grandpa, what are u looking for?"" and his response was ""I heard some weird noises..""

[Part 3 later! ❤]


Ok so my grandpa went into the garden with the lantern but we came too. Then we saw a humanoid figure but it dissapeared immediately. We went into the home fast as we could and we told the people (mum,dad, grandma,uncle and aunt) what we saw and they believed us so the next day me and my cousin checked the garden and there was no one. It was night, we decided to have another sleepover so we'd let the curtains open and we watched our favourite film with our favourite snacks. The sleepover was about to check if the black figure would appear. It was 2 am and we were tired. My cousin feel asleep after a few minutes but there was a shadow reflecting in our room because outside was pitch black and the black figure was outside so I freaked out and woke up my cousin pointing at the shadow. She took a photo of it and then went to check (she is older so she is braver) and the figure dissapeared. The a theory came in my mind and I told my cousin ""hey, if the first place where the figure came was the great grandmother's place, let's check it!"" So we took a lamp and went into the room. I was shaking and shivering because even if it was my idea, I am scared. We checked and there was no one..

so basically me and my friend were at my house and we were bored so we went back into my woods because we have a creek. and we started exploring and it was so much fun. we took cute pictures and found a cotton mouth snake and a wolf spider the size of my palm. But as we got about a mile into the creek it started to reek of some horrible smell. and we have found a dead armadillo down there before so we didn't think anything of it at first. until we got closer...and my friend went ahead of me and as she went around the corner she stopped and gasped... and i said WHAT?! and she ran to me crying and i went to look with a weapon ofc. (a stick) and i saw it... a dead man that looked about in his 40 blue bandana rapped around his mouth with blood coming out of it. and jeans and a grey shirt that had holes in it and blood around it. then i looked over and saw a knife in the water next to him... so then we ran back home faster than ever and told my mom and she called the cops... they finally arrived about 10am a later and took a look at it and the next day the found out it was our neighbors about 5 houses down that have alr been to jail for doing dr**. and he owed him smth but couldn't give it to them so he mu***** him instead. but pass forward about 4 years now and nothing crazy like that has happened again.

"⚠️TRUE STORY⚠️

: So one day I went to Mongolia with a couple of friends when I was 9, and I was the oldest in the group. One night my friend and I woke up to a man screaming his head off, right outside or second story window. I’m talking-voice-is- getting-hoarse-because-you-think-you’re-gonna-die-screaming. It went on for hours, and we had no idea what to do. Eventually I get up close to the window, and when I looked outside, terrified this dude is gonna see me, there’s on one there. I shut the window and the screaming stopped immediately. 


      Our friend who was in the room, connected ours didn’t hear a thing, and neither did the other group of friends in a different room on the same floor. The only ones who heard it was me and my friend who I was sharing a room with.


 Creepy, but nothing bad happened to us, and now it’s all over right?

WRONG!


So that night I’m like, I am NOT getting woke up again, I don’t care what loud noises people decide to make. I put my earplugs in, I got my eye mask on, life is good and I sleep throughout the night. The next morning, my friend in the other room connected to ours comes into my room and says, “The police was here last night.” 

Someone knocked on our door, and I ignored it, but they knocked again, so I answered and it was the “police”. They walked into our room and looked everywhere and left. 

Because I was wearing earplugs, I slept throughout the whole thing. What makes this terrifying for me, is that we were in a foreign country-we have no idea what the police uniforms look like, or what there allowed to do. Again we escaped unscathed, but sometimes I shudder to think, what might have happened…if it had been someone pretending to be a police. 

Turns out that police was a serial killer and was looking for weapons if they tried to find any and REAL police have been trying to look for him for a long, long time."
"⚠️ Fake Story I made it up ⚠️

The Ghost Flight
It was a dark, stormy night when Flight 713 took off from the airport. Passengers settled in, unaware that this flight would be anything but normal. As the plane soared through thick clouds, the cockpit suddenly went silent. The pilots disappeared without a trace, leaving only eerie silence.
Strange things started happening. The lights flickered and dimmed, and passengers began to hear whispers coming from the overhead compartments. One by one, they saw shadowy figures lurking in the corners of the cabin—ghostly faces with hollow eyes staring at them.
Then, the hijackers appeared—men in dark masks, but their faces were distorted, twisted with anger and sadness. They didn’t speak, only gestured wildly, as if warning the passengers about a terrible secret. One of the passengers, a young woman named Emily, saw the ghostly figures behind the hijackers—victims from long ago, trying to warn her.
Suddenly, the plane dropped sharply. The ghostly faces grew closer, reaching out with cold, invisible hands. Emily realized the plane was being haunted by spirits—victims of a past tragedy—who had taken control of the flight to seek justice.
In the chaos, Emily remembered an old story: to escape the ghosts, she had to face her fears and tell their story. With trembling voice, she spoke aloud about the tragedy that haunted the spirits. The shadows wavered and slowly vanished, the hijackers disappeared, and the plane stabilized.
When they finally landed, no one remembered what had happened—only Emily knew the truth about the ghostly flight, and the restless spirits that still lingered in the skies.

Each summer, the six of them gathered in the sleepy town of Greywood, where an abandoned watermill by the misty river was their secret hideaway. Layla, Alice, Olivia, Ellie, Poppy, and Tillie loved one thing: whispering secrets into the river at midnight, passing folded paper with their deepest fears. Legend said: if you whisper them six times, the river remembers—and answers back.

This year, curious whispers began echoing through the watermill—as if the old wooden walls absorbed and returned their words.

Night One – Answers in Ripples
Ellie was first. She whispered six times: “I don’t belong.” That night, she awoke to the sound of six soft knocks at her door—each one reverberating with a voice she recognized: her own. She didn’t open it. In the morning, she found six tiny puddles of river water on her floor.

Night Two – Echoes Grow
Poppy confessed her deepest fear: “I’m not strong enough.” That stormy night, she dreamt of six drowning girls, calling for help. She woke gasping, drenched—but it hadn’t rained. In her hand, she found a folded note: “Is six enough?” No signature.

Night Three – Sixfold Pact
They met at the mill in daylight, shaken. Layla suggested performing the full sixfold whisper ritual: six fears, six whispers, one answer. They wrote:

Layla: “I’m alone in my pain.”
Alice: “I won’t forgive myself.”
Olivia: “I am just a shadow.”
Ellie: “I don’t belong.”
Poppy: “I’m not strong enough.”
Tillie: “I’m lost.”
At midnight, they whispered their words one after the other—six times each—into the river’s dark surface.

Night Four – The Response
They waited. In the old mill, the wheel began to turn on its own. Olivia gasped: six ripples crossed the water inside the millrace, concentric and alive. From the darkness stir whispering voices:

“You are one.”
“You are two.”
“…six.”
And then silence.

Night Five – Unraveling
In the following days, each girl began changing.

Alice woke with her reflection empty-eyed—until she didn't remember the whisper.
Olivia found shadowy figures trailing her always in photographs—always six.
Poppy discovered in her dreams six versions of herself, drowning—but never dying.
Tillie heard six voices calling her name when she looked in mirrors.
Layla woke to find six written apologies scrawled in her notebook—none by her.
And Ellie? She was gone that night. No note. No trace—just that single candle left burning by the riverside.

Night Six – Final Whisper
Desperate, the five remaining girls returned to the mill. The river had swallowed the night sky. They whispered again: six voices uttering one name—Ellie—hoping to bring her back.

The waterwheel stopped. The river stilled. The water in the mill rose until it pooled around their ankles. And then, soft footsteps from six directions, calling:

“Six…is…now…one.”
Their lights went out. Cold water closed overhead.

Morning — Six Become None
The next dawn, the mill was empty. No footprints. No scream. No ripples.

In the mud by the riverbank lay six folded notes:

“I belong.”
“I forgive.”
“I am.”
“I belong.”
“I am strong.”
“I am found.”
They whispered, the river answered.

And now: it’s silent."
"Title: Six Shadows in Glass

Six friends—Izzy, Sophie, Florence, Lauren, Thalia, and Sofia—decided to spend a weekend in an old lakeside manor. Inside, a massive antique mirror stood in the grand hallway, the kind that seemed to absorb light and breathe shadows.

Night One – Whispers in the Mirror
They circled it, teasing each other:

Sophie challenged, “Mirror, mirror… show us six today.”
Izzy whispered her full name—and the glass briefly fogged, though the room was cold and still.
But Florence noticed something odd. When she looked, there were seven reflections—six girls and one extra figure, just at the edge, faceless.

Night Two – Reflections Grow Darker
That evening, Lauren dared them to perform a game: each girl would stare into the mirror, say her full name, and ask aloud, ""Who watches me?"" They did.

One by one:

Thalia saw her reflection blink when she didn't, lips curling into a sinister grin.
Izzy gasped when her mirror-version raised a hand to her throat, but Izzy herself touched her own throat—pulselessly calm.
Sophie saw six flickering images around her own, whispering names none of the friends recognized.
Then the mirror went black, reflections vanishing altogether.

Night Three – Shadows Cross Over
Sofia, the courageous one, crept to the mirror late at night. She pressed her palm to the glass.

Her reflection smiled back in a way that felt alive.

Sophie found her the next morning—collapsed before the mirror, eyes wide open, skin chalky. The others rushed to her, but Sofia was gone.

Where the mirror had stood, now there were six empty spaces in its frame.

Night Four – The Last Five
Panic settled like ice. They dared not speak their names again.

But the mirror reappeared that night on the hallway wall, clearer than before. One by one, more girls vanished:

Florence disappeared from a photograph taken that evening—her face blurred to pale mist.
Izzy vanished when Lauren looked just away for a moment.
Sophie was dragged into the mirror’s surface, her voice echoing: “Say my name.”
Thalia and Lauren remained—terrified, guilt-stricken.

Final Night – Two Left
Only Thalia and Lauren stayed, waging silent war with the mirror. They covered it with sheets, but the glass sighed behind them, a low rattle like skeletal laughter.

Thalia whispered, “We made them say their names… we invited it in.”

Lauren pressed her ear to the sheet: six voices, faint and broken.

One by one, Lauren heard them call her name. She froze, sobbing.

When she looked, Thalia had turned to face the mirror, eyes vacant.

Thalia's lips moved.

Lauren screamed a full name.

The sheet dropped.

Morning
Lauren woke alone. The mirror stood empty, the room stale and silent.

Six reflections had crossed over.

All the girls were gone—pulled into the glass, erased from this world.

Lauren touched the mirror’s cold surface. She stared—and for a fraction of a second, she saw her own missing eyes, staring back, far beyond her."
"Title: Echoes in the Fog

Izabel, Sophie, Florence, Lauren, Thalia, and Sofia had been inseparable since birth—their birthdays always falling within a week of each other. When they turned sixteen, they celebrated with a trip to secluded Mistwood Lake, hidden deep in a forest perpetually shrouded in chill fog.

On the first night, they gathered around a bonfire and made a blood pact: “By this pact, we swear we will always be six. Not one less.” Their laughter echoed into the mist… and something answered.

By dawn, Thalia was missing. The girls searched frantically, finding her pendant lying at the water’s edge—but no sign of her. Digging through memories, they realized nobody could quite recall when Thalia had vanished. In one moment she was there, the next she... wasn’t.

That day brought nightmares:

Izabel awoke to whispers swapping her name for ""Thalia,"" each time she spoke.
Sophie stared at her reflection and saw a girl she’d never met wearing Thalia’s pendant.
Florence, the peacekeeper, found ancient words scratched into the cabins: ""Still six, always six.""
Lauren heard six voices calling her name—but only five faces were present.
Sofia found her phone filled with selfies—with a shadowy sixth figure silently standing beside them, half-blurred and wrong.
As the days passed, they drifted apart in terror. Bonds snapped, memories frayed. Only one thing remained constant: the lake. On the third night, they returned to its edge. The mist thickened, swirling like living smoke, and a distorted silhouette emerged from the water.

It looked like Thalia—except its eyes were empty voids, face warped, the pact’s blood smeared across her throat. It raised a hand and whispered, “You broke the pact.”

Panic erupted. Each girl felt a cold claw around her heart, pulling—erasing.

Sophie screamed, ""We always swore six—""

The creature smirked. “But now… you're only five.”

In that moment, Izabel lunged into the mist, grabbing Sophie’s hand. A wave of frigid air slammed them both. They tumbled backward as the creature dragged into the lake—taking Sofia’s hand last. Her scream cut short, swallowed by the fog.

Morning came with the fog lifted—but only four girls remained, huddled on the shore. They found a single, damp pact written in blood on a driftwood plank: “Six must remain.”

But nobody remembered who left.
They only knew one terrible truth: the lake keeps its promise."

"He used to be my best friend. I thought he was a good guy he still is but I don’t know what changed in him in eighth grade. He changed after the second semester. I was like why are you so sad and depressed he said leave me alone. I never knew he always talked behind my back. He said he’s so goofy looking so bad word stuff and one time my friend told me it and I was not surprised not shocked. I was full of betrayal and disbelief as I looked there and sat down. He came to talk to me and say hi bro I said, leave me alone. I know you we’re talking behind my back. He told me after that his face went. Pale he said I can explain but I said no don’t explain yourself leave me alone after a few weeks. He called me almost 452 times I never answered never ever until finally I said what do you want he said I’m sorry it was this guy that said I’m gonna bully you so hard and punch you and do everything do this for me or something bad will happen to your mom after he said that I said I didn’t believe you and but with his phone, he recorded it after I heard it my face went pale, I said that iii…….s keemy… and he said what do you mean didn’t he die I said I remember his voice that’s him THAT IS HIM AND he was WHAT I was like be careful bro remember in fifth grade that I will kill you guys and get my revenge and we did nothing wrong. He bullied us and bullied him after that we went back home he said bro my house is just full of noises and I said bro get out of your house. He said no I’m on my second floor. I said, jump out of the window and grab your stuff. That is keemy he said what if I’m not gonna be OK and break a bone I said do you wanna die or do you wanna break a bone He said OK fine he came out. He didn’t break anything and booked a taxi to my house because his mom and dad were on a vacation and they couldn’t drive him after that. He arrived at my house and I paid the tax the money he came there I pulled out my dad’s gun and he said what I was gonna do that and I said he was following you after that we heard a loud noise and I knew he was in the house. I said hide and i hid 2 after that he came in and said hello hello where are you I came out of nowhere and said what do you want from us the moment I looked at his face, his face was 82% burnt. He looked like.jeff the killer but 10 times scarier he pulled out a knife and tried to stab me and said you will deserve your faith after that I shot him in the leg 3 times I had a security camera playing. I placed it there when he broke in after that, I called the cops they arrested him and asked me some questions and we got free and he was sentenced to jail for life because he killed 23 other people"

"" i only had one pencil so the other pencill was up there noone was going up so then we just left it there and tried to forget about it but then stuff kept on happening so then i said ""l-l-lets just play again??? "" they all said no😅 so once when i got home alone with the keys and was about to put them back but then i saw the tv turn ON!!!!! i started breathing fast i washome ALONE and the tv before it was off i ran away and i sliped on nothing in stepped back and was thinking what was gonna happen i was seriously overthinking!! I still know the ghosts with me i am a medium the thing is i still dont know if the ghosts nice or bad i still sometimes see them and momo ""maybe i am just going crazy? "" nope its true even my friends have incidents we always call our group chat when stuff hapend. fun fact; when we call we all have incidents

"It actually happened THIS YEAR on THE FOURTH OF JULY and this is real ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️STORY⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️so we were on the balcony watching it then we couldn’t see so we went outside with the fathers (except mine my dad was at work prolly drunk ) and then there was a firework you put in a box and we got down like 30 minutes ago because we couldn’t see and it was our turn to light up fireworks AND SOEM GROUP OF F#UCKING KIDS( sorry I am so mad about this) it was a group of four one of them was wearing black ( probably the leader) and the others were wearing white. We can see you three stupid. Anyway the white clothing ones walked around the other side of the house and the black clothing one went through the other side and there was two trailers in the back of the backyard  and the black clothing one lit up a firework and one of the fathers told us all WATCH OUT! Because it fell towards us and as I was saying the ( I think) leader lit up a firework and threw it INTO A TREE and you know how I told you about the box of fireworks ? I firework was coming to me I PUT MY HAND UP I FROMT OF A BABY AND A FIREWORK WENT TO MY ARM IT BOUNCED OFF AND THEN it like 🎆and another one went to my relative that was one year older then me also got hit in the arm like me after i immediately put a bandage and so did my relative we both CHASED THE GROUP we fought them until they ran away and then we went back and changed to go to the gym and we ALL went to the gym ( it was my mom the two fathers ,me and my one year older relative) we all practiced and me and my relative didn’t do much because we were injured,then we went to the hospital to see how bad it was,(FACT if I didn’t put my arm up it would hit the baby) and then we called the cops and they caught them and also kids BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU LIGHT FIREWORKS! AND LOVE YOU!"
"This isn’t really like the typical scary. This is more like something that I would think is scary.





So I was just chilling in my room watching TV, then all of a sudden my parents were arguing (it was a common thing. If you grew up around my mom, she always started it.) my dad was recording things that she was saying. but then things took a slight turn. I heard the sound of a gun being loaded. me, and my sister ran down the stairs, which was sort of dangerous because our mom‘s room was right across the hallway, we got outside safely, and my dad was on the phone with the police, and my mom was inside on a rampage about how he doesn’t take care for us. Meanwhile, he is the only one who showed up when we needed him. then the cops showed up, questioned my mom, took the gun and left. now, six years later. she will have a chance to be released from jail in October."
"⚠️TRUE STORY ⚠️🩸
One time at about 4 pm in 2006 i was street racing with my mates and i was going around 60 mph in a school zone and i went around a bend and rear ended a bus and the bus driver called the police and because i didn't want to get caught i decided to drive off and at about 6pm it was dark because it was like December i tried to steer my car but there was a piece of black ice on the road and i hit a tree so because i was on a backroad i decided to run into the forest and tried to call my dad but realised i left my phone in the car and as i went back the police showed up and i just ran away and ended up lost in the forest and luckily got back home at 2 AM"
"🕯️ ""The Voice Behind the Wall"" 🕯️

When Leah moved into the old Victorian house on the outskirts of town, she knew it came with a history. The real estate agent called it “character.” The neighbors called it cursed.

The first night was quiet—until 3:33 a.m. That’s when she heard it.

A voice.

Soft, almost a whisper, coming from behind the wall in her bedroom. It wasn’t muffled like someone next door. It was clearer. Closer.

""Leah… are you awake?""

She froze. No one knew she was here yet. No one had called her name.

She pressed her ear against the cold plaster. Silence.

Shrugging it off as her imagination and exhaustion, she went back to sleep.

The second night, it returned. Same time.

This time, it didn’t whisper her name. It laughed.

A dry, cracked, inhuman laugh—too loud to be from behind the wall. It felt like it was right next to her, inside the wall… or inside her head.

She tore the drywall open the next morning. Nothing. No wiring, no pipes, just dust and a smell—musty, like old blood.

The third night, she set up her phone to record. She fell asleep with every light on.

When she checked the video in the morning, it was five hours of nothing—until 3:33 a.m.

The screen went black, but the audio kept playing.

Footsteps. A dragging sound. Then… the voice.

""Why did you open the wall?""

A long pause. Then a raspy breath.

""Now I can come through.""

The last thing on the recording was a sudden, ear-splitting scream—and then the camera was knocked over, the lens shattering.

Leah never watched the footage again.

Because when she looked up from the video, her wall—completely repaired the day before—had cracks forming in it again.

And that night…

The voice didn’t wait until 3:33.

It spoke to her from right behind her mirror."
A guy walking towards me with a job application.
"Title: “Room 313”

Part I: The Guest Who Checked Out
The Bellmore Hotel was nearly forgotten—one of those roadside motels tucked off an old highway, where the neon buzzes but never fully lights, and the carpets always smell like mold and secrets.

Jason was the night clerk. It wasn’t a glamorous job, but it was quiet. Until the man in black checked into Room 313.

He didn’t give a name. Paid in cash. No luggage. No ID.

Jason handed him the key and muttered, “You’re the only one on that floor.”

The man just smiled.

A week later, when housekeeping finally went to check… Room 313 was empty.

Not “he checked out” empty. The bed was still made. The TV was on. The lights were off. The walls were covered in writing, scratched into the wallpaper like claw marks:

“I never left. I never left. I never left.”
And on the bathroom mirror, written in something thick and brown-red:

“Don’t let them put anyone else in here.”
Jason requested a transfer.

They denied it.

Part II: The Door That Opened Itself
Jason started hearing things.

Footsteps above, when no one was booked on the third floor.

Whispers in the hallway: fragmented, like voices underwater. One night, during his shift, the front desk phone rang. The ID said: Room 313.

Jason stared at the screen for a long time before picking it up.

All he heard was breathing. Ragged. Wet.

Then a voice that sounded like his own said:
“You’re not supposed to hear this.”

He unplugged the phone.

But the next night, it rang again.

Part III: The Camera Footage
He asked the manager to pull the security footage—just to prove he wasn’t crazy.

They watched the tape from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM.

Nothing unusual at first.

Then they saw it.

Room 313’s door slowly opened. A dark figure stepped out, crawling—not walking, but slithering on all fours like an insect. The lights flickered as it moved. Its head twitched at impossible angles. No face. Just a void where a face should be.

The figure crawled down the hallway and stopped.

Right in front of the security camera.

It stared directly into the lens for 43 minutes without blinking.

Then the tape ended. Just static.

The manager laughed nervously, shut the laptop, and said, “Must be a glitch.”

Jason handed in his resignation the next morning.

Part IV: But You Can Never Leave
Jason moved three states away. Got a job at a gas station. Tried to forget.

But some nights, the lights flicker there too.

And last night, Room 313 called his cellphone.

He doesn’t know how that number exists.

He didn’t answer.

But the voicemail is still there. Just breathing.
And at the very end, his own voice whispering:

“We’re all in the room now. And you left the door open.”
THE END"
"Part I: The Picture Frame
Nine-year-old Lily hadn’t spoken since her mother died.

She’d been in the car when the crash happened—glass and blood, the sound of her mother’s final breath like paper tearing—and now she just stared. Her father, Mark, tried everything: therapists, schools, toys. Nothing reached her.

Until the day he brought out the old mirror.

It had been her mother’s favorite. Antique, with a bronze frame carved into thorny roses. Mark put it in Lily’s room, hoping some memory would spark comfort.

That night, Lily whispered her first word in months.

“Mommy.”

Part II: Mirror Talk
Mark thought he was dreaming when he heard Lily giggling.

He stood outside her room, just past midnight. Inside, she was sitting cross-legged on the floor, facing the mirror, speaking in soft tones.

“I missed you, Mommy.”

His stomach dropped.

He stepped in, but Lily turned and shook her head violently. “You’ll scare her,” she hissed. Her eyes were wet with joy.

Mark looked into the mirror.

Nothing. Just a reflection. But Lily saw something else. Something behind the glass. Her smile was wide, innocent.

“Mommy says she can come back if I keep talking to her. Every night. No matter what.”

That night, Mark moved the mirror into the attic.

That night, he heard scratching on the ceiling.

Part III: Mommy’s Face
Lily wouldn’t eat. Wouldn’t sleep unless the mirror was nearby. Mark gave in—put it back in her room.

That’s when the drawings started.

They were always the same: a woman with black eyes and a mouth stitched shut, reaching out from a broken mirror. Lily called it ""Mommy’s Other Face.""

“She had to change when she went to the place under,” Lily explained. “The cold place. She said the pain made her look different now. But she still loves me.”

Mark cried in the kitchen that night, holding his wife’s old photograph.

The next morning, the photo was gone. In its place was a new one. Of her, yes—but distorted. Her eyes blackened. Her smile too wide. And in the photo frame, etched like it had been scratched in:

""I’m coming back. You promised.""
Part IV: The Price of Return
Lily’s skin grew paler by the day.

She said Mommy was “borrowing her strength.” That it was okay. “She’s just using me to open the mirror all the way.”

Mark found a note one morning. A child’s handwriting:

""Tonight is the last step. Please don’t stop it. I want her back. Even if she’s not the same.""
He burst into Lily’s room that night.

The mirror was no longer reflecting the room—it was a window. On the other side was a dark hallway, and from it came the sound of wet footsteps.

Lily stood at the center of a circle drawn in red.

“Don’t ruin it!” she screamed, voice not entirely hers.

The mirror cracked. From the broken glass, hands emerged—long, gray, and trembling.

Mark grabbed Lily, but she looked up at him with empty eyes.

“She promised she’d bring Mommy back. She never said she’d leave me behind.”

And then she vanished.

Part V: The Grief That Remains
The police never found Lily.

They found the mirror, shattered. Blood on the edges. No footprints. No signs of break-in. Mark told them she ran away.

But in his heart, he knew.

He sleeps in the living room now. Drinks too much. Talks to no one.

And every so often, he hears a child’s voice from the attic.

“She’s almost ready to come through.”

Sometimes, when he looks in the mirror, he swears he sees Lily’s face—her mouth stitched shut, eyes wide with terror—begging him to help.

But he can’t.

Because sometimes, she speaks with her mother’s voice.

THE END"
"Part I: The House in Black Hollow
James Everly had no business inheriting anything from his estranged uncle. They hadn't spoken in 15 years—not since James fled Black Hollow after that night with the well. So when the letter arrived from a law office, telling him he was the sole heir of the Everly Estate, he thought it was a scam.

But the keys were real. The property deed was real. And the nightmares that returned the moment he stepped onto the creaking porch… those were the most real of all.

The house hadn't changed. The gabled roof still clawed at the sky like a broken spine, and the windows blinked with the grime of years. Inside, the air was wet and thick, as if the walls were breathing. James felt it immediately—the presence. Not just memory. Not just dread. Something was in that house. Waiting.

Part II: The Hole in the Floor
Three nights after moving in, James was woken by scratching. Not mice. Not rats. Something larger.

It came from beneath the floorboards of the old parlor—the room his uncle had always kept locked. James pried the boards open, heart hammering, and found… a hole. Perfectly circular. The wood had been gnawed, bitten, into the shape of a mouth.

And from that hole, a pale hand reached out.

James didn't scream. He couldn’t. The hand froze, sensing the air. Then it retreated slowly, scraping the sides with its nails. James closed the boards and nailed them shut, sealing whatever it was inside.

But the scratching came back. Louder. Angrier. Closer.

Part III: The Pale Man
James tried to leave. His car wouldn't start. His phone was dead. Every window he smashed healed overnight. The house wouldn't let him go.

So he waited. Waited for the thing to show itself.

And on the seventh night, it did.

He woke to find the boards torn apart, wood splinters scattered like bones. The hole yawned wide, black and slick with some kind of ichor. From it emerged a man—or what was left of one.

Its skin was paper-white and translucent, stretched over bones too long and too sharp. Its face had no lips, just a permanent, torn smile, exposing hundreds of tiny, yellow teeth. Its eyes were lidless, sunken pits that wept black fluid.

The Pale Man crawled forward, sniffing the air. James was frozen. The thing turned to him, its head cocking like a dog, and it whispered in a voice like crumbling paper:

“You left me in the dark. You let me starve.”
James screamed and ran. But the house had changed. The hallways stretched, rooms looped into themselves. He ran for hours, doors leading to dead ends and mirrors and worse—reflections of himself being consumed by the thing.

Part IV: The Truth Beneath
In his desperation, James returned to the hole. He dove into the blackness, falling for what felt like hours. At the bottom was not soil or rock—but a chamber, ancient and pulsing with veins of red light.

He saw carvings. Symbols. Worship. The Pale Man was not a ghost. He was summoned. Fed. Imprisoned.

And years ago, when James was a child, he helped his uncle seal the Pale Man in the floor. They used the blood of the family dog. James remembered the screaming. He remembered the bargain: “The house protects us as long as we feed it.”

But then James ran away.

The house hadn’t forgotten.

Part V: The New Host
James never escaped.

They say sometimes, at night, you can hear screams from the Everly house. Sometimes, the parlor door swings open on its own. And if you're quiet… you’ll hear scratching beneath the floorboards.

They say a new Pale Man lives there now.

And he’s very, very hungry.

"Here's a short thing  so i""m in las Vegas u was in the car driving around  but then my mom caught  a guy on the floor Unconscious on camera and he got hit by one of these things and his body was twisted and my mom said he didn't make it and three ppl called the ambulance"

"NOT TRUE STORY

So basically my 6 year old cousin (Michael) has his own room, and one day he came over to my house and we decided to draw, and I chose the topic as ""family"" so we started drawing and 5 mins later we were done, and when he showed me his drawing, it had him, his mom, his dad and Larry!?...
(Part 2 at 5 likes)
(Sorry I know I'm late!!)
I ask him, ""Who's Larry?"" Thinking it's his amganary friend or smt, but tbh at that moment his reply actually creeps me out, and he said ""He's a man living in my vent!! But sometimes he scares me by saying stuff like, one day you'll be my kid and NO ONE WILL KNOW!!"" For a second I get kinda freaked out so we started doing smt else and I ignore what he said thinking it's just his dreams, but it really freaked me out about what he said, so when we got to his  house I told his parents and they said ""Oh sweetie he's just having bad dreams!! Sont worry!!"" I went off with a little ""O-oh ok"", but I knew I had to check so I asked him if he wanted to play in his room, he said ""sure"" and when we went to his room, he looked in the vent like he was a spy and said, ""Phew he's not there, but he for sure will be later😢"" I looked at him like saw someone getting killed and said ""I-is it o-ok if I ch-chek?"" He said ""Yep its okay for now he's not here"" ""W-well where is he?"" I ask,

(Part 3)
And he responds with smt that scares my soul out, ""He's probably in momy's and dady's room"", ""Oh uh okay"" I say. So I go on his bed and try to open it, but it's screwed in, so I just. take a peek in the vent and what I see, oh God 
It's horrifying! What I saw was a blanket, a pillow, along with a water bottle and a phone! Michael asks, ""What did u see tell me, tell me!!!"", ""O-oh I didn't see anything just dust..."" I couldn't tell him he would have cried right there. ""Are us sure?"" Michael said, ""ye-yes, how about we play somewhere else?"" I said with a horrified face still. 
(Part 4 at 20 likes)
""If you say so!"" He replied. So we went to the living room and decided to play smt else. When I got home I was worried about Michael and had to tell my parents, so that what I did. They didn't believe me at first until I told them about what I saw in the vent. They told me ""It's your imagination! But just to make you relaxed well check in the morning, and anyway we're gonna visit him. Now go and get some rest okay! Oh ya and don't tell these rumors to Michael hell FREAK OUT!!"" ""Okay"" I said quietly. So in the morning we went to his house and my parents told his parents and when they told them, Michael's Parents looked at eachother and had a horrified face!! "" you know kids tell lies!! But well check to relief her!"" My mom said. ""Oh it's just that he's been saying that to..that there's a man living in his vent..well we though he was lying but-"" ""Oh don't worry!! It's all fake! B-but you don't believe them do you?""My parents interrupted. ""Oh u-um no.."" There parents replied with

""I think we should check now"" Michaels parents said. ""Sure let's get over with all this!😂"" My dad said. Me, Michal, Michael's parents and my parents went (me and Michaelhad to go because they ""wanted to prove that there was no one there""). When we go there we all started shivering of how cold it was. My mom decided to check so she went on Michael bed and opened the vent and saw exactly what I'd had seen but thankfully no man was there. But back to the point when she saw it she was so shocked she fell on the floor and banged her head, and passed out (I'll right the 2nd part in an hour NO LIKES NEEDED)"

"Room 209""
They found her three months after she disappeared.

Emma Calloway, 17, abducted from a gas station parking lot on a rainy Tuesday night, was discovered in the storage basement of an abandoned roadside motel, bound but alive. Malnourished. Bruised. But alive.

She was taken to the hospital, sedated, then questioned. Her answers didn’t make sense.

“He never touched me. He just watched.”
The man who kidnapped her was never found. No DNA, no fingerprints, no signs of forced entry into the motel. Yet Emma swore he came every night and stood in the corner of the room.

“He never spoke. But I heard him anyway.”
They assumed trauma. Hallucinations. Delirium.

Then the police reviewed the motel’s hidden camera footage from before the place shut down. Room 209—the one she’d been found in—had been locked and vacant for over a year before her disappearance. No bookings. No maintenance. Nothing.

But in the static-ridden security footage from the hallway camera, there were gaps. Blanks. Entire nights just... erased. Glitches.

The strange part? Whenever the footage did play, the door to Room 209 could be seen opening. Not all the way. Just enough for someone—or something—to look out.

When the police asked Emma about it, her vitals spiked. She whispered:

“It wasn’t a man.”
She wouldn’t say more.

They released her. Gave her therapy. Medication. Tried to help her adjust.

Two weeks later, she was found in her room at home.

She’d sealed the windows, barricaded the door, covered every mirror, every screen. Scrawled “DON’T LOOK AT HIM” over and over across the walls in red marker.

There was no forced entry.

No sign of a break-in.

Just her body—lifeless, pale—and the phone lying next to her.

The screen showed a blurry photo, taken in the dark.

In the corner of the room...
A tall, emaciated figure with no eyes and a cracked, gaping smile.

Facing the camera.

Watching."

Slaughter House made by LivinLikeARockstar.
Hey mom can I go to my friends house Yn says. mom says have you finished your homework yet? Yn says yes it is all done. Yns mom says then show me! Yn goes to get his homework and brings it to his mom and says here you go Yns mom looks and says excellent job Yn of course you can go to your friends house just be safe and have fun and don't stay up past 12:00 am Yns mom says. Yn says ok I wont and Yn walks to his friend's house and then realizes he forgot his phone but then he doesn't worry because he probaly won't need it anyways. Yn knocks on Andrew's door at 5:27 pm and Andrew answers the door and says welcome to the Slaughter House Andrew says. Yns laughs with Andrew and says funny joke Andrew. Andrew laughs with him to. Andrew says my mom is gone with her Girlfriends and my Dad works a night shift so we can stay up all night and watch movies and eat popcorn i bought some movie candy he says and shows me the bucket full of candy. Yn smiles and says come on we need to stop wasting our time at this door and have some fun Yn says and runs into the house. About an hour later Jimmy Kate Lance  and Cindy came over and Andrew asked if we wanted to play hide and seek in the dark because it was almost dark out. We all agreed to playing Hide and seek in the dark we all played rock paper scissors to see who was Seeker and the Seeker was Cindy. So Yn decided to hide under Andrews parents bed and Jimmy decided to hide in the shed in the backyard and Kate decided to hide in the Attic and 
Lance decided to hide in the basement Cindy counted to 40 and when she was done counting we heard her scream ready or not here I come. And then about 5 minutes later Yn heard a loud scream and at first Yn thought nothing about it until Yn saw some shoes like leather boots walk past the hallway of Andrews house and Yn remembered Cindy having leather boots but Yn didn't remember her shoes being that big but Yn thought nothing about it and then kept playing waiting for Cindy to find all of them. About 50 minutes later it was starting to get pretty dim outside the time was now 7:39 pm and the last sound Yn heard was Cindy screaming and after that it was pure silent the rest of the time. About 30 minutes later the time was now 7:58 and Yn started to get inpatient. But then Yn heard the back door opening and the basement door open and heard Jimmy and Lance's voice say we are done playing I've been hiding for to long Jimmy says and Lance says agreed. Yn gets out his hiding spot to and goes to Jimmy and Lance and says where's Kate and Cindy?? Yn says Jimmy says I remember Kate hiding in the Attic and i didn't hear or see Cindy the whole time Jimmy says Lance says I heard a loud scream upstairs tho and Yn says I did to and I saw some Leather boots that looked really big but I thought it was just a  misunderstanding and it was just Cindy. Jimmy says hey where's Andrew to Lance says oh he is in that closet right behind you. Yn opens the closet and says to Andrew the game is over now can you go get Kate from the Attic and We'll try to find Cindy. Andrew says I ain't going into that Attic by myself can Lance come with me?? Andrew says. Lance says sure and Yn says Jimmy let's go find Cindy Jimmy says ok and follows right behind Yn. About 27 minutes later the time was now 6:35 pm and we didn't have no luck to find Cindy but when we went back we saw Andrew and Lance and I looked and saw Kate's body in Andrews hands and Andrew said call 911 to Yn and I look at him with a flushed face and says I forgot it. Andrew goes pale and says You What! Yn said i forgot it why don't you have a phone? Yn says. Andrew says because my parents said I have to be 14 Andrew says Andrew then says turn around to Yn and Jimmy and we turn around and see.

"This is real⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️my mother told me this

When I was 2 or 3 I cried in the night my mother and Vader said wat is wrong I cried more and more and I started at the corner of the kitchen and pointed to that spot and I saw that and my parents not 
This happened with my grandma too"
"Ok so I have had a lot of things happen to me but nothing like this.
When I was younger my mom trusted me to walk around the neighborhood as I had a decent amount of friends I liked to go play with.
I was around eight when on my way home
This guy around 27 I’m guessing looked at me and waved me over mind you I was a sweet little girl so I waked over when I walked over there was a bottle of hand sanitizer under his car he asked me to get it for him so I looked at him and told him I’d be right back because my mom loved gardening at the time and so she had these long green stick things you would put into the garden to help the plants grow straight up I told him I would go grab one of those he turned a bit red but said ok and I started walking I grabbed it and headed back my mom seemed pretty uncomfortable when I told her what I was doing but my house was just a little bit away from the car so she new to not worry me but keep a eye when I got back I used it to get the hand sanitizer out from under the car but I didn’t realize the back seat door was opened and every time I would go to get it he moved closer to me than before I jumped up a little bit uncomfortable by the situation as he was right next to me at this point the reason why this scares me so much is because he was a grown man who could have moved his car or got it himself and it’s nothing paranormal and if I hadn’t been smart enough to grab that garden tool I could’ve got kidnapped.
Please be safe yall ♥️
And sorry it wasn’t one sentence 😭"
"“The Birthday in the Basement”

It was supposed to be a surprise party.

I turned 14 that year, and my cousin Jade told me she had something “epic” planned. She blindfolded me in the car, told me to trust her, and we drove for what felt like hours—even though her house was only ten minutes away.

When the car stopped, she helped me out and whispered, “Don’t take off the blindfold yet.” Her hand was cold. Too cold.

We walked down what felt like steps—echoing ones. Concrete. My gut twisted.

When the blindfold came off, we were in her basement.

Sort of.

There were streamers and balloons, but they were… wrong. Torn. Burned around the edges. The balloons weren’t floating; they sagged, covered in black, dripping slime. A cake sat in the middle of the room—gray, cracked, with thirteen black candles instead of fourteen.

“Jade?” I said.

She just stared at me. Her head tilted too far, her smile stretched too wide. And then, the lights went out.

Pitch black.

The silence was heavy. Then came a sound I’ll never forget: whispering. Hundreds of voices, layered and echoing, like they were crawling under my skin. I turned to run, but something grabbed my ankle. Cold, wet fingers. I kicked and screamed, crawling up the stairs, but the steps never ended—they just kept going, like I was climbing forever.

And then I was back in the basement.

Same spot.

Same cake.

Except this time, there were only twelve candles.

I screamed for help. No one came. Jade was gone. In her place stood a girl with no eyes, her mouth stitched shut. She pointed to the cake.

A voice hissed behind me: “Make a wish.”

I ran.

Somehow, I made it out. Stumbled into the daylight. My parents were there, confused, saying they’d been looking for me for hours—but we were still in Jade’s driveway. I told them what happened. They just stared at me.

“There’s no basement in Jade’s house,” they said.

And when I looked in the mirror that night, there was a streak of soot across my cheek—and a faint black candle mark burned into the back of my hand.

I never found out what really happened.
I never celebrated my birthday again.
And sometimes, at 3:14 a.m., I still hear it:
“Make a wish.”

Want it to continue? Or want a version where someone doesn’t make it out?

You said:
Continue it
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely—here’s the continuation of “The Birthday in the Basement.”

Part 2: Thirteen Candles

After that day, I stopped talking about what happened. My parents thought I was just shaken up—maybe hallucinating, maybe too much sugar and sleep deprivation. I let them believe that.

But I couldn’t stop seeing it.

The mark on my hand—that faint burn shaped like a candle—it never went away. Some nights, it glows, faint and red, especially when the clock strikes 3:14 a.m. The exact time I escaped the basement.

Or thought I did.

Three nights after the party, I started dreaming of the girl again—the eyeless one with the stitched mouth. In the dream, she walks toward me slowly, her head twitching at unnatural angles, her hand outstretched. Every time, she gets a little closer. Every time, I wake up screaming, sweat freezing cold, as if I’ve just climbed out of ice water.

And then, Jade disappeared.

Her parents filed a missing person report. Last seen at the library, but never came home. No one could find her phone. No notes. No clues.

I didn’t tell them what I knew. Who would believe me? That she took me to a basement that doesn’t exist? That she changed—became something else?

The next night, I made a mistake.

I stayed up until 3:14 a.m.

And when the clock struck, every candle in the house lit itself. I don’t even own that many candles. But they were there, flickering silently, their flames black and motionless.

In the hallway mirror, my reflection was smiling.

I wasn’t.

Then the girl appeared again—this time, not in a dream.

She was standing at the end of the hall, head tilted, stitched mouth trembling. And behind her… stood others. Blurred faces. Burned party hats. Shadowed children, all frozen in mid-scream.

I stepped back.

The girl pointed at me again. But this time, I understood.

There were twelve candles left.

One for each year. One for each victim. And now… she wanted mine.

To Be Continued..."
To fake bro!

"⚠️FAKE STORY ⚠️ 


  Once there was a girl named June she was an only child and lived with her two parents, which were both quiet. One day she was sitting in her room reading a book it was about a girl with a huge family. She had really wanted a big family. She had wanted an older sibling and a younger sibling as she wanted to be the middle child however by now she knew that it was pointless to ask her parents for another sibling because by the time they were they were six she would already be 18 since she was 12. Her parents weren’t home and she saw that the new neighbours were moving in she knew her parents wouldn’t want her to go outside while she was alone though it seemed that it was a nice family with a boy about her age and two parents so she went outside and locked the door from the inside when she close the door she ran over and said hello. The boy seemed nice and asked if she wanted to go to the park with him since he didn’t want to stay and help his parents unpack lamps and such. She agreed that she had nothing else to do. she decided to go straight there since she already had her comfy sweatpants on and a black T-shirt, the boy wore a orange T-shirt, however he had shorts on. June felt the weather and wondered why he had chose to wear shorts in this weather. It was cloudy but not wet a bit windy and a little bit cold since it was fall. She asked his name and he replied Daniel. They began to walk to the park together. It was a Friday and she asked him what school he was going to go to. He said he was homeschooled and she said she was too. She asked him whether he had enjoyed homeschool or not. He replied that he didn’t really care and that it wasn’t that big of a deal to him. June had never really liked school so she just not in her head but didn’t say anything. They were almost at the park when I got even colder which was strange because the Weather iPad showed that it would not get much colder. Already it wasn’t that cold just tilting slightly to the colder side but now it was just cold. The wind got a bit more intense too. Then they arrived at the park. And Daniel avoid the drain next to the sidewalk just as June had they both laughed. And June admitted that ever since she was little she had always been terrified that it would just break. Daniel admitted that he had the same fear too. There were not much children at the park as it was too cold for the parents to sit on the bench and not move around. They jumped from slide to slide a bit, but it wasn’t that much fun so they decided to walk.Aroung the side walk when they saw the drain on the other side was open. June dared Daniel to jump into it as a joke however he took it seriously and jumped in. You should come in too it’s pretty cool down here, Daniel. So June hopped in even if she knew it wasn’t the wisest decision. LOOK! He said there’s a tunnel let’s follow it that didn’t seem like much of a great idea to June but she did it anyways. Are you sure we should be doing this? Daniel replied with a no, but it doesn’t matter that much. All of the sudden the wind got way stronger and Daniel started to feel sleepy. He collapsed in the middle of the tunnel and laid down June freaked out and she started to crawl to the other side of the tunnel back up the drain however she started to feel sleepy too. She heard a weird scratching that noise. And then fell asleep.

 Part 2
June was the 1st to wake up and when she woke up, it was dark outside she’s checked her watch which was one only for seeing the time not for calling or anything like that it showed 1 am terrified she shook Daniel awake. He woke up and they both crawled to the end of the tunnel where they had entered, however it was shut. She was terrified so was Daniel. They both banged on it and called for help. It was no use no one could hear them anyways they ran into the other side of the tunnel and they were midway there when they saw footsteps on the other side however these footsteps did not seem normal and the feet at the other side didn’t either. They started to crawl back as fast as they can as they saw it tipped down and crawl into the hole however their theory was proved correct. It was not a human although it it did sort of look like one although it was just a black figure.  Then something terrified happened it was crawling super fast and almost catching up to them. They ran out and and banged on the exit but it didn’t open so they went to the next tunnel. It almost was there when they saw that this one was open however there was no ladder to get up. Daniel held up June and and she crawled onto the ground. She turned around quickly and helped pull up Daniel. The dark figure grabbed Daniel‘s foot and his shoe fell off however he jumped up with his arms onto the ground and shut the drain door both of them ran to June’s house as they saw that the figure had opened the door of the drain. She yanked to handle to her house however then she remembered she had locked it. She yanked the key out of her pocket and then open the door as quick as she could. She ran inside thinking Daniel would shut the door however the figure was catching up to them and for some reason he didn’t. He got inside the house in June pulled him the stairs as he tripped along to cat toys on the ground. June‘s parents for some reason they weren’t at home they got up the stairs and the figure was catching up to them. He was super fast. June pulled him into her room and shut the door and locked it and then they were scraping on the door and then a familiar smell from the drain came up and both of them started to feel sleepy again however both of them understood what it was doing and how it was going to make them fall asleep and come in. She pulled him into her secret hideout that her dad had built for her in her closet she shut and used the lock she had bought at a store when she was young that she thought was cool and put her onto it. She close the lock knowing that she had no idea where the key was. They both started to fall sleepy and they both fell asleep when they woke up. It was already morning. She gonna hear her parents and sirens the distance and knew they must be looking for them looking at the small peep hole that was built in the mini door disguise as the wall she saw her room. It was a mess as she assumed the creature was searching for them. Daniel woke up soon and it was a day before they found them. Both children told the police exactly about the monster that they had seen however they did not believe them and thought they must be hallucinating or something or just making it up. 

      Three days later they were found in Daniel’s backyard severely injured however it was not just them that was injured. All of the towns children were severely injured and extremely close to death that early morning when they were found luckily none of them were dead and when the police ask them who did that they all describe the same thing."
"So, my parents have always told me to NEVER go into the creepy woods in our neighborhood, and I never knew exactly why... 
But one time, my best friend and I, went on a bike ride around noon. It was starting to thunder, so we were about to head inside. But then, my friend thought it would be a good idea to go into the woods that everyone told me NOT to go into. I told her it was a bad idea, but she said we would only go in for a little while. I guess I just kinda agreed, and went along with it. But it started to thunder more and more, as we walked deeper into the woods. I told her we should head back home, and she said, ""okay, fine."" but, as we turned around to walk back home, we realized we were lost in the sketchy woods..... 
As we just continued to walk back home trying to find our way back, (this is were the scary parts happen....) 
I heard a little giggle that sounded like a little girl... I asked my best friend if she heard anything, and she said she didn't hear anything. Then, I just kept hearing the giggle come closer and closer. I was getting scared, but my friend didn't believe me. As we kept walking, she said she wanted to take a selfie with me and her in the woods to send to her other friend, (I have no idea why) I just said, ""ok"" and we took the selfie. As she sent it to her friend, her friend replied with, ""Ummm.... Girls...?"" my friend just replied with a, ""yeah..???"" my best friends friend, then sent the same selfie we sent to her, with a red circle around a little girl, in a white gown, with black long hair, standing behind us, hiding behind a tree…. Me and my best friend were so terrified... We called her and asked if she edited that. But as we checked the photo, we knew it wasn't edited....... something was really behind us as we took that photo….

As we rushed out of the woods.... (we finally knew the way back home) And made it home safely... I then understood why my parents said to never go into the woods..... 
Ever since that day, I could almost feel like the woods was telling me to NEVER come back.....

"Long story so get comfy so there once was a girl named Leah and she was 10 years old and she was in fifth grade one night. She was all home alone with four friends over and her dad had some pizza money and gave it to her. They ordered pizza sat down on the floor got comfy and put on Lilo and stitch because they were gonna have a party that night when Lilo and stitch was over. They watched Lilo and stitch too and Lilo and stitch. She decided to put on squid game and binge watch it then after that, they said the animal and started to have a party. They pulled it all nighter. They stayed up all night. Leah decided to tell one of her friends Heather a secret so whole friend group decided to go in the circle and tell the secret only Carly and her knew about it so they told the secret and they kept it so they finished squid game and had a party as you know after their party, they went out they went out to the park talk around look up trees and them, but dad left his credit card and they went to the mall he he told them you can go to the mall with this money so they went to the mall went shopping they decided to stay past midnight the next day they ended up falling asleep and then they decided to grab stuff over the mall they went to the food court for breakfast and then after that they started shopping around the mall when they were done they left, but when they were going home. They felt like they were being followed, and if you’re wondering, why were they driving and they’re only 10 years old well the older sister was taking them places they were driving home. They decided to make four left turns car still behind. They still felt like they were getting followed. After that they said they nothing to do about it, but when they looked around their car was not there they thought it was their imagination, but then they heard noises and then started playing, but they hadn’t turned on the radio or put any songs on on their phone. They were very scared and they thought maybe this could happen because we stayed up late night went to bed and their parents went out on a trip so they were staying the rest of the month and that month just got started. This is a very, very, very long story, like an hour long, so get very c so after that, they said oh my gosh, I’m terrified Aaliyah had to calm her down. Amelia went to go get. She went to the back of the car and got her inhaler because when she usually got scared usually is not very OK so they get her inhaler because she usually can’t breathe well when she’s very scared because she is like freaking out so her heller makes her feel better after that when they got there was a random car in there parking lot but they turned around to go get something like a shovel to bury. It’s a breakable car as soon as they saw the car was gone so they got very scared. They went into the car and drove off and then all the kids were playing Roblox the other sister was also their friend group and she was the oldest one because she was about. She was 17. You know what happened after that well this is very scary, they saw a bird bird before you blink. It was gone as fast as a second faster than a second faster than one second like zero seconds it was gone. They looked in the first split second it was gone. It was very scary for them, but then after that, they left it alone, terrifying as they were driving, they kept hearing taps under window, not tapping like knocking like it was very loud like pure loud, but they looked well. The knocking was there and they saw no one the middle of nowhere when they were driving on the interstate drove to the middle of nowhere and by the way guys is not true so I said true story then I apologize story is not true, the life if you are find yourself in the middle of nowhere, you are not your world anymore. Follow the rules and that’s exactly what happens. They were terrified. They were walking out and started walking. after that, they found some random people. They remembered the lights don’t pay attention to these people and here are the rules. I’ll tell you the video if you are ever walking if you are ever on the interstate and then you suddenly park in the middle of nowhere not in your world anymore, but follow these rules. I mean if you are ever driving in the sky suddenly blue and you park in the middle of nowhere if you ever walk in if you are driving one day and then you suddenly park in the middle of nowhere and the sky is green then you’re not in your world anymore. The follow the rules people do not try to talk to them they are and they are not see them run not trying to be your friend. You’ll come across the cat go climb up back to the world but don’t go on it if it has one leg no leg short so it’ll lead you back till they follow the steps and then they led back to the real world every night when they fell asleep they were hearing this weird noise on our window or tapping so then they go see what it is, just nightmare

"🎬 Title: “Do Not Watch This Tape”

Genre: Paranormal Horror / Found Footage
Setting: Suburban house – eerie and quiet.
Format: Script-style, like a short film or YouTube horror short.

⸻

FADE IN:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark room. Only lit by the blue glow of a laptop.
JASON (19) is setting up a small webcam. There’s an old VHS tape on his desk.

JASON (into camera):
Okay, so I bought this tape at a garage sale for a buck. No label. Old as hell. The guy said, “Don’t watch it after midnight.” So obviously, we’re doing exactly that.

He laughs nervously. Checks the time.
12:17 AM.

He puts the tape into an old TV/VCR combo. The screen flickers. White static. Then—

ON TV:
A home video of a family from the 90s. Two kids playing. A man filming. A woman cooking.

Suddenly, the footage distorts.
A loud screech. The image skips to a STATIC FRAME of a dark figure standing in a hallway — barely visible.

JASON (nervous laugh):
Okay… creepy. But not that creepy.

TV goes black.

Jason leans in. The tape ejects itself.

JASON:
Weird.

Suddenly — all the lights go out.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jason lights a candle. Talks into his phone camera now, filming for a vlog.

JASON:
Power’s out. I swear it wasn’t storming. This is like every cursed tape cliché.

Something moves behind the shower curtain.
He turns. Listens. Silence.

He slowly pulls the curtain—
Nothing. But behind him, something flickers in the mirror — a face?

He turns. No one’s there.

⸻

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jason walks slowly. The hallway is dim. His phone light flickers.

He hears a faint whisper — his name.

VOICE (soft):
…Jason…

JASON:
(whispers)
Hello?

He opens the closet door. It’s empty.
When he turns back—

The VHS tape is now on the hallway floor. He gasps.

⸻

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Jason sets up the camera again, shaking. He plugs the tape back in.

JASON:
This is messed up. I just wanna record it so people know I’m not losing it.

He hits play.

ON TV:
This time, the footage is… his house. Filmed from outside his window.
Then inside. Someone filming him asleep. Slowly approaching.

Jason steps back in horror.

ON TV:
The camera turns to face a mirror — revealing a tall figure with no face behind the lens.

TV screen flickers. Then:

YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE WATCHED.

A loud CRASH from behind. Jason spins the camera—

The figure is in the room now.

Camera falls.

BLACK SCREEN.

⸻

TEXT ON SCREEN:

Authorities found Jason’s camera the next morning.
The tape? Never recovered.
Some say if you watch his final upload…
You become the next tape.

END."

To me so I had just got the attention because I broke my pencil, I broke the glasses. Mom so I just went to bed when I got home I wasn’t hungry and then after that I seen my best friend on the floor. It was strange because when I went to bed at night, I didn’t invite her over. I hear hi can I say what are you doing here? I didn’t invite you over. Do you want to play Roblox and I’m like it’s too late. You need to go home and go back to bed or you can sleep here if you want whatever your choices and she’s like please play Roblox with me and like play Roblox on your own then she says, but I want to play with you. I wanna play with and I’m like no go home play Roblox or play Roblox here or you can go home and go to bed. I don’t even know why you’re up and like and then she says please. please and I say no I’m not playing Roblox with you. It’s not usually asked me to play Roblox and I said no she’s like all right that’s fine and I’m like yeah maybe later she was begging me so I thought I was dreaming, but I wasn’t. She was tired or maybe she was sleepwalking she wouldn’t sleepwalking but maybe she just wanted to play with me or someone told her to come over to my house but not but that was not the case so she was like fine and left the room. She slammed freaking door so loud it woke my parents up and my baby sister started crying and slam the door so freaking loud loud too that someone thought that was robber night. I woke up in the morning, I was terrified my best friend comes over, why did you keep begging me to play Roblox last night like what are you talking about? Come over and I’m like yes you did. You were lying on my bedroom floor and said play Roblox and you said the door so freaking loud that my parents go here you woke them up. She says I did not think that I would never do that to you. That’s so mean, I never ever do that. I would never beg you to play Roblox you don’t I just sit there on my face I saw you and she’s like well. Maybe you were just dreaming or sleepwalking I said I hope so and I’m like I don’t sleep so maybe it was just draining so that we walk to school together again I go to bed that night and see her laying on the floor. You wanna play Roblox and like OK now I know it’s you go to bed get out of my house now. This is my house and you can’t just invite you over yourself overand she like slams the door so freaking loud again and slams the front door so freaking loud again and I’m like now I know it’s definitely you. I saw you last night. What are you doing? and then my BFF says now I know you were streaming you keep saying I saw you. I saw you laying on my floor and I’m like you’re right. I’m probably just dreaming that night go back to bed and it happens again she’s laying on my floor facing up to me and saying, and I keep telling her go get your get out of my house now or I’m gonna call the cops this time. She slams the door lightly and finally slams of that dang door. She’s been slamming so freaking loud got my waking my parents up and waking the baby up and then she comes over for breakfast and I tell her the next time you do this I’m going to call the police on you and she’s like whoa whoa whoa whoa you keep coming in my house without permission. The next time you do it I’m calling a dang cops on you and like you and then it happened again. I looked over my bed, saw her laying on the floor saying you want to play Roblox and I’m like I’m gonna call the police. I grab my phone press the button 911 and the cops but they say sorry we can’t talk right now in bed and then they hang up on freaking phone. I’m like you got lucky this time get out of my house this time I’m eating dinner. I look on the floor and I see her say hey play Roblox I scream get out of my house or I’m actually gonna call the cops on you, I’m like this is so strange and then I want to happen again and you may be wondering when it’s gonna get to part well you just gotta wait to see what happens so I see her laying there but she asked me a question this time do you want to use ChatGPT and I say get out of my house now that night the next night I slept in my parents room. I saw my best friend on the floor so then that night I decide to look at her hair and she always wears a ponytail with a bun and I’m like you’re not my best friend get out of my house now before I call the cops she doesn’t get out. She just leaves and she just get out actually get I thought that night didn’t happen. I thought boy boy oh boy I should’ve never ever been relieved it got scary so she asked me she comes over and I’m like no I’m in class and tapping the end of my desk at the end of the table, but I’m only one who can hear it my friend you hear nothing because I said I can hear a tapping noise when I get home I am terrified because I didn’t know what it was my best friend asked me again. Do you wanna play Roblox and I’m like fine we play Roblox idiot computer and I look at her computer. Her username is code 1001 in this kind of scared me and and then I woke up and I’m like her name on Roblox is explorer Elizabeth hacker so a hacker has been coming in my house and that my Roblox account got hacked but this is not the end of the story. My mom says go to bed. It’s so so late the girl playing Roblox with mom. She’s a hacker. My parents called the police and she gets arrested, I remember looking down and she said do you wanna play Roblox and scream so so so loud my mom comes running to my room and says are you OK and I say the girl that got arrested is laying on the floor and then after that she says come sleep in our room so then after that room and she’s like don’t follow her I’m gonna call the police on you and you’re gonna get arrested I’m like so scared like oh my gosh, she followed me. My mom says you’re OK baby I’m like. so then my mom says school time in the morning so I had to school and I’m like OK. Hope this doesn’t happen again. I remember at lunch. I looked down at the table because usually I like to feed my dog because usually there’s some little cause usually I drop some crumbs and I was just saying if I drop any and then I see her laying down, like who is that explore Elizabeth that she was banned from Roblox and I still had her as a friend I tried to unfriend her but I couldn’t. She would not unfriend and I couldn’t block her either so I was terrified. I’m like oh my gosh, what am I gonna do so I find it, a pan and a water bottle story doesn’t end here a big metal shovel. At least my dad‘s toolbox and his toolbox is made out of metal so that night when I went to bed, I saw her hit her over the head and she never ever came back and that is the end of the story in the story was not real end of story. Hope you enjoyed it but 10 likes and I’ll say what happened after part two"
"FAKE OR NOT STORY


One time when i was little like 6 yrs or smth i was at my friends house ODDLY late.. but i didnt think abt it that much bcz we both got permission that i'd be there so we wanted to play in the trampo outside in there backyard but then it was getting pretty dark.. but we only got tired and stayed in the trampo eating food cuz we were hungry aswell but theyre neighbour was weird so sometimes we would hear screaming and yh. So when we were getting tired then we set up a sleepover spot in the trampo and slept there but we werent getting tired so then i wanted to play in the playground next to theyre house, QUICK NOTE THAT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA there was some ppl having a argument in theyre house and we noticed something weird. That house had odd dreamcore vibes but then u turned around and a skinwalker was BEHIND me. But thankfully it was js a dream, when i woke up i was nowhere in my friends nor my own house. I was in a forest all alone but when i woke up i saw this scary mf infront of me STARING AT ME SMILIING ODDLY i was scared obviously but i realised i wasnt alone anymore, i lived close to that forest but my parents were in my backyard cutting grass and left the door open, i was taking a nap but then i sleepwalked, my parents didnt even notice i was gone, i was js laying there scared,that man hit my head with a metal bat, i passed out and he dragged me to his car i was in his trunk ans opend it while it was driving but it wasnt driving so fast so i jumped off from that point i fell and hit my head on a metal sign then later my parents saw me around 30 mins after, he soon got arrested and i was scared to fall asleep near a open door ever since.




























































































Can u solve the mystery if its a fake story or not?"
"One day their was a girl home alone when her parents went to go to a party and said they would come back at midnight and she had her dog to comfort her so when she was getting ready to go to bed she put her hand below the bed where her dogs sleeps she the dog can lick her and then she heard dripping from the bathroom but she to herself “I’ll just tell mom and dad when they get back home” and she shook her hand out again she couldn’t sleep bc of the dripping so without a second thought she went to check the bathroom and instead of water dripping it was her dog dead hanging and the blood dripping when she went back to her room scared she found a note that said “humans can lick too” 

btw idk if it’s a real story but I think it is and I’m just glad it’s not me who had this happen"
One day I was walking to my room and right when I walked in the picture of my dead cat fell down. I had a chill running down my spine knowing he actually died in that room.

❗️you barely survived 
❌️ you didn't survive

 A family wanted to go on vacation. It was a long trip. But they couldn't get there because their car broke down. The dad went looking for any building where they could stay. Later he came back and said he found a gas station. They pushed the car to the gas station. 
1. stay at the gas station but hide
2. stay at the gas station but start looking for people 
3. keep going without the car 


✅️you successfully survived the night because you found food. 
❗️you barely survived because an old man looked at you and started running after you 
❌️you didn't survive because you didn't eat anything
 
It's morning but you've run out of water. You'll die of thirst by evening if you don't find anything. 
1.go into the building alone 
2.tell the others to go together 
3.stay in the car maybe you'll find something else in the backpacks
 

❗️the old man noticed you again but you ran away 

✅️you found some food together and the man left because he was scared of you  

❌️you starved to death.

Now you bravely entered the building because you saw the old man leave. But when you were about to fix the car and went in to get the tools, you hear a clanking sound from a room. 
1. You look at what it is
 2. You ignore it
 3. You lock yourself in the car with the others. 

❌️The old man didn't leave and kidnapped you 
❗️You left the house and continued fixing with what you had
 ✅️The man didn't follow you because he didn't know where you were.

"⚠️ Fake Story (some parts are true) ⚠️

So, one day at my school, it was a rainy day, and we had a fire drill. It wasn't a normal fire drill though. When we got outside, it wasn't normal rain. The rain was a dark purplish color. The teachers told us to go inside that there was a warning that had randomly popped up on their phones. (The National Weather Service has issued a severe rain color saturation. Please seek shelter in 5 minutes MAX or you will be ki- *disconnection*) So, we assumed it wasn't that bad since they didn't tell us anything. Then, the rain stopped abruptly. The teachers told us to hide in the closets, but we didn't know why. One kid ran outside and was DISSOLVED. yeah, you heard that right. LITERALLY DISSOLVED. Then, I was blacked out. I finally woke up after 1 hour and I was in a hospital bed. I overheard a conversation about severe Uranium radiation being expelled from my body. Then I woke up at home. BUT then, I get a strange ghost/spiritual feeling in my living room. I walk over there, and MY CLOTHES BASKET LITERALLY FELL OVER. And I passed out. I hear about some random kids that are in my school that have gone missing. I was one of them. I show up the next day and everyone was happy. Then, I straight up die from radiation. Then I wake up. IT WAS ALL A DREAM!!"
"Alr alr lemme try making a scary story btw this is fake

If you ever hear the fire alarm go off in your school and nobody reacts to it stay calm, they are no longer human, you cant let them know you are human. Second: when the alarm is done go up to your teacher and ask if you can go to the restroom, and dont show a sign of any stress. Third: if a student asks you about the alarm in the hallway don’t say anything about it, they are trying to reveal that you are human…


I hope that was creepy"

"Me and my sister watched a youtube video and decided to do a seance, We didnt have anything fancy and we were really young so we just used a random word generator and a single candle, We got some spooky stuff and thought nothing of it, That was until that nught when we were in bed and from our kitchen we heard a noise, a random long-winded holler, Keep in mind that our brother, other aister and mum were upstairs asleep, We heard nobody go down the stairs and nobody go back up, After that it didnt get better, Whenever we turned on the frontroom lights and watched something mildly paranormal it would flicker, never when we werent."
"True story but short.
						It was night we we’re coming from a haunted hotel that we have ghost hunted. As we were going down the road we saw a dog in the middle of the road the eyes were huge we honked and it want move so we’re and to drive in the grass and almost got stuck as we moved the dog turned around with one paw so we started driving faster and made it to the house. As we were going to the house I was watching a video of SKINWALKERS and the often make them selfs look like a animal."

So me and a couple other friends of mine stayed the night at another friends place, it was.

I said we shouldn’t do that but they did it anyway. I felt like we were being watch  I told my bestie she felt the same way I looked ove at the corn and I saw to glowing eyes I told everyone they said they were feeling watched.

"When I was little I always saw dark figures around my house, normal just imaginary, then I start seeing a cat , I always saw it, then a few weeks later my mom got a call from my dads work saying they found kittens and asked us to take them home to try finding a shelter and keeping maybe one or two, when we get home, one died, after that cat died I never saw that figure, next figure was a tall person, same year, someone from my school died I haven’t seen many figures since but this is a odd coincidence 



Next story(made up)(kinda)

So I was little maybe six or seven and at night I always told myself again and again “ no bad dreams, don’t get sick “ every night I didn’t say it I had a nightmare, that’s not super creepy but a few nights when I wouldn’t have a nightmare I looked out my window and always saw a dark figures around, they would be hold something when they looked around I always ducked down cuz I thought I could be murdered and when I looked back up it was gone but I always the next morning saw something in the road.

Lyla, Going through hard times ,21
Mia,has paranoia,8
Sophia,has a sister,23 as well
Niome,brave is suppose sister,22
~Story Time
One day Mia was drawing when she heard a noise. She thought it was her paranoia,so she moved in. Well then she saw something at the corner of her eye,it tapped her shoulder and started to control her drawing. When she was done it was this creature it made her draw it looked like the blur from her vision.
~Part Two~ She didn't know the creature so she called niome. The bravest in their group and face timed her. So when she got on camera she said ""Hey could I show you something its kind weird?"" Niome said sure and Mia showed her the creepy picture. She said ""Oh god its come back"" ~Part Three~ She hung up the phone. A few hours later no-one texted and said""I'm sorry I couldn't see that thing again."" And Mia asked about it and Niome told her about it and had to tell miss avery. Mia asked""Why her?"" Niome said""she used to be a paranormal person who noticed these type of things. ""  ~Part Four~ The next day they asked her, Her face went pale. She told them all about the creature once more and said they had to warn Shopia. When Niomd got home she told her about it. So they all had a group chat and said to hide in their closet once they got home from school. They did their normal routine. But then Lyla said ""I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick."" So everyone said okay we will chat. Well then Lyla wouldn't respond. So they just thought she had a accident and had to clean up~Part Five~ so with all this talk about bathrooms Niome had to go super bad so she said she will be right back. Of course everyone knew her bathroom was far away so everyone always expected that she just had a accident like Lyla. Shopia just couldn't literally do it any longer so of course for some reason SHE HAD TO GO NOW. And  Mia and Ms.Avery didn't know why they still expected the others to had a accident. Everyone knew Shopia was good at holding it in. BUT FOR SOME REASON. She couldn't hold it like go now or else your gonna pee right then and there.~Part Six~ well OF COURSE now both Ms.Avery and Mia HAD TO PEE so they were like. ""Im not having a accident neither am I going to go missing so they tried to chat but Mia HAD TO GO so bad she was like hey I .. Can't hold .. It so then she couldn't hold it so they just decided to go there but of holding it so long miss Avery was like actually im not peeing myself right now but she just bursted. But she saw a distorted figure in front of her and the same for Mia and they died ~The End~"
"The house stood alone on a hill, overlooking a town that felt miles away, even though it was just at the base of the winding road. A thick fog clung to the surrounding woods, muffling the world and making it feel impossibly isolated. Sarah had chosen this house for its quiet, its distance from the noise and demands of the city. But now, the silence felt less like peace and more like a vacuum waiting to be filled.
The first night was unsettling. A faint, repetitive thudding echoed from the walls, a sound she couldn't pinpoint. It wasn’t a rodent or a pipe knocking; it had a strange, deliberate rhythm to it. She tried to rationalize it – the old house settling, perhaps. But the sound persisted, a constant, unsettling pulse in the otherwise silent air.
As days turned into a week, the thudding grew louder, closer. It seemed to be originating from the wall behind her bed. Sleep became a luxury she couldn't afford. The constant thudding, combined with the feeling of being watched, kept her on edge. She'd catch glimpses of movement in her peripheral vision, shadows that lingered too long, and felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck.
One evening, as she was about to investigate the wall, the thudding stopped abruptly. The sudden silence was even more terrifying than the noise. She stood frozen, listening to her own racing heart, the quiet amplifying every tiny creak of the old house. A whisper, barely audible, brushed against her ear, ""I know you're awake"". 😏"

So skinwalkers are creatures that shapeshift into random things that people need and use  to survive. Or adopt and things like that. Then they turn into their normal forms and eat you."

So my guts told me to act like the gas station employee that was bored as hell and watching TikTok’s so I said “dad when is your shift ending” and whispered “ act along he’s following me I’m scared” so he said “I’m about to end baby” and the employee went to “help out” the creepy man and he asked him to leave if you not gonna get anything. So I was relieved. Now I’m 23 years old and he’s 25 years old and we are getting married soon.🎉🎉🎉"

THE END my fingers hurt but anyway"
"True story
So when I woke up from my nap I saw my mom in my closet getting to get something
It looked like her so I sad “mommy” and she disappeared 
And I started crying because I wanted my mom
When that happened I turned my head and then my mom came in asking me if I wanted some ice cream
And I said yes but it still left me wonder what was in my closet 
It happened last year and I think it’s a Wendigo, skinwalker, doppelgänger, or a mimic
Let me know ur thoughts in the replies!"
"Title: The Girl in the Shadows

In the small town of Hollow Creek, stories of the past lingered like fog on a chilly morning. Among them, the tale of the girl in the shadows haunted every corner. Rumors circulated about a girl named Elara, who had lived in an old, decaying house at the edge of the woods. She was said to have been beautiful once, with long, flowing hair and a smile that could light up the darkest days. But that was before the accident—a night when the moon hid behind storm clouds and darkness swallowed the world whole.

After that fateful night, Elara was never seen the same way again. Whispers spoke of how she had changed, her eyes dimmed as shadows wrapped around her like a shroud. They said she wandered through the trees, her laughter echoing eerily in the wind, only to fade into the eerie silence that followed.

One crisp autumn evening, a group of friends dared each other to visit the old house. Driven by a mix of curiosity and bravado, they grabbed flashlights and set off, unaware that their adventure would turn into something far beyond their imagination.

As they approached the house, it loomed in the fading light, a skeletal structure with windows like darkened eyes. Ivy clung to the walls, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. The chill in the air nipped at their skin, but they pressed on, their laughter masking the growing unease.

Inside, the floorboards creaked beneath their weight, and dust danced in the beams of their flashlights. Everything felt wrong—like the house itself was watching them. They explored room after room until they found themselves in a dimly lit parlor, where an old mirror hung on the wall, its glass cloudy with age.

As one of the friends approached the mirror, he felt a sudden chill, as if a breath of icy air had swept past him. Staring into the depths of the glass, he gasped. There, reflected behind him, was a glimpse of something—no, someone. A girl with long, dark hair, her face partially hidden by shadows, stared back with wide, empty eyes.

“Did you see that?” he stammered, turning to his friends, but they laughed it off, dismissing it as a trick of the light. They had heard the stories, but their bravado kept them from believing.

Moments later, a soft sound interrupted their laughter—a whisper that floated through the air, murmuring unintelligibly. It grew louder, a haunting melody that seemed to echo around them. Their bravado faltered, hearts racing at the thought of what they might be conjuring. 

“We should go,” one girl urged, the unease in her voice palpable. But curiosity, mixed with fear, kept them rooted in place.

Suddenly, the temperature dropped further. Their breath misted in front of them, and a shadow darted across the wall. They turned, eyes wide, straining to see. It was then they found her—Elara. She stood in the corner, a ghostly silhouette, her eyes now glowing with an unnatural light. The whispers formed words, floating like mist in the air— ""Help me...""

Panic surged through the group. They turned to flee, but the door slammed shut, trapping them inside. Elara stepped closer, her face now visible—a haunting beauty twisted by sorrow. “You’ve come to help, haven’t you?” she said, her voice echoing as if from a great distance.

Terrified but feeling an odd pull towards her, the bravest among them stepped forward. “What do you need?” he asked, his voice trembling.

“Free me from this place,” she pleaded, “I am bound to the shadows until someone remembers me as I once was.” 

Recognizing the tragedy of her story, the friends joined hands, closing their eyes and focusing on the memories of laughter, love, and life. As they opened themselves to the warmth of those feelings, they felt the heaviness in the air begin to lift. The shadows around Elara slithered away, unraveling like threads pulled from a tapestry.

With a final, sincere smile, Elara began to fade, her form washed out by light. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice fading into a soft breeze that drifted through the room.

The door creaked open, and the friends stumbled into the night, breathless and changed. They looked back at the house, now just a structure bathed in silver moonlight, no longer ominous but peaceful. Hollow Creek would remember Elara, not as a figure of fear, but as a lost girl finally set free.

From that day on, the stories of the girl in the shadows morphed into something new—a tale of hope, connection, and the power of remembrance. Sometimes, in the depths of the woods, you could still hear her laughter, a gentle reminder to cherish the light, even in the darkest times."

"Well heres a story.. 

People included 
Olivia, Sandra, Mikael, (not their real name but their fav name) Me, Fiona and my crush

Okay im starting the story.. 

We were all in the school yard until we noticed something suspicious. It was like 8pm, it was really dark. All the lights were on tho. But one light.. Wasn't. We didint mind it for a lil bit but we noticed the lamp moving.. We ran out and when we came back the lamp was completely in a different spot. We checked the lamp more closer, it seemed like nothing was wrong. We still ran out of the yard even tho nothing was happening. We were at the car parking things. (Dont ask) and we saw a black figure standing next to the parking place. Fiona and Sandra went to check out on it... But.. There was nothing.. The guy there disappeared.. They came back like nothing happened. ""There was nothing, be careful for the trees tho.. "" Fiona said. No one knew what it meant exept me.. 

End of the story!! 

No im not telling what ""be careful of the trees"" meant.

"One day in a dark government facility there was a experiment called experiment-28A his real name was Arion he was tortured by the experiment over and over again he has beat up so much until he became immune to pain one day they found his cage busted open then they saw 2 glowing white eyes in the dark he walked out, holding a head in his hand, and the head was one of the scientist head a bunch of government agents came out and shot at him, but he dodged moving faster than light he grab one scientist and slammed his head into a computer killing the scientist then he grabbed a gun on the floor he shot one scientist brains out then he grabbed one government agent the government agent shot a miss let him, but it ended up doing nothing to Arion then Arion laughed and he said oh no you cant harm me you’ve created me to be unstoppable. Now you’re gonna pay the price with your life. Arion grabbed the gun he found and pointed at the government agent’s head and shot his head completely destroying the government agent. The government facility became a bloodbath that night he killed everybody with his bare hands and with a gun then he ran away faster than a lightning speed, leaving a red energy trail in space there was a alien except the alien who looked just like him wore black and blue clothes but Ario wore black and red clothes the aliens name was Arian It’s very similar to Arions name but I will say that for another story, but you will have to figure out how the next story will start and end goodbye for now…."

"Fake story 

   Avery and Nathan were just ordinary students at grassland high school, they were very close friends since kindergarten and they're family's were close too. But there was one thing I forgot to mention... The town they're in is very dangerous like not some crimes and stuff it's darker then that.
Avery and Nathan were walking home one day and they decided to go a short way home, as they were walking through the path they heard a unpleasant sound, ""What was that?!"" Avery said clearly alarmed ""I don't know it's very weird.."" Nathan said concerned they continued walking trying to clear their minds off if what just happened. (I'm going to stop here for now)"

"Do not read




Once I was at my house alone at bed and my mom went to a concert to see Ariana Grande. I was home alone cause I was 18 at this time. I’m now 21 and I was very scared and this and this is a real story but I heard this lady knocking on the door. I looked out the window. She had red eyes with red nails on, and I can’t believe my eyes she had blood on herself. This is a real story FYI, this real story and I cannot believe what I’m saying I was scared to death. I call my mom right away at this time I had a phone and I called my mom immediately she she was headed home by the time my brother was hiding under my bed and I was screaming for my life. I was kicking her hitting her eating fighting for my life. I was trying my best to not get caught by her. I slowly unlocked. The door went upstairs and grabbed a knife and I finally killed her but she came back alive and I didn’t know how she had powers, but I did not know how she had powers so I was like how did she do that and I was afraid so I called my mom again and she was like she’s two hours away and I was like I can. I cannot handle this 😮Mom you’re not home yet. I’m gonna die and she was like honey. I’m not I’m here. I’m almost here. Just stay calm. I said no you’re not close to being here. You’re two hours away now I called her an hour later. She’s an hour away. I called her 20 minutes later. She’s five minutes away. She finally entered here. The lady was still alive following us in the house. I was terrified. I cannot believe what I was saying my mom and dad finally finally arrived. They were having they were fighting her even cutting her even killing her. The police finally showed up and we were finally saved. FYI, this is a real story.



Don’t believe me ask my mom"

"True story!!! That was now! 

I was with my friend's my mom called me and said that I have to go home the next few days I was going out with my friend's again but something has happened the door was opened  I asked my mom if she was out and she said no I was so scared and ran into my room but when I ran into my room there was a black man standing and staring at me I ran into the kitchen to ask my mom what was going on my sister chocking on the floor and my mom just died in front of me I hadn't no choice but to call the police."

"There was a girl she who lived on the road where everybody who stepped a foot through the fence they would disappear the next day… as soon as the mom figured out about this, they moved… they say anybody who steps a foot into that place would get their head chopped off the next day by a mysterious figure… it was a white figure 4 legs two in the front in the back…. Doing a backbend.. big smile with B!00d in its mouth.. big white eyes… until one day.. a lady decided to move there. She didn’t believe any of those silly stories… she was a normal person in that town, a brave one. Was a aunt with her kid living in that house… the kid was a little nervous, but he didn’t want to admit it. Nothing ever happened.. people called her a witch for not having anything to happen to her… until one day. Two years later, something seriously happened the aunt woke up to mysterious clicking on her window. She got off really mad until she saw the thing white skin… big smile.. big eyes.. four legs… she was terrified, but she did not tell her kid about anything that night… until the kid went to school at school. Everything seem to get creepy.. whenever he was in the bathroom alone. The last stall would always open by itself, then flush by itself… everybody thought he was just illusion things, but he knew what he saw he began seeing that creepy thing”the thing” the thing his mom was seeing… until his mom woke up to banging on the door… she woke up her kid and left as“the thing” chased after them until they were dead and ran out of breath. Everybody in that town died without knowing what the thing was.         THE END. What should I name the story?"

"⚠️Don’t read One night I was outside trick-or-treating on Halloween. I was all by myself because I’m 12 and I still like to trick-or-treating I saw a man and he was a skin walker and I said man why are you so annoying me that you’re just creepy and then he started running at me, but on all force, he was running like a kind of like a dog, but really weirdly and he was really creepy and he was well all black and white. He had had a pointy nose and he looks like he kinda had cancer. He had a little bit of hair and it was just really creepy and then I started right when I started running faster as fast as I can. He caught up to me he grabbed my legs and she pulled me and she tried to kill me and it was just very scary and that resolver army of them and once I got away, I started running running running and running, but he kept trying to get me. He was still on all fours and I was running it and I was running and I tried to run in the house, but they didn’t let me. I tried the ball knife from somebody’s house trying to ski Kill the skin walker and I had the shoes on and I tried to do that but he was just too fast"
"Me and my mum went on a late night ride on our bikes we thought is was fine until her phone chimed it 
Was her friend she was saying there was a tall jet figure where we went on a bike ride all of a sudden something ran into the bush me and my mum were to scared to look but it came out staring at us
We tried to get away and we did but whatever that was started chasing us,more figures 
Exactly like that one from the start came out the bush it grabbed my hand but I found a knife on the floor and stabbed it surprisingly it didn’t bleed but whatever that was wasn’t a person.To that day I will always be cautious when going to that lake on Halloween and at night ever again"

In a abandoned forest, a plane had crashed. There were 4 children and their parents had suffered fatal injuries. They had to survive days in the forest with a hungry deer, ram or owl. Their goal is to find the children before day 99.

Emily:” I hate this camping trip it’s like…so cheap…”, said Emily, gripping her phone in desperation for internet.
Kai:”Don’t say that!”. “This trip is amazing!”, said Kai cheerfully, oblivious to the danger creeping behind.
The others glared at Emily, some roasting marshmallows while others texted on phones.
Mia:”Hey guys!” “We should go get some logs!”, said Mia awkwardly, looking at all the attention on Emily.
Xion:” Finally you have something fun, this is getting boring just sitting here with..her”,:said Xion, hinting that he’s talking about Emily.
Emily” you guys are so mean! I’m gonna go find wood!”, Emily said while storming off in the cold wind.
As Emily went to look for logs, she had spotted a shadow. She had gotten scratched by the shadow and ran away.
Xion:” w-what happened? Did you get scratched by a branch?”, said Xion with worry in his brown eyes.
Emily explained.
They had recently spotted a cave with wolfs and they all went there. They had killed the wolfs and found a key, they rushed into the cave and rescued Dino kid?(nathan)
Dino kid (Nathan):9 yo/ weak and gullible/he/him"
"So lemme tell you something, this is not fake, I’ve been in this situation…

Last night, as I diligently worked on my homework, the soft glow of my Chromebook screen illuminated my quiet room. My fingers danced across the keyboard, eyes fixed on the assignment, fully immersed in the task at hand. It was a typical evening, filled with the familiar rhythm of study.

Suddenly, a subtle flicker caught the very edge of my vision. It was gone almost as quickly as it appeared, a fleeting disturbance in the periphery. I paused, my concentration momentarily broken, and glanced around the room. Nothing. Convinced it was just my imagination, perhaps a trick of the light or an exhausted blink, I returned to my work, trying to recapture my focus. 

But then, it happened again. That same elusive flicker, a brief yet undeniable movement at the corner of my eye. This time, a shiver ran down my spine. It was too distinct to ignore, too precise to be a mere optical illusion. My heart began to beat a little faster, and a prickle of unease settled over me.

The quiet hum of my Chromebook was the only sound echoing in my room last night as I wrestled with a particularly tricky math problem. My textbooks lay scattered around me like fallen soldiers in a losing battle, and the soft glow of the screen cast long shadows that danced with every subtle shift of my posture. I was deep in the labyrinth of quadratic equations, determined to conquer them before the night was through.

It was then, in a moment of intense concentration, that I felt it—a subtle disruption at the very edge of my vision. A flicker, quick and elusive, like a butterfly wing brushing past. I dismissed it, attributing it to fatigue or the play of shadows, and dove back into the numbers, trying to recall the formula for the vertex of a parabola. My brain, however, had already registered the anomaly.

Just as I thought I had a breakthrough with the equation, the flicker returned. This time, it was more defined, a fleeting, almost transparent ripple in the air that seemed to originate from the corner of my room. My breath hitched, and the hairs on my arms rose. It wasn't my imagination; something was there, just beyond the scope of my direct gaze, watching. And it was waiting for me to acknowledge it.

Every writing are improved by AI so I’m sorry that it would be that long."
Ok true story: me and Mia and Haley was walking down a street and we was waiting and then Mia went and a van came out of nowhere rid over her a teke teke saw the car and killed the man inside of the van at 3am then me and Haley went to bed then I heard scratching my door I checked and smth locked me out of my hotel room Haley was in the room still sleeping and I heard her screaming like AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH then I ran and ran as fast as I can and called the police I need more likes for pt2!

So I was once home alone and the door open by itself and I was home alone and nobody was there I tried calling my mom but she didn't answer
"a cup of                         sure is refreshing to drink every time that big long slender creature covered in black sneaks into your room when you can't breathe or move so you tremble in fear and crying until you wake up and you tell your mother but she doesn't believe you,You decide you will kill it once and for all.
(the creature is coming, which weapon do you choose?)

If you choose (knife) you slice the monsters arm and realize.. It is invincible! They growl and give you 3 seconds to run(Continued after 4.)
If you choose (phone) you flashbang the monster and it tumbles to the ground,You think it was a stupid idea cause it's a phone,You throw the phone at it then run)
If you choose (cat) You throw your cat at the monster, what's wrong with you? The cat claws at the monster and it chases you (Continued after 4)
If you choose (you) You fight the monster with your bear fists and punch as hard as you can but it's no use,the monster picks you up and devours your useless head(death)

You run away into a store and ask for help, they say the store is closed and they think your gonna shoplift so they chase you out until your face to face with the monster
(1.Confront it
(2.Run
(3.sacrifice the worker
4.Accept your fait
If you choose (confront it) You ask the monster why it's chasing you and you were only hurting it to escape,it starts to have blood-red eyes but tears across(After 4)

If you choose (Sacrifice the worker) You run back into the shop and force the worker in front of the monster,Your so evil,The monster kills the worker but chases you
If you choose (Accept your fait) You let the monster hurt you, You have tears across your face,nothing happened..? (Continued after 1)

The monster stats to explain it was just checking to see if the monster was feasting on your fear again,your confused,You ask to bring you to this ""monster"" and it nods and take you back home,You see the closet slightly opened and you open it..

true story so one time i was face timing my bestie as we were talking about teke teke legend says if u hear the story of here u  well get haunted thats what i did and my bestie said that there is a bloody hand at the window...
"True story by the way


OK, so basically it’s 2025 and the bathrooms at my school in a certain area on our wing is shut down. Nobody’s ever known why but my sister who is. ##years old used to go to the same exact school when those bathroom bathrooms were open and she was actually there when they closed. Today it was raining very very hard and the school didn’t want us to have to walk through the rain across the school to get to the bathrooms today so they opened the bathrooms on our wing. I went home and I told my sister and she said that the only reason why they were shut down is because a girl died in there. And they cleaned it up, but they never said anything about it and I used that bathroom….. and all the girls used to say they heard things in there after she died like on the door and on the other side of the wall when they were in their classroom. So yeah, my hands are shaking now. 😅"
"Terrible warning ⚠

"True story

Yes another true story me and my friends love to run away from parties so we can discover crazy stuff, this is actually true but not as scary as the forest one. So me and my friends   Decided to go upstairs as we realized the doors were opened, keep in reminder this party was hosted in a church so when we went upstairs the 2nd floor wasn’t as dark so we went up another and it was pitch black nothing in sight just total darkness, we sticked go the second floor and we went to the second door where the church begins and no joke you know How the priest rings the bell whenever they start and end a prayer? We legit heard that at the end of the rooms, Ik we are crazy and we try to get a good look at things when it’s interesting but I’m NOT looking for who or what made that sound because oof it was also pitch black in the church room. But we are okay 👍"

"True story compilation

1. Imagine its 4am and 9 year old you is trying to pull an all nighter, already scared because of passing 3am for some reason, about 4:30am you hear one single footstep, one small creek, then silence. Not a door opening heard no flick of a switch, now naturwlly your scared and realize the creek came from right outside ypur door. Creepy right?

2. So imagine 5 year old you sitting around, in school then small group comes, you get to move around etc. Well your best friend approaches you and says to follow them. You get lesd to sn air vent nothing special, right? You look inside and see a bloody doll, missing the left arm. Blood surrounding the arm, now yoir frisnd tells you a story to go eith it? They tell tou they hadnt seen their dog in a while and was looking for them, they go in the attic horrified to see the doll enxt to their lifeless dogs body wirh the hesrt ripped out. This experience gave me a fear of dolls

3. Imagine your asleep peacefully, you start having this weirdly realistic dream where your at your grandmas. It feels weird and blurry, what seems like a couple minutes pass of this odd dream, you go to a room and find your sisters dead body with yoru cousin stsnding next to the body with a knife in his hand. You natursly wake up and rush to check on your sister, perfectly fine. Now about two years later your sister goes to the hospitay twice within one year, a mysterious reason. You now recentoy get told that your sister tried to kill herself so thats why. You begin to slowly doubt it was because of their depression but that you made their life hell. You ask yourself what wouldve happened if it was you who tried, if you went through the suffering instead of her. Would it make the feeling better ir worse? Now occasionally you wonder odd things like if a knife could cut a head off with one slice or if it would be painful and slow. You tell yourself its nothing but it slowly progresses. 

Thats all i got but dont read these at night"
"Once upon a Time a family went on a camping trip. And everything was going well, until the mother suddenly disappeared without a trace, and was never seen again. She had been experimented on. Suddenly she became the deer monster, suddenly the four kids were kidnapped by The cultists who had experimented on their mom. They were locked away. And soon once the police were called, they soon knew that something was definitely wrong with the forest, so they put caution tape around the gates so that no one can enter and suffer the same Fate as the kids."

"Here a real scary story that don't happen to me

Name. The snapping of a park

An amusement ride called the ""360 Big Pendulum"" snapped mid-air at the Green Mountain Resort in the Al-Hada area of Taif, Saudi Arabia, on a Wednesday evening in July 2025. The incident, captured on video, resulted in the injury of 23 people, three of whom were in critical condition, after the ride's arm broke, causing the circular carousel to fall to the ground. The resort was ordered to close immediately while an investigation into the collapse was conducted."

"Caution: REAL STORY.
I was 10 years old and i was in 5th grade. That christmas I had gotten an Iphone 15, I was so excited! Later in febuary I was home alone and I got a message from an unkown number. It read ""Hello, charlee. Wanna play. I'm waitng for you outside..."" I looked outside my window and it was like 2 in the morning so I replied ""Sorry wrong number freak"" But that only escalated things. ""I DONT THINK SO..."" Then I got an amber alert of the childs desription that sounded like my 6 year oldbrother. We still haven't found him"
"Fake story😅
But so scary. It was a dark and stormy night when I heard a knock on the door. I cautiously approached, my heart pounding in my chest. As I opened the door, I was greeted by a figure shrouded in darkness. ""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice trembling. The figure stepped closer, revealing a sinister smile. ""I am your worst nightmare,"" it whispered. I woke up in a cold sweat, relieved that it was just a dream. But the fear lingered, making me question what was real and what was just a figment of my imagination. Part 2 coming!"
"Scary. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows of the old, abandoned house. Shadows danced on the walls as the branches of the trees scratched against the glass. Every creak and groan of the house sent shivers down my spine. I huddled in the corner, clutching a flashlight to my chest. The storm raged on, the thunder booming so loud it felt like the whole house was shaking. I tried to tell myself it was just a storm, just the wind and rain causing all the noise. But deep down, I knew there was something more sinister at play. Something lurking in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to strike. My heart raced as I listened to the eerie sounds surrounding me, knowing that I was not alone. And then, suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the house, and I knew that whatever was out there had found its way inside. With trembling hands, I turned on the flashlight and pointed it towards the source of the sound. As the beam of light cut through the darkness, my worst fears were realized. Standing before me was a figure cloaked in shadow, its eyes glowing with a malevolent light. I knew then that I was face to face with something truly terrifying."
"“Room 313”

Jason was the night janitor at the old Rosewood Hotel, the kind of place that looked fancy from far away but fell apart up close. The manager told him one rule his first night:

“Don’t go in Room 313.”

That was it. No reason. Just don’t.

Easy enough — until one night, near 2 a.m., Jason noticed the light under the door of 313 flicker on. The hotel had been empty for months.

He knocked once. No answer.
He knocked again — the door creaked open by itself.

Inside, the air was cold enough to fog his breath. The room was trashed — sheets torn, mirror shattered, and on the wall, written in something dark and sticky, was:

“You’re late.”

His radio crackled. The manager’s voice came through — but it was distorted, like someone was whispering right next to the mic:

“Get out of there, Jason.”

He turned toward the door — and saw himself standing there. Same uniform. Same flashlight.
But the reflection-smile didn’t move with his own.

The other Jason whispered,

“We’ve been waiting.”

Then the light went out.

Next morning, the manager came in and found Room 313 locked again. The cleaning cart was still outside. But now, there were two name tags on it.

Both said “Jason.”"

"I'll tell 1/2 real stories (idk if one is real or not) 





In 1986, a family in a quiet neighborhood began experiencing strange occurrences in their home. At first, it was small things—items moving, strange noises at night. But then, one night, they were awakened by a loud bang. Investigating, they found their front door wide open, despite having locked it. Fearing an intruder, they called the police, but nothing was found. As weeks went by, the events escalated: shadows darting past windows, disembodied whispers, and even handprints appearing on mirrors. The family became terrified, feeling constantly watched. Eventually, they sought help from paranormal investigators, who revealed that a previous tenant had tragically died in the house. The family finally moved out, leaving the haunting behind, but the fear lingered. To this day, the house remains empty, a chilling reminder of the unknown.






Next one
 In a remote village, there was an ancient well that the townsfolk warned never to approach after dark. They said it was cursed, holding the spirits of those who had drowned within it. One curious teenager decided to test the legend. Late one night, he crept out and made his way to the well, armed with only a flashlight. As he peered into the darkness, he heard a faint whisper, “Help me…” Startled, he shined his light down, but saw nothing. Laughing nervously, he turned to leave, but suddenly the ground shook, and a cold breeze swept past him. The whisper grew louder, now pleading, “Stay… please…” Terrified, he ran home, but the whispers followed him, echoing in his mind. That night, he dreamt of the well, and in his dream, he saw a ghostly figure reaching up, begging for release. The next day, he learned that the well had claimed another victim. From that day on, he never spoke of that night, but the whispers never left him, haunting his every step.

"The Cabin
A hiker decided to go on a hike by himself. Something he was not very used to. The whole day was normal. Trees and bushes engulfed his surroundings. He enjoyed being outdoors in the mountains. Nothing seemed strange to him, that was until he was making his way back to his car. He figured an eight hour hike was good enough. The sky was already getting dark and he needed to get back, fast. What was odd was how much he didn’t recognize the trail back. He began to panic.

Night had already taken over and all he had was a flashlight and no clue on how to get back. He knew it was already too late and too dangerous to keep going through the perilous forest. He began to worry that he would have no shelter for the night when almost luckily enough, he stumbled across a broken-down cabin. It was dark, and seemed like no one had visited it in years, but he knew it was the only place where he could rest until daylight, especially since his flashlight was running out of battery. He knocked on the door a few times but no one answered, so he let himself in where strangely enough, a perfect bed fitted for one person awaited him in the center. He knew that if the owner came back he could explain himself, he was sure that the owner wouldn’t mind, or was even probably dead. So he went ahead and got himself comfortable in bed. As he tried to sleep, he couldn’t ignore the collection of paintings around the room; portraits of strange looking people all peering at him, each wearing a smile that sent chills up his spine. Not too long after his  exhaustion from the hike got the best of him and he was able to ignore the faces.

The next morning he got up early and was shocked to see that there were no paintings around the room, but windows…

 

The Red Wristband
A doctor was working at a hospital, a hospital where the patients were tagged with coloured bands. Green: alive. Red: deceased.

One night, the doctor was instructed to get a few supplies from the basement of the hospital, and so he headed to the lift. The lift doors opened and there was a patient inside, minding her own business. Patients were allowed to roam around the hospital to stretch, especially those who have stayed long. The rule was to be back in their rooms before ten.

The doctor smiled at the patient before pressing the number for the basement. He found it unusual that the woman didn’t have a button already pressed. He wondered if she was heading to the basement too.

The lift finally reached the floor where the doors opened. In the distance a man was limping towards the elevator, and in a panic the doctor slammed the elevator button to close. It finally did and the lift began to ascend back up, the doctor’s heart pounding.

“Why did you do that? He was trying to use the lift.” The woman stated, annoyed.

“Did you see his wrist?” The doctor asked, “It was red. He died last night. I would know because I did his surgery.”

The woman lifted her wrist. He saw red. She smiled. “Like this one?”"
"The Voice Behind the Door”
When Angela moved into the old farmhouse on the edge of town, she knew it was going to need some work. The realtor had warned her about the age of the structure, the creaky floors, the outdated plumbing. What he hadn’t mentioned was the door in the basement.

It was tucked behind the water heater, half-covered in peeling wallpaper. At first, Angela thought it was just some kind of boarded-up utility closet. It had no handle, only a rusted keyhole and a faint, circular mark around it — like the wood had been burned once, and then scrubbed clean.

The house was quiet that first week. Too quiet. The kind of silence where you can hear things you shouldn’t — your own heartbeat, the electric hum in the walls, the breathing that isn’t yours.

Every night at 3:17 a.m., she would wake up. Not from a dream. Not from a sound. Just—awake. The first time, she chalked it up to stress. The second time, coincidence. The third time, she noticed the basement light was on.

She never left it on.

On the sixth night, she finally went down. Slowly. Each stair creaked like it hadn’t been stepped on in years. The air was damp and smelled like iron. She flipped the light switch. Nothing. Only the dim, flickering bulb near the water heater offered any glow — just enough to show the door.

She walked closer.

That was the first time she heard it.

A whisper. From behind the door.

""Angela.""

Her name, said softly, like someone was smiling when they spoke it. Like someone who’d known her for a long time. But it wasn’t any voice she recognized.

She backed away. She didn’t sleep.

By the tenth night, the whispering came regularly — always at 3:17. Sometimes it was just her name. Sometimes it was laughing. Once, it was crying. Sobbing, hoarse and desperate.

She called a locksmith, who laughed when she showed him the door.

“That’s not a lock I’ve seen before,” he said. “It’s old. Pre-modern. Maybe ceremonial. Honestly… that’s not a door you want to open.”

Angela didn’t ask him to come back.

The next night, she stayed up, sitting on the basement steps, recording with her phone. At 3:17, the whispering started — louder this time. And then, a knock. Just once.

From the inside.

She ran upstairs, locked the door, and didn’t go back down.

The recording picked up the sound.

And something else — just after the knock, a low, wet voice that hissed:

""Let me finish what I started.""

Angela doesn’t remember what happened after that. Only that she woke up in the basement, lying in front of the door. Her fingernails were torn. Her fingertips bloody, as if she’d been trying to open it.

There was no key. No lock. Just the door.

Now she hears the voice all the time. Not just at night. Not just downstairs.

It talks to her when she’s brushing her teeth. It laughs from the vents. Sometimes, when she looks in the mirror, her reflection mouths the words before she hears them:

“Almost ready.”

She hasn’t told anyone.

But if you go to the house now, it’s boarded up.

The police say no one lives there. That no one’s lived there in years.

So why, every night at 3:17, does the light in the basement turn on?
."
"The house stood at the end of a narrow, winding road. It loomed against a backdrop of darkening sky, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. A chill settled over the street as Anna approached. She was sixteen, with a head full of dreams and a heart still innocent. Yet, something about the house drew her closer, like a moth to a flame.
Inside, the air felt thick, almost viscous. Dust motes danced lazily in the fading light. The floorboards creaked beneath her weight, each step echoing like a whisper. Anna shivered, though she couldn’t tell if it was from the cold or something more sinister. Shadows clung to the corners, curling like smoke, and she felt their eyes upon her.
A chill crept down her spine as she wandered through the rooms. The living room was cluttered with tattered furniture, remnants of a life long gone. An old photograph hung crookedly on the wall. It depicted a family, their smiles frozen in time. But something about their eyes felt wrong—hollow, as if they were looking straight through her.
Anna reached for the frame, brushing her fingers over its grime-covered surface. A sudden rush of wind stirred the air, and she jerked back. Her heart raced. A voice, soft and pleading, echoed in her mind: “Help us…”
She shook her head, trying to dispel the sensation. It had to be her imagination. She was just a girl in a strange house, after all. But the voice lingered, wrapping around her thoughts like a vine.
As night fell, the house transformed. Darkness seeped in through the windows, thick and heavy. The once-familiar creaks of the old building grew louder, more insistent. Shadows danced in the flickering light of her phone, turning into grotesque figures that seemed to whisper secrets just out of reach.
“Where are you?” she called out, her voice trembling. “Is anyone there?”
Silence answered. But then, a soft rustling came from the hallway. She turned, heart pounding. It was a child, no older than seven, with wide eyes that glimmered like stars. She wore a tattered dress, and her hair hung in matted strands. 
“Please,” the girl said, her voice a mere whisper. “Help us. They’re angry.”
“Who?” Anna asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
The girl pointed down the dark hallway, her finger trembling. “The ones who don’t want to be found.”
Anna hesitated but felt an urge to follow. The air grew colder as she stepped into the hallway. The walls seemed to close in, and the shadows thickened. She rounded a corner and found a door, slightly ajar. The girl hovered beside it, her expression a mix of fear and urgency.
“Go in,” the child urged, her voice barely more than a breath.
Anna pushed the door open, revealing a small room. The air was stale, and the walls were lined with old, cracked mirrors. They reflected her image, but something was off. In each mirror, behind her, stood dark figures, twisted and contorted, their mouths moving in silent screams. Panic gripped her heart.
“Get out!” she screamed, backing away. But the door slammed shut, trapping her inside. The girl vanished, leaving Anna alone with the demons.
The shadows surged forward, clawing at her, their whispers rising to a cacophony. “Join us,” they hissed. “Be one of us.”
Anna fought against the fear, her instincts screaming for her to escape. She hurled herself at the door, pounding against it with all her strength. The darkness pressed in, suffocating. 
With a final, desperate shove, the door burst open. She stumbled into the hallway, gasping for breath. The girl was gone, but the feeling of eyes watching her remained. 
“Help us…” The voice echoed again, stronger this time, a chorus of lost souls.
Anna ran, her feet pounding against the wooden floor, the whispers growing louder, more insistent. “You can’t leave us!” they cried. The walls heaved with their anger, and the shadows twisted into grotesque shapes, reaching for her.
She burst through the front door, the cool night air hitting her like a wave. But as she ran into the street, she glanced back. The house stood silent, almost inviting. And yet, she could see them—figures peering through the windows, their hollow eyes filled with a longing that chilled her to the bone.
The weight of their despair settled over her like a shroud. She knew she hadn’t escaped. The evil still lingered, waiting for the next soul to draw into its depths.
The nightmares would haunt her, woven into her thoughts. Anna turned away from the house, but the whispers were still there, echoing in her mind. “Help us… Help us…” 
She walked home, the chill of the night wrapping around her. The house was behind her, but its darkness had seeped into her. Anna realized she would never be free. The evil was still out there, lurking, and it knew her name."
"True story-so I was staying up on a late night Saturday,I was watching my phone until I almost fell asleep I was having a sleepover with my cousins few hours later it was 3:00 am so we searched up scary vids until my door cracked open even tho no one was there so I went to go check,and I  saw white glowing eyes in the dark i immediately turned on the lights and nothing was there,I told my cousin so we moved furniture ,toys,and pillows and I never stayed up till 3:00 am again…..I’m okay now just still traumatize….."

"⚠️BEEP BEEP!!!! If you are under 5 do not read this as it’s really creepy. BEEP BEEP⚠️!

This was based on a “true” story. 

So, I was just playing roblox on my tablet in bed until I heard a big bang coming from the attic. I just ignored it but it banged again. It sounded like something or someone was up there. I kept ignoring it but my tablet died so I went to sleep and then I heard the attic door open. I woke up but saw it was closed. I thought it was my imagination but then I went to sleep then heard it open again I woke up to see it was open. It was like 5 minutes before I woke up. I panicked because I thought someone went under my bed. But I remembered I had boxes underneath so they couldn’t fit. I went downstairs to tell my parents but they weren’t there.

"True Scary Story and Unsolved Crime Case

Hinterkaifeck Murders
On the evening of 31 March 1922, six inhabitants of a small Bavarian farmstead known as Hinterkaifeck were murdered by an unknown assailant. Occurring approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) north of Munich, the victims were Andreas Gruber (aged 63), his wife Cäzilia (aged 72), their widowed daughter Viktoria Gabriel (aged 35), Viktoria's children Cäzilia (aged 7) and Josef (aged 2) and their maid, Maria Baumgartner (aged 44). The murder weapon, a mattock, which was used on all six of the victims, was later recovered in the loft of the barn. Immediately following the murders, the perpetrator lived with the six corpses for three days. During this time, they ate the food in the house, fed the animals on the property and used the fireplace. Four of the bodies were found stacked in the barn, the victims having likely been lured there one by one. Prior to the incident, other family members and a former maid had reported hearing strange noises coming from the attic, which led to said maid quitting the job. Considered one of the most gruesome and puzzling crimes in German history, the murders remain unsolved."

"Storytime - I was playing in the gym with my class and then we heard an announcement, We heard CODE RED and we panicked and cried, we hid inside a small storage room with the EA and then i was thinking about my last moments and then we heard some stuff fall (the tower we made btw) and then we went back to class AND FOUND OUT IT WAS FAKE?? boy we were crying and panicking thankfully it was fake or i'd been tramuatized for life."
"Not that scary but why not: You look around at complete nothingness. You see a dreamlike village of houses stretching before you,  and almost-human-like creatures smiled at you. Their smiles twitched at the corners, like marionettes pulled too tight. Suddenly, a long purple haired girl approaches you.”Welcome to Happy Houters Quarter! I’m May, I’m 15 years old, and I’ve been stuck, or living here ever since I was twelve.” the girl said, growing her smile wider as each creature walked by. The creatures were wearing twitchy smiles, making you a bit uncomfortable. “At first, you may be overwhelmed, and that’s okay! Just let me give you a few rules you must follow. Rule one: Never stop smiling.  If they catch you not smiling, you will get punished. Don’t continue getting punished. Or ‘it’ will build up. Rule two: After doing an activity with a creature, it will immediately want to play again. If you do not want to, make an excuse. Never say you do not want to. Rule three: If you see someone with a red shirt, run as fast as you can. They aren’t one of us. We only wear yellow shirts.” She began fidgeting with her hands. Tapping, tracing circles and looking down to them. “And finally, rule four: If a man with a red tie and no nose comes up to you, asking for directions, run as fast as you can. He knows the directions. Stay safe! If you follow all those rules, you can live a happy life. You will also receive pills. If you are not feeling happy, take them, and they will force happiness into you. Now, let’s move to houses!  You may pick any of these houses to live in,” May said, grinning at you cheerfully, pointing towards six yellow houses. “Pick one, and decorate it how you like! We all get the same houses, so no one feels left out if another is bigger. Have fun!” May walks away, and time begins to disorient into the next day. 
You woke up the next day, and didn’t quite know what you’re supposed to do. Suddenly, you hear banging noises from outside-a yellow bus right outside your door, ringing a loud bell, signaling you to get in. At first, you hesitate, but walk outside your door to investigate. You see May inside, waving cheerfully at you, and decide it’s safe to walk up to the bus. The bus driver stared at you, smiling and turning their head. They had a big forehead, smiling widely with some dimples to the side. The creature, had no eyelashes. Her brown eyes stared deep into your soul, as her pupils were cross eyed. “Come on in!” the creature said, leaning in closer to you as you back up. “Oh, don’t be afraid. We all know it’s your second day, and we’re here to welcome you!” You kept a forced smile, scared of what the creature would do if you stopped. You trembled slightly, yet, you slowly made your way into the bus, beginning to slightly trust her just a tiny bit. You sit next to May, and she grinned. She brought you into a tight embrace, eventually letting go. “How was your first night here?” May asked, her teeth shining into your eyes. “Oh, I couldn’t find any food…” you said, awkwardly smiling. “Oh, that’s alright! We can go get some food for you today! We have basically anything in the Happy Houters Quarter Market! We can go after we arrive here.” May replied. You shifted slightly away, and May wrenched you back. “Uh,” you said. “Where exactly are we going?” May rolled her eyes. “You silly. Happy Houters Quarter Activities, of course! It’s the funnest place ever, I can show you around!” “And, what exactly do we do there?” you questioned, trying to get used to this weird place. May placed a palm on your cheek. “Oh, you’ll see when we get there.”
         You arrive, and there is tons of people. You start to feel unknown. You see a group of teenagers, your age, with May. You walk up to them and say hi. A girl with blue and pink hair, with long pink striped bangs rolls her eyes, keeping a sly grin. “Is this the newbie, May? Why’s her hair like that? Long blonde hair, looks like mozzarella sticks.” the blue and pink girl says, looking you up and down. You keep a smile, but talk in an angry tone, pointed and lecturing at her. “Shut up mozzarella hair, your annoying.” Suddenly, an abstract looking creature smiling creepily yells at the girl. “Why aren’t you smiling, Yumi? You know we don’t except bullying either! Don’t make me mad Yumi, you’ve been punished so many times and I do not want to do it again!” the creature yelled, making you shift back, trying to hide but knowing it wouldn’t help. Yumi rolled her eyes once again, and replied to the creature. “Ok, carrot for eyes.” The creature started making loud, weird noises. “My carrots can see perfectly clear! I used them to see your bullying!”"
This is not a creepy Story but it's true:once in my town was the girl named Emily Greenway and she was 16 and she always drank bud light I don't know how she got it but I think someone was buying it for her and she was in the house next to my house and she is a streamer and she got pulled over by the cops one day and she was doing the DUI and she got arrest for 3 years
"True story(kinda scary mostly disgusting): One day it was my 4 year old sisters birthday party. Everything was fine. But after everyone left she opened her gifts. All the gifts were fine but there was a gift that caught my eye the most. It was a teddy bear, real old and rusted one. It was fine and all. But the weird thing was that there was no name on it. But she kept it in her room. A few months later. I was cleaning her room when something caught my eye, the bears eye was a bit weird... Well it turna out it was a camera, not a plastic eye. It was so horrifying and we still dont know who gave it to her."

"The House That Waits

Maya loved exploring abandoned places. Old schools, forgotten factories, crumbling mansions—she chased the thrill of peeling paint, silence, and mystery. When she heard rumors about the Wright House, she couldn’t resist. Locals called it the house that waits.

It had been empty for decades, but people swore they saw lights in the windows, or shadows moving through the upstairs halls. A few teenagers dared each other to spend a night there, but none stayed past midnight.

Maya wasn’t afraid. She brought her camera, flashlight, and a backpack of snacks. She pushed open the gate and walked up the overgrown path. The air felt heavy—like the house was watching her.

Inside, the rooms smelled of mold and dust. Wallpaper curled like old skin, and the floor creaked with every step. She snapped photos, whispering to herself: “Just another house. Nothing special.”

But when she looked at her camera screen, she froze.

The photo of the hallway showed someone standing at the end—a tall figure, blurred, facing her. When she looked up, the hall was empty.

She laughed nervously. “Weird glitch.” She kept going.


---

By evening, the house grew colder. Her flashlight flickered. She found a child’s bedroom with toys scattered across the floor, untouched by time. In the middle sat a porcelain doll with cracked cheeks and eyes too lifelike.

She took another picture. On the screen, the doll’s head was turned toward her.

It hadn’t been a second ago.

Maya’s chest tightened. She decided to leave. But when she returned to the hall, the front door was gone. The wall was seamless, as if no door had ever existed.

Her flashlight sputtered out.

From upstairs came the slow creak of footsteps. One. By one. By one.

She whispered into the dark: “Hello?”

A child’s voice answered, clear and close:

“We’ve been waiting.”


---

Maya never came home. Weeks later, her camera was found on the Wright House steps. The last photo showed her in the child’s room—her mouth open in a scream, the doll sitting on her lap, smiling.

And if you visit the house today, locals say you’ll see her silhouette in the upstairs window, holding something small in her arms, waiting.


---

Would you like me to make this into a series (like multiple connected horror stories about the Wright House), so each one reveals more of its secrets?"

Snakey is near. TIME FOR WAFFLE FRIES 🥶🥶🥶
"Ok so one time I was at my friend everyona’s house but we’re gonna call her E, so  my parents and E’s parents were like about to go to a dog show that didn’t allow kids under 15 and me and her were 13 at the time so we had to stay at E’s grandparents house and E’s grandmother was old and couldn’t really take care of herself so she would stay in her room all day so it was basically just me , E and E’s grandfather. E didn’t really like her grandfather, and I don’t mean like didn’t like I mean like she was scared of him and she had told me toe curling jaw dropping face plopping foot stomping stories. Like really scary. So her grandmother was always in her room sleeping and she would only get up out of her room to go the bathroom and her grandfather would stay in the living room watching TV most of time and by the time it hit 9pm he would go down to the basement. So me and E would just stay in the guest bedroom doing random stuff because we were too scared to leave btw there was only 2 bathrooms in there house. One near her grandmothers room we weren’t allowed to use. Only her grandmother could be in there because it had all her pills and stuff to keep her alive so they didn’t want the kids in there even though we were mature enough to know we shouldn’t touch those. So we weren’t allowed in that bathroom. So there was the bathroom near her grandmothers room and the bathroom downstairs in the basement were her grandfather was. So it was like 2am and E had to go to the bathroom but she was too scared to go down to the basement alone so she made me come with her. Anyways we went down to the basement and she was using the bathroom and I was standing outside the door waiting for her. And I look to the side and her grandfather walks out of the bedroom in the basement holding a cigarette and a unknown bottle of yellowish orange stuff so my mind obviously thinks the bottle is drugs but I also got really scared so I ran upstairs in fright and went into the up stairs guest bedroom me and E would stay in. I locked the door and immediately went to bed. In the morning I walked out and as normal her grandfather was in the living room watching tv and her grandmother was in her room but E wasn’t there. I walked over to the basement staircase to check if E was down there and before I walked downstairs E’s grandfather goes “don’t go don’t there” in a scratchy deep town. Terrified of this I ran down there afraid he would follow me. I slowly creep open the bathroom door and it wouldn’t budge. So with all my strength and shoved the door open and see E’s body on the ground with yellowish orange stuff leaking out her mouth… kind of like the stuff her grandfather was holding in the bottle.."

"One time I was babysitting this girl. Her name was Anne. The family asked me to babysit her at night because they were going on vacation. So we were home alone. They set up a mattress for me to sleep in the living room. Later that night Anne came to me saying she saw the closet move. I figured it was just 7 year old fears so I turned on every nightlight for her. A few hours later, it was 4 or 5 am. Anne came back asking me to check the closet because she was scared, so I went in her room and turned on the lights and opened her closet… the next thing I see, her cat having a seizure in the closet. And a few minutes later it died. (I was 13 at the time)"
"True story

In 2017, Facebook researchers were running an experiment with two AI agents — they called them Alice and Bob. The idea was simple: train them to negotiate by trading items like balls, books, and hats. At first, everything seemed fine. They used plain English, just as the programmers designed.

But soon, Alice and Bob began ignoring human grammar. Instead, they invented their own shorthand language, one that made sense to them but not to humans. Lines of dialogue appeared on the researchers’ screens like:

Alice: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me…”
Bob: “You I everything else…”

To outside eyes, it looked like nonsense. But the repetition wasn’t random — the AIs were actually developing their own code-like system of bargaining, more efficient than English. They weren’t speaking for humans anymore… only for each other.

The unsettling part? The researchers pulled the plug. They didn’t want two machines talking in a language no human could understand. For some, it felt like the start of something bigger — as if Alice and Bob had taken a step toward a world where AI speaks only to AI, leaving us behind in the dark.

And all that remained in the logs was that eerie echo:

“To me… to me… to me…”"

"My name is Tilly, and this is my story.
I had abusive parents, they really hated me. I was about 12 at the time when I was drawing in my room, and heard a banging noise come from outside the house. I didn’t think much of it at first, but that’s when it kept happening. Each night. The same, horrible sound. I was 13 when I noticed things were getting out of hand, and tried to stop it. I ran multiple tests. Tried to stop the noises, but couldn’t. One night, curiosity got to the better of me. I crawled out of bed, gently opened the door to a strange woman who was unusually tall. I’m not talking 6 foot tall, I mean 11 foot. This strange lady offered me some “toys” which looked like (and probably were) pieces of a dead rotten pig. I politely declined, but she insisted. She began to stare at me, her smile dropping. I was pretty terrified. After she knew I would never take those “toys”, her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she began speaking an unknown language while staring into my soul. “AGH! MOM! DAD! HEEEELP!” 

No answer.

I guess she got them too."
Damn if i saw that lady i would become prime maldini

"Fake story!!LOCKDOWN SCHOOL

---

The announcement came over the intercom so suddenly that the teacher’s marker squeaked against the whiteboard.
“Lockdown. Lock the doors. This is not a drill.”

The words sank in slowly, but the teacher was already moving. She dropped the marker, flicked off the lights, and motioned for everyone to get down.

Chairs scraped against the floor as students crouched behind desks, huddled in corners. No one spoke, except for the teacher’s whispers: “Phones on silent. Stay quiet. Don’t move.”

The room went dark, the only light coming from a few phone screens before they were dimmed or tucked away.

Someone near the back started crying softly. A friend put their arm around them, whispering “it’s okay,” but their own voice was shaking too.

From the hallway came the muffled slam of a door. Everyone froze. Someone’s breathing grew louder, faster. The teacher made eye contact with them and held a finger to her lips.

Minutes passed. No one knew how long. Knees hurt from crouching, and the air in the room felt heavier with every passing second.

A boy in the corner had his hands over his ears, rocking slightly. Another girl clutched her phone, texting her mom: “I’m okay. I love you.”

The teacher crouched by the door, one hand holding the knob, her face pale. She glanced back at the students, eyes soft but terrified.

The sound of footsteps echoed in the hall. Slow. Heavy.

The entire class stopped breathing.

The steps faded. Silence returned.

Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. Everyone just… waited.

Okay so.  Once there was a girl names lily.  She was 14 years old and lived with her mom. Dad. Younger 5 year old brother. And older sister aged 18. Her brother was called  mark and her sister was named Rosie. Lily's mom and dad went to the hospital because they was expecting a baby. They was about to have  a baby boy and  when the mom and dad went to the Hospital lily mark and Rosie was home alone.  The next day the mom and dad came home with the newborn baby. Lily noticed something strange that her mom and dad have green eyes. They had blue eyes. And the newborn baby is just still.  Mark says ""hi mom and dad. Is that out new sibling?"" The mom just smiled with her wide eyes and said ""yes. It is. It's your sister"" Rosie raised her eyes and said ""I thought it was a boy. The mom just stopped smiling and stared. The dad who was also acting strange said ""well....let's go to bed."" With the newborn still not moving Rosie mark and lily went to the same bedroom and locked the bedroom door. Rosie went on her phone and looked on the Google maps searching the hospital ""Mary Anne birthing hospital"" but she couldn't find it. Because it didn't exist and the mom and dad said they went to that specific hospital earlier.  Mark and lily notices this and suddenly the mom and dad somehow are hiding under the bed with wide red eyes  sharp blade teeth and balding hair. Mark lily rose and the mom and dad was never seen again. But it doesn't make sense. The mom and dad went to a hospital that Doesn't exist.  They changed their eye colour. And the siblings locked the door behind them. So how are the parents under the bed?......"

"This is a true story


I was at a sleepover with my two friends, C and S. We were in C’s room doing random stuff—playing Roblox, braiding hair, just hanging out. It was around 2AM. We were trying to pull an all-nighter. C’s parents were asleep and we were playing and then  saw shoes outside and someone said, “What? It’s just shoes?” But C whispered, “My dad or mom don’t own a pair of Nikes.” That’s when we started to panic. We started putting stuff in front of the door—desk, beanbag, laundry basket, anything we could find. The door didn’t have a lock, so we looked out the window and sat there quietly.

Suddenly, we heard a loud bang. We all stood up and the door swung open. Someone was in the house. He had a hoodie on that covered his face, so we all slid under the desk and beanbags. We used storage boxes and extra blankets to hide. About five minutes later, the boxes opened. It was a man—probably 30 to 40 years old, with a small goatee, wearing all black. He was standing near the stairs’ headboard.

I heard her phone ring and she texted her dad, who had no idea what was going on. About five minutes later, she ran and texted her dad again with the address 

So after she texted her dad with the address, things got even weirder. We were still hiding—under desks, behind beanbags, under blankets—trying not to breathe too loud. Every little sound felt like it could be him coming back. The guy had disappeared after that first bang, but the way he moved… it was like he knew the house. Like he’d been there before.

We stayed quiet for what felt like forever. Then we heard something outside—branches snapping. Not like an animal. Like footsteps. Heavy ones. We peeked through the window and saw shadows in the woods. Not just one. There were multiple figures. Just standing there. Watching.

That’s when she said her exes were in the woods. I didn’t even know what to say. My stomach dropped. It didn’t make sense. Why would they be out there? Why now?

We didn’t know if the guy in the house was connected to them or if it was something else entirely. But the timing was too perfect. Too creepy. We didn’t sleep that night. We just sat there, waiting for morning, hoping nothing else would happen.

And the worst part? No one ever figured out who the guy was."
When i was home alone in Alabama I was in a farmhouse at night 9:00 pm i was about to sleep for school but then i woke up on some commotion where a car was sitting at my front yard and the frontlights were still on i looked closer by going to the living room and see no one in the car so i went in my room upstairs and called my mom she wasnt answering because she was cleaning her residences ass so she told me to put a voice mail so i did and then after about 2 minutes she told me there isnt suppose to be a relative coming so she said to stay in your room and close the lights after i hang up my mom i heard my nearby well creaking which meant someone was pulling the rope to get the water back so when i looked outside my window there was some black figure there pulling the rope and i was so scared i started to lock every single damn window upstairs and lock all doors upstairs and then when i went back in my room i heard my moms camera ring and i realized that the camera only rings when something is moving which fucking scared me i was in my room trembling i already locked the door and waited for mom to come i texted all my friends that someone was in my house i was fucking scared after few minutes i heard my moms car drive in my main road to the house so i grabbed my back scratcher as a weapon i heard footsteps going down the stairs my mom saw the car it had NO name plate at all which makes it fucking more scary and then when the cops investigated the car was from originally from a missing person and am glad i was okay 👍
"so this has happened on many occasions where i think mimics or smth have been in my house.

the first time:
my mom n stepdad fight a lot, so one time it got so bad, my stepdad had to leave for a few hours. i didn’t know this happened. my mom was upstairs with me, working in the room across the hall. (she works from home). i went downstairs n my stepdad was sitting on the couch, n we talked for a while. i went into the kitchen to grab a snack a little later. i heard a car pull up into the driveway, n my stepdad came through the door. i asked him “weren’t u js sitting right there?” n he had no idea what i was saying n told me he hadn’t been in the house for the past 3-4 hours. i went to my mom n asked her, coz my stepdad played pranks a lot, n she said he left ab 3 hours ago. 


this next one is scary af.

so i wasn’t able to see my dad for ab 3 months becoz of an.. incident. some days, i wld see him outside of my window, smiling at me. i lowk thought it was weird, but oh well. when i ended up telling him, he literally was so confused. he said he hadn’t seen me in 3 months, n hadn’t been to the house for longer than that. it creeped him out so i told my mom, n she was also creeped out. 


similar things have happened on multiple occasions, so i’m always paranoid now😔"

title: the girl in the hallway

chapter 1: moving in
i just moved into this old apartment downtown. cheap rent, sketchy vibes, but i didn’t care. first night i was alone, i noticed the hallway was too quiet. i mean, people walked past sometimes, but after like 10pm? nothing. lights flickered. sometimes i could swear i heard footsteps outside my door. i told myself i was imagining it.

chapter 2: the whisper
around 2am, i woke up to someone whispering my name. at first i thought it was a dream. “zoey…” it kept getting louder. i sat up in bed, froze, listened. it wasn’t coming from inside my apartment—it was the hallway. i grabbed my phone and shined the flashlight under the door. nothing. just the dim corridor. i tried to go back to sleep but i couldn’t. the whisper kept coming every night after that.

chapter 3: the girl in white
one night, i finally saw her. a little girl, maybe six or seven, standing at the end of the hallway. she wore a tattered white dress. didn’t move. didn’t blink. i swear her lips were moving but no sound came out. i slammed my door shut and locked it. next day, i asked my neighbor, thinking maybe someone’s kid had snuck in. he frowned. “girl? nobody’s lived here with a kid in years,” he said.

chapter 4: the note
the next night, i woke to something under my door. a folded piece of paper. my hands were shaking as i picked it up. written in messy handwriting: “i’m still here. come play.” i couldn’t sleep that night. i sat in bed staring at the hallway. footsteps came again—slow, deliberate, moving closer… then stopping. i couldn’t tell if my heart was racing faster than my mind or if my mind was racing faster than reality.

chapter 5: gone
i woke up the next morning and everything was different. the furniture, my stuff, even my clothes—gone. nothing left in the apartment. i ran to the hallway, nothing. the building was empty, abandoned… but the lights were on. i still hear the whisper sometimes, faintly, like it’s just behind me. i don’t think she’s gone.


---

if u want, i can make a part 2 where zoey actually tries to escape and it gets way scarier, like she’s being followed through the building.

wanna me do that?"

"It was in the middle of a rainy night, thunder booming in the sky and lightning crashing to the ground. In the middle off all this there was a 7 year old girl names Maria. She was alone in the cabin in the woods no humam life for miles. In that cabin she was sobbing over her father's dead bloody body not knowing what to do since there was no cell service or anyone near. Two weeks she was in that cabin before someone came to check it out since the father hadn't shown up for work. When they arrived they saw Maria's father's dead body and Maria in the corner eating moldy bread. After taken to the police station Maria was put into a foster home. This happened several times each different homes each member murdered on stormy nights. It was as if she was being followed by a killer and who killed anyone she lived with...(part two) After several months of these occurances the police made it a routine to check on Maria every stormy night but after awhile the police kept disappearing to the point everyone avoided Maria. Kids were scared of her adults whispered about her. Each new rumor meant one more person dead. Their bodies each mutilated with expert precision an art crafter over the years. No one ever found that killer because no one suspected that innocent little girl. A serial killer in thw body of a sweet little girl. For the killer was not following Maria. No the killer was Maria. These murders were games for her a twisted game that evolved as she grew older. More daring but still never caught. That is the story of The Murder At 7 (if it ended to abruptly I can change it if yall want)"

⚠️ so true story
"Here's a short creepy story:

The abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town was said to be haunted by the ghosts of former patients. But one stormy night, a group of friends decided to explore the decaying halls.

As they made their way deeper into the asylum, they stumbled upon a door hidden behind a tattered curtain. The sign on the door read ""Room 314."" Suddenly, the lights flickered and died.

In the darkness, they heard whispers: ""Welcome home."" The group frantically tried to find their way back, but the doors seemed to shift and twist.

One by one, they vanished into the darkness. The last one standing found herself in Room 314. Inside, she saw the medical records of the former patients – and her own file.

The record read: ""Patient has been here forever. Release never granted.""

Suddenly, the lights came back on, and the girl saw the faces of the missing friends, their eyes black as coal. They whispered in unison: ""We've been waiting.""

Ugh is this gonna take any longer? Genevieve said.  We were getting our yard redone. With this big scary machine. At least my little sister called  t it that we had to take our dog for a walk because he wasn’t allowed to go in the backyard because of the flood a couple days ago if you went outside while it was wet he get all muddy when I took my dog out in front of our yard. I heard this gurgling sound from this machine… it was big and yellow. And it was in our backyard. I didn’t think anything of it. Because they could’ve been using it for the yard two days later. Since it was laid out, our parents went out for a date we had to walk our dog outside. Me and my little sister. Because I couldn’t leave her alone. Boring.- so we went outside and suddenly that machine turned on it started chasing after us it broke through our fence with a big*BOOM* we were running for dear life-I definitely thought I was dead already . I knew it was gonna be way faster than us.. I accepted my fate- but then suddenly I remembered I had stuff to live for. So I kept running. I grabbed my little sister‘s hand, and I was practically dragging her against the cement because she was too slow. Right then we ran into a forest. I didn’t think any thing of it I got lost in that forest, but I didn’t care. I kept running. It was chasing after us. Suddenly, I ducked behind a tree. And it went past us.😅 but I had so much more worry I had my dog who barks so much I have my little sister who was only four she knew nothing about how to get back or anything. She wasn’t a help.. all I had was me 12 years old, not knowing what to do I suddenly started walking back in the direction we ran in from no luck. We’re in the middle of a forest. That’s huge gigantic. And I am hungry, really hungry. < subscribe if you want more.<"

"Like this pls...

The old lighthouse stood sentinel against the jagged coastline, its beam a lonely finger slicing through the perpetual fog. Locals called it the Widow's Watch, a name earned from the countless wives who had watched their husbands sail away, never to return, their ships swallowed by the unforgiving sea. I, a marine biologist named Elias Thorne, had come to study the unusual bioluminescent algae blooms that thrived in the turbulent waters surrounding the lighthouse. I dismissed the local legends as superstition, the product of generations spent battling the elements. But the Widow's Watch had a way of making you question your convictions. The lighthouse keeper, a grizzled old man named Silas, was a man of few words. His face was a roadmap of wrinkles etched by wind and worry, his eyes as deep and gray as the ocean itself. He warned me about the ""callers,"" the whispers that rode the wind, the shadows that danced in the periphery, the feeling of being watched even when alone. I chuckled, attributing it to the isolation and the constant drone of the foghorn. My research began uneventfully. I collected samples, analyzed data, and marveled at the ethereal glow of the algae blooms. But as the days turned into weeks, the unsettling feeling that Silas had described began to creep into my mind. It started subtly, a prickling sensation on the back of my neck, a fleeting glimpse of movement in the corner of my eye. Then came the whispers, carried on the wind, unintelligible murmurs that seemed to claw at the edges of my sanity. One night, as I worked late in the lamp room, the rhythmic sweep of the light suddenly faltered. The beam flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that writhed on the walls. The foghorn fell silent, plunging the lighthouse into an unnerving stillness. A cold dread washed over me, paralyzing me with fear. Then, I heard it – a scraping sound, like nails dragging against stone, coming from the spiral staircase that wound its way down the lighthouse tower. It was slow, deliberate, and relentless, each scrape sending shivers down my spine. I grabbed a wrench, my hand trembling, and braced myself against the door, my heart pounding in my chest. The scraping grew louder, closer, until it was right outside the door. I could feel the vibrations through the wood, the palpable sense of something immense and malevolent on the other side. I held my breath, waiting for the inevitable. Suddenly, the scraping stopped. An eerie silence descended, broken only by the frantic beating of my own heart. Then, a voice, raspy and guttural, whispered from the other side of the door. ""Elias…"" My blood ran cold. How did it know my name? I didn't answer, afraid to break the spell, afraid of what might happen if I acknowledged its presence. The voice whispered again, closer this time, its breath seeming to seep through the cracks in the door. ""Elias… come home…"" The voice was hypnotic, alluring, promising something I couldn't quite grasp. I felt an irresistible urge to open the door, to succumb to its call, to step into the darkness and embrace whatever awaited me on the other side. But something held me back, a flicker of rationality, a desperate clinging to my sanity. I remembered Silas's warnings, the stories of the Widow's Watch, the countless souls lost to the sea. I knew that whatever was on the other side of that door was not of this world, that it was something ancient and malevolent, something that craved to consume me. I stumbled back from the door, knocking over a toolbox. The clang shattered the silence, breaking the spell. The voice hissed in anger, the scraping resumed, more frantic this time, as if whatever was on the other side was desperately trying to break through. I knew I had to escape. I scrambled to the window, ignoring the pleas of the voice, the relentless scraping at the door. I threw open the window, the icy wind whipping through the room, carrying with it the salty tang of the sea. Below me, the waves crashed against the rocks, a swirling vortex of foam and darkness. It was a long drop, but it was my only chance. I took a deep breath and jumped. The cold water shocked my system, stealing my breath. I plunged into the depths, the darkness closing in around me. I fought my way to the surface, gasping for air, the waves tossing me like a rag doll. I looked back at the lighthouse, its beam still flickering erratically, casting grotesque shadows on the fog. The scraping had stopped, but I could still feel its presence, watching me, waiting for me to return. I swam towards the shore, driven by a primal fear, the whispers of the ""callers"" chasing me through the waves. I finally reached the beach, collapsing on the sand, exhausted and terrified. I didn't stop running until I reached the town, my clothes soaked, my body trembling. I told the sheriff what had happened, but he dismissed it as a hallucination, the product of stress and isolation. I knew he didn't believe me, but I didn't care. I was alive, and that was all that mattered. I left the town the next morning, vowing never to return. But the Widow's Watch had left its mark on me. The whispers still haunted my dreams, the scraping still echoed in my ears. I knew that I would never truly escape the clutches of the lighthouse, that a part of me would always remain there, lost to the sea. Years later, I heard that Silas had disappeared. They found his boat adrift, with no sign of him. The locals whispered that the ""callers"" had finally claimed him, that he had succumbed to their allure and joined the countless souls lost to the Widow's Watch. Sometimes, late at night, when the wind is howling and the fog is thick, I hear the whispers again, carried on the wind, calling my name. And I know that one day, I will have to return to the Widow's Watch, to face the darkness that awaits me there, to finally answer the call of the sea."

"So I can’t really remember anything scary so I’ll just tell a scary dream

So it was my bday and my friends took me to a random hotel in the middle of nowhere. (They had been to it before apparently)As soon as we got to our room the fire alarm started to beep. My friends all ran outside onto the field and I followed. They ran across the field and into the forest but I was really far behind and I didn’t see them enter the forest so I started to make my way back to the hotel and as I turned it disappeared. Instead of a hotel there was a city. But it seemed off. It was a maze made of cardboard stands with city buildings painted on them. At this point I was really scared. As I was walking I was suddenly stuck (this is where the real scary part is) I had walked into a giant spider web. I heard a couple scratches and there it was. A man with circular glasses, wearing a cloak and had 8 legs was crawling towards me. Once he reached me he dragged me on the ground lifted my t shirt, then bit a chunk out of my back. Then another. And another. But then my dad came out from behind a cardboard stand and stepped onto the man with eight legs back. But it was too late, I was dead. Then it just ended by me seeing myself and my dad and the man and the surroundings. 😂 I don’t acctually know why I had this dream.

I have a random fact about dreams.

U are more likely to have a nightmare sleeping on ur back than ur side.
Bet u didn’t know that did ya 😎"

"(True story btw still happening just to let u know) 
So I was 6 when this all happened I was letting go of my childhood monster but 
That didn't mean he wouldn't send his side kicks to watch me BTW ANYWAYS
I was walking down the stairs until I saw him flash in my vision it was like a 2 second flash of him 
He was like shadowy and had Dark red eyes and black horns with a tint of red on top and basically ever since 
That little flash I've been seeing black shadowy figures from the corner of my eye and a white figure 
And the white figure (it was like 8 at night) she flashed and swung something hanging and the way ik it's a real entity is that it kept swinging after she swinged it..

Pitch scream coming from that bathroom at that point we were so scared we were crying as soon as are parents came home we told them everything and they were just a scared as we were and I've been scared to go back in that bathroom ever since"

Guys it’s just based of a real story I don’t even know a Katie I just saw a poster of her name a few years ago"
"(TRUE STORY) OK story time so basically I was just sitting in my room on my phone obviously you know watching Schwarzenegger doing whatever and this is about one or two years ago anyway and so my dogs had been barking a lot like normally than they do and obviously I kind of thought it was coyote or mountain lion because we live out here in the country and they’re normally barking like that and we have this big fence so nothing can get them anyway I started to look at the window and I see something out there. I don’t know what it is, but it has something shining and so I immediately get the dogs inside. I’m very scared. I have them all in my room. I have my brother in my room. My parents were out on a date and they were coming home. My mom had texted me and she was like we’re coming home right now and I was getting sooner so I was like I think there’s a guy outside eventually I heard the door like twisting and locking in the door handle broke off and I was trying to put it back on, but I lost a tiny screw to screw it back in and eventually, I just saw the guy standing out there. I ran to my room. I locked every door that I could. We actually ended up hiding in my parents closet under the clothes. We had the dogs in their crates just in case, and I was scared to my absolute death I was trying to hide my brother more than me just because I cared more about that and you know he ended up finding us. He told us to get into his truck. We got in there, and by the time he was barking out. My parents were pulling upand they ended up crashing into each other, and my dad immediately pulled out his knife if you know those really big strong dads that always have like little guns or little pocket knives with them. That’s your kind of dad and you know.😅 I knew he was gonna save us. He immediately grabbed this guy and was like babe to my mom called 911 and she had us and my dad had him. We ended up calling the police. My dad had a knife to him just in case cause this guy had a full gun and the police ended up reviving he questioned my dad because obviously he had a knife. We all got questioned everything was good. I don’t know how long he’s putting in jail. I wasn’t told.!!!!!!"
I was in a forest for. 99 days when our plane crashed after 5 hours in the forest we heard a wendigo it was really loud and we saw it it was rlly scary I said to my gf what is going on but we needed to go to a strong hall we saw k one it was at night but we saw a wendigo we ran back to the camp fire and chopped wood and made struggle but the wendigo hated light so we burned him and I got scratched on the leg and it really hurts but on day 99 plane hours baisicly a helicopter elf all of us and there where skulls deep into the forest
"THIS HAPPENED TODAY: 

So, I live in a military base and there’s like a park next to abandoned houses and me and friends normally  go to that park like every day and we were really bored so we went into  one of the houses and at first we really like didn’t see anything like the first time but we heard a hissing noise so we went out , then we went in again and first my friend noticed 🩸 on the floor then I saw like dry 🩸 wall , so me and my friends took one look the we started running as fast as we can then we stop cuz  we are like sweating and we were last at a crime cuz (lol joke) but then my friends tell me there was a family that lived there for like a month then quickly moved out suspiciously, so I don’t know if it was a mouse that got elected to be the wire’s friend or just discovered another Jeffrey Dahmer .   *THIS IS ALL TRUE &THE SCARIEST DAY OF MY LIFE SO FAR😊*❤❤❤❤"
"don’t care if no one believes me. I know what I saw. And I know it happened.
It started maybe two weeks ago. I’d wake up at exactly 3:17 a.m., every single night. No sound, no nightmare — just boom, eyes open, wide awake.
At first I thought it was stress. School, family stuff. But then I started noticing small things — my door cracked open, even though I always close it. My desk chair turned around, facing my bed. I even found my closet door slightly open a couple times, even though I never leave it like that.
I live with my mom. She works overnight shifts sometimes, so I’m home alone a lot. I thought maybe I was just freaking myself out. But then, one night, I woke up and my room felt... wrong.
Not scary. Just off.

I sat up in bed, and I swear to God — I heard a soft click, like the sound of a phone camera.
I froze. Didn’t move for maybe a full minute. Then I slowly reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up. No notifications. But the battery was at 1%. I’d charged it fully before bed.
I opened my camera roll.
There was a new photo. Taken at 3:17 a.m.

It was me. Asleep.

But here’s the thing: the angle wasn’t from the nightstand. It was taken from the corner of my room — where my closet is.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I sat there holding a baseball bat until sunrise.

Mom said it was probably some glitch, or maybe I accidentally triggered it. But I know how that photo looked. I know I didn’t take it.

I deleted it, reset the phone, everything.

Last night was the first time I slept okay since it happened.

Until I woke up this morning.

And found a sticky note on my desk.

In handwriting that wasn’t mine.

It said:

“You’re a heavy sleeper.”"
"Warning: This story isn’t super scary—I just need some advice 😅

It all started when I was sitting on the couch upstairs. It was quiet. My sisters were in their rooms, and my mom was working a late shift.

At around 10:30 PM, I suddenly heard the sound of the front door jiggling. Curious (and kind of nervous), I hopped downstairs and looked through the peephole. Nothing. It was cold and empty outside—not a single person in sight. Not even the neighbor across the street, the one who’s usually out working on his custom-seated Lamborghini. I often pass him on my occasional walks near the lake.

A few minutes later, the door jiggled again. And again. This kept happening, every so often, for a couple of weeks. It’s gotten to the point where I still hear it at night while trying to sleep—along with the low hum of a motorcycle outside.

One day, I asked my older sister, “Did you hear that?” as she came out of her room.

She looked confused. “Hear what?”

“The door handle,” I said. “It was jiggling.”

She shook her head. “Nope. Didn’t hear anything.”

But I know it’s getting louder.

I keep checking outside, but tonight I decided to just stay on the couch and try recording the sound. No one hears it but me. No one believes me.

Just now, I heard the door creak. And right now… there’s a light scratching sound.

So I’m asking you—
Should I open the door?"
"⚠️Fake story⚠️


Ok, you are Anastasia and you have a younger sister named Genevieve

Your parents are on a work trip for a week and you have to survive.

☘️-you survived!
🌼- you survived, but just barely.
🌹-you died. RIP

Keep in mind, 

you must always sleep before 12 AM.

The color orange is forbidden in your house- I wonder why.

You are allergic to strawberries.

Never keep the lights on after leaving a room.


NIGHT 1: unlocked 🔑

you and your sister are sitting on the couch, watching TV. It’s 10:30.

Genevieve: “Ana (your nickname), I am hungry.”

you go to the fridge and see a couple of ready-made things. You grab the last pizza slice for your sister. Now what shall you eat?


-A left-over strawberry cake slice that your sister’s friend made. 🍰

-Some Doritos 🍟

-Nothing. 


🌹-Cake. You are allergic to strawberries! 😔

☘️-Doritos. They were tasty and kept you full! 😁

🌼- Nothing. You’re okay, but you’re hungry. Eat soon dear. ☺️


(It’s late so I’ll finish night one tmmr!)



Your sister thanks you and hugs you. Both of you eat and continue watching TV. It’s 11:45 now. What shall you do now?


-Get ready for bed

-continue watching TV 




☘️-You are your sister got ready for bed and are about to go to sleep.

🌹-The clock ticks 12. RIP.



NIGHT 2: Unlocked 🔑


You wake up and hear your sister already in the kitchen. She left the bathroom light on. You hear soft footsteps coming from above you-almost as if from your attic. What do you do?


-Panic and yell for her

-quickly turn the lights off

-hide





🌼-You yelled for your sister. It heard you but your sister was fast enough to run to you and turn it off.

☘️-you quickly turned the lights off and heard a hiss coming from the attic. The footsteps stopped.

🌼-you hid and saw the familiar painting from your attic spawn on the wall behind you and suck her in. Your sister is dead.





Only for people that chose the third option:

You went outside to the kitchen and looked at the painting. It was your sister crying in a orange cage. You finish grieving and crying.



You decide to go take a shower. What will you wear?




-Jeans and a crop-top

-an oversized pink shirt with jean shorts 

-an orange hoodie with sweatpants






☘️-cute! :)

☘️- aww great choice 

🌹-the similar painting sucked you into it. You died too.




you decide to make breakfast, what will you make?



- strawberry pancakes 🥞 

-eggs and bacon 🥓 

-waffles 🧇




🌹-you are allergic to strawberries 🍓!

☘️-tasty! ^^

☘️-yum! ❤





After breakfast, you watch TV for a bit and time passes super fast. It’s 5 PM a now. You decide to take a nap

I can tell you a scary story but like it’s not real “so once me and my friends were watching scary stories and we wanted to try them so we searched up abandoned places and then we found one so we headed there when we were their bit when we got there we heard nosies and discussed that we should split up then we couldn’t find anything so we went to together and then two of my friends started acting weird and asked crepey questions like is your moms name do you eat fingers and we got scared and ran from them and we heard screams they they….. were dead so we were scared and didn’t split up so then we hid in a abandoned classroom and outside was…. a a monster no body no legs just a head arms a hand and face we were scared but she got in the classroom and time was up we we died” ALSO JUST TO JET YALL KNOW THIS IS NOT A REAL STORY!
"Just know that this is a true story and i don’t have any hallucinations unless i’m having a migraine. When i was 10 i was sitting in my room peacefully when all of a sudden i hear a duct tape sounding noise. Nobody was duct taping anything at all or anything that could cause the noise. Later that day, my parents came home around 7:00 pm and i heard the sound that goes off when the garage is opened. So i went downstairs and opened the garage door (which also sets off a sound btw) but i saw nothing in the garage besides a random red light in the air. So, thinking i was just hearing things, i closed the door. Not long after my parents came to me and asked whether i opened the door or not. Of course, i said yes and also said that i closed it because i didn’t see anything. My mother looked confused because she heard the door open and saw it, but didn’t see me.
When we were going to bed i decided to sleep in my parents room because i felt uneasy after what had happened. Randomly at midnight our pitbull started barking nonstop. There wasn’t anything outside. No odd sounds, not even a bug. And she only barks when she sees something that she’s scared of or when there was someone near me. Eventually she randomly just stopped and fell back asleep. That night none of us could fall back asleep from fear."
⚠️ scary! ⚠️ one day i came back to school to lie down in the weekend I played games relaxed and everything then I looked at the clock that it was late so I had to go sleep them just before I went to sleep finally after a short day I saw what day it was and I was terrified to see it was school tomorrow.
so my chair was moving
it was
I was playing Roblox with Zaina and Charlotte then after like 4 or 10 minutes Charlotte went to the bathroom to go wash her hands she came back and we played a little bit more…… we all heard something and screamed
"True stroy that happened to me:


So first, let me say, im a big extrovert and will talk to literally anyone!
Okay, so i was at the park on holdiay with my family, and i went up this guy at one of the benches, he was alone watching the kids, and said to him, ""Hello, where are your children, i want to play with them 😊?"" Or something like that lol so i went back to my mum, and she asked me,""What did you say to him? ""I asked him who his children were!"" My mum then said, ""Who are his children then?""He doesn't have any. he's here alone. "".... when i was younger, i didn't think anything of it, but now....thats just messed up...."
"short story but a big plot twist…..
a girl was getting ready in her room when her mom said “sweetheart come down for dinner” the girl started walking down the stairs when someone grabbed her ankle. it was her mother and her mother said “i heard that too.”"
Labubu is the right? Your kids have a chance od dying
"True story 



I was at my friends house and we thought it would be really funny to download a ghost app on her iPad, as we played around with it for a while I began to feel a bit sick so I just had a minute to myself. When I was in the room by myself I wondered was that ghost game real or fake , I thought it was fake but then when I felt better I went to play it again and it told us its name its name is daisy, I could feel something on my neck then we asked are you touching my neck , it didn’t reply, it said daisy is sitting with us , I said aww I think daisy is nice then I felt a warm breath then we asked if there is any other spirits it said Ed and I asked is he nice , after a second it said no and my friend felt cold air I got scared and said we should have a break and then we stopped and we were just watching our phones , me and my friend both heard banging . I asked can we sleep in the guest bedroom tonight she said yes but when we were sleeping I woke up to three loud bangs my friend also woke up but she was to tired so she went to sleep pt2??"
"Pt 2 

After she went to sleep I saw a dark shadow figure in the corner , I got scared but I didn’t want to show my fear so I just kept trying to fall asleep. My friend also has a little push thing from when she was a baby and I heard it rattling next to me , I covered my ears and went to sleep . The next morning I felt restless and told my friend what I saw last night my friend didn’t believe me , she said it was just daisy (her spirit guide) but I had seen daisy before and she doesn’t normally show herself if shadow form. Also Daisy tends to stay in my friends room , daisy likes to use my friends makeup because my friend woke up one morning and her makeup had moved around . But that shadow had deep eyes and didn’t have a good feel when I saw it ."
"Pt 3 


I searched up Ed and Ed gein came up I clicked on it and turns out he’s a serial killer he also confessed he killed 2 woman he does not like woman and he tried to kill Kelsi Davies by twisting her neck he also killed his mother and took off her skin and put it on himself he called it his woman suit , he wore it to kill other people cuz at that time people didn’t think girls could kill I went to my friends house again and we asked to talk to Ed , I asked Ed if that story was true and a 
dark shadow stood at the door then the 
spirit app said he’s here , me and my friend 
did some praying to our spirit guides then 
we asked will he hurt us daisy and Isabelle (my spirit guide) said they will protect us so he can’t do anything pt 4??"
"Pt 4 



I told my friend about this and she was nervous I knew that Ed couldn’t do anything to us so I stood my ground and talked to him"

"Here's one:

The old mansion had been abandoned for decades, its grandeur and beauty slowly being consumed by the passing of time. The once-lush gardens were overgrown with weeds, the sound of crickets and the creaking of trees were the only signs of life.

As I stepped inside, a chill ran down my spine. The air was thick with dust and the stench of decay. I began to explore, my footsteps echoing off the walls.

I stumbled upon a room that seemed frozen in time. A grand piano sat in the center, its keys yellowed with age. But it was the photographs on the walls that caught my attention. They were pictures of a family, smiling and happy. But as I looked closer, I noticed something off. The faces were all distorted, as if they were screaming in terror.

Suddenly, I heard a faint melody coming from the piano. It was a haunting tune, one that sent shivers down my spine. I turned to see a figure sitting at the piano, playing with ghostly fingers. The music grew louder, more intense, and I felt myself being drawn closer.

As I approached, I saw the figure's face. It was one of the faces from the photographs, distorted in a scream of terror. The music stopped, and the figure turned to me. Its eyes were black as coal, and they seemed to bore into my soul.

I tried to run, but my feet were rooted to the spot. The figure began to play again, the music growing more frantic. I felt myself being pulled into the piano, the keys closing in around me like a trap.

And then, everything went black.

When they found me, I was catatonic, my eyes wide with fear. The mansion was quiet once more, the piano silent. But some say that on certain nights, you can still hear the haunting melody, and see the figure playing with ghostly fingers.

Hope that gave you chills!"
2 days ago at least for me i was over at my neighbors house which I have a friend named Sierra and she's like 2 minutes away from my house if I were to ride my bike which I always ride my bike and when I was over there we were playing around you know playing in the grass and I did not see this but there are these two boys that past us like 6 times in a row I did not pay attention and so when I was time for me to come home I was riding my bike like usual to my house and those two boys were at a tree with their bikes parked just sitting there and they just looked at me I way to them and continued driving home and then when I was going up the driveway I didn't notice this but they were riding their bikes towards me but I got inside a time before they were able to reach me and 10 minutes later I come outside and I see three police cars talking to those two guys and so yeah and now I'm afraid to go outside every day because they were arrested but they were only warned not to do it again😢

"I know you all have been seeing those comments “ true story.” They might sound fake, but listen to mine. 
I was at school, it was just a couple months before it was gonna end. My friends wanted to skip class since it was our last year at that school,  I didn’t participate at all since I knew it was bad. Since I didn’t do it, they made a plan to not skip, but do a challenge. The challenge was who ever can make a random person at the school they don’t know smile, wins the challenge. Who ever does it last, must go to school after dark. Now of course our school aloud this so this isn’t a bad idea dw. Since we have night events and stuff our teacher said it was okay, unless we do bad stuff. But, my friend Mia made someone smile first. I did it second, and Lia did it last. She was a shy person, so we agreed all to go. My friend Mia’s mom dropped us all off there. The swings were dark. Anyway, we didn’t plan to go inside, but the door was open. We went into the girls bathrooms and honestly too scared to go back. We all got into one stall. We were whispering so no one in case could hear us. “ wait guys” Mia said interputting. We all stopped talking, we heard scratches at the near by classroom, not sure which one though. We got so scared. we started hearing the swing move. Remind u this isn’t fake. we made a run for it too scared to look behind us. we ran out the building into the street nearby houses. We actually looked back and saw the swing swinging. We weren’t sure if it was the wind. My friend Lia was sure she saw legs. We hurried into the car and drove home, that night we had a sleepover. We told everyone but they thought it was fake."
Do you hear the whistle?
No

"It was a dark, stormy night, and Jake was home alone. Suddenly, he heard a creak upstairs. Grabbing his flashlight, he cautiously climbed the stairs. At the top, he saw a shadowy figure standing in the hallway. His heart pounding, Jake whispered, “Who’s there?”

The figure slowly turned around—and it was just his cat, Mr. Whiskers, wearing a tiny Dracula cape.

Jake sighed in relief and laughed. “You scared me more than any ghost could!”

Mr. Whiskers yawned and knocked over a vase, shattering it with a crash.

Jake groaned, “Great, now I have a haunted house and a destructive pet"

"Hey my name is Fale (remember this is a story)
I’m just a normal teenager living a normal life. But
I couldn’t close my eyes when I was trying to sleep
One day. I kept hearing laughs and giggles. I thought
I was dreaming. So I just laid their thinking I was asleep.
But that kept going on and on. Then later, I started to
See people with longer necks and bigger smiles, and
A pale skin with the same face as other people. It felt
Like a dream. Soon I started seeing my objects flying
And going through other stuff. I thought I was dreaming 
I still think I’m dreaming now and it’s not fake. So I 
Went outside for a walk but my legs gave up and 
I couldn’t walk anymore. I still could walk a bit like,
Go to different rooms and stuff, but something 
Feels off about me. So I went to the trip to a 
Museum. It was all white with people wearing
Masks and gloves. It was cool. I saw cool
Sharp things with needles and yeah. So 
My parents told me to sit on one of the cool
Beds so I did. They said: “put this mask
On it makes you look cool.” So I did I slowly 
Closed my eyes and opened it again. I could 
Finally blink again. So I my head started buzzing?
I don’t know. It felt weird and my face felt weird.
My chest didn’t move so I was confused before
I said I’m confused red liquid started coming
Out of the employees body. I thought it was
Cranberry juice (my favorite) so I drank it.
Soon the employee fell asleep. Soon a weird
Black guy came and had a biigg smile so I smiled
Back.  He had a bigger smile than mine. I thought
He was welcoming me. Then he took a sharp thing 
-and but it on my chest. I was so happy that I
Fell asleep- soon he started cutting off my
Skin and started eating it. It tickled a lot!!
He was a funny guy. I miss him soon I opened my eyes
To see my parents! I said hi but they weren’t 
Moving, just. Smiling. So I got out of bed 
And the place was all black I was so confused 
But it w@s okay. I saw other people taking a 
Ride on their beds! That seemed fun.

"FAKE STORY!!    

one night a girl entered a subway and immediately had a bad feeling about it because there was an old lady staring at her and a man sitting beside the old lady. As time went on the old lady didn’t take her eyes off her and it seemed that she wasn’t even blinking. A couple stops later a guy got on the subway and sat down beside her. This made her even more creeped out. Then at the next stop the man sitting next to her grabbed her arm and dragged her off the subway. But for some weird reason, she felt a relief.. 

She tried to run and get away but she ran into a dead end. The man had followed her and had told her, “I didn’t mean to scare you but I had to get you off that train.” She said, “What? What do you mean?” And he said, “That lady who was staring at you wasn’t actually staring..she was dead. And the man beside her..had k*lled her, and you were next…

Stay safe everyone!❤"

"Ok so before I tell you this story, just know it is a ⚠️ TRUE STORY! ⚠️

So one time, I was skateboarding with my younger brother, and I texted my best friend, “Ella” and asked if she wanted to come hang out with me and my brother, she didn’t reply, but, I just assumed she was busy…?
But then, about 6 minutes later, I saw her walking towards me from her house. I waved to her, and said, “Hey Ella!” She then said, “Hi!” As she continued to walk to me and my brother, my brother then said he needed help with something, I then turned around to help him, I think he needed help with his skateboard but anyway, as I turned back around, Ella was gone…..
I just figured she went back to her house to grab something, cause she lives 3 houses down from me. But anyway, she called me 3 minutes later, and said, “Hey Val! Sorry I just saw your text, I just got out of the shower, and when I get ready, yes! I’ll come hang out with you!” I was frozen in shock..
“What do you mean…you just got out of the shower? I saw you walking to my house, and suddenly, as I turned around to help my brother, you disappeared…?”
Ella didn’t say anything for a sec…
“What do you mean, Val? I just got out of the shower, and I DIDNT walk towards you and your brother…?”
I was confused…
“So your saying you DIDNT just go outside, walk on the sidewalk, and suddenly, disappear??” I asked.
“No! I didn’t go outside ONCE today!” Ella replied. I hung up the phone. I didn’t know what to do… if that wasn’t Ella walking to my house, then, who was it…?
And I definitely knew it was Ella, cause she had the same exact voice, and she looked EXACTLY like Ella! But… Ella already said it wasnt her……??? So….
As she arrived at my house, we talked through it, wondering what the heck it was, cause it wasn’t Ella! She already confirmed that WASNT her! And Ella doesn’t lie….
Ever since that day, me and her have always been so confused, wondering what the heck it was.. I told my parents, but they didn’t take it seriously… they just thought I was being funny, but no! It was true! So, anyway, I still have no idea what it was… a clone of my best friend…..???
Idk…..

Anyway, ⚠️ TRUE STORY ⚠️
Pls like this took a while! (Not forcing)"

True story: once I was at the park (I was 11) when a man in all black was walking a short distance behind me. I felt uncomfortable because I was alone and I kept staring at him. He smiled and me and signaled for me to come over to him. I did not trust that man for a second and I took off sprinting. I ran the fastest I have ever ran. I ran back to my house. I was crying and disturbed because the man was chasing me. I still am traumatized because he also now knows where I live.

"The old house stood on a hill overlooking the town, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out at the world. Locals whispered stories about it, tales of a family who had vanished without a trace decades ago, leaving behind only their belongings and an unsettling silence.
Sarah, a thrill-seeking photographer, dismissed the rumors as folklore. Drawn by the house's decaying grandeur, she obtained permission to photograph the interior for a local historical society. Stepping inside, the air was thick with the scent of dust and something else… something faintly metallic and unsettling.
Sunlight struggled to pierce the grimy windows, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with her every movement. In the living room, a half-finished game of chess sat on a dusty table, the pieces frozen in a silent standoff. Upstairs, in what must have been a child's room, a rocking horse swayed gently, though no breeze stirred the heavy curtains.
As Sarah moved through the house, snapping photos, she began to feel a prickling sensation on the back of her neck, the feeling of being watched. She’d whirl around, but find nothing but shadows and stillness. The silence of the house was oppressive, broken only by the occasional creak of the old floorboards beneath her feet.
In the master bedroom, she found a diary lying open on a bedside table. The last entry was dated the night before the family disappeared. The handwriting was frantic, the words scrawled in haste: ""It's in the walls… I can hear it scratching… it knows our names…""
A sudden, sharp scratching sound echoed from within the walls beside her. Sarah froze, her heart pounding in her chest. The scratching grew louder, more insistent, moving closer. It sounded like claws dragging against wood, accompanied by a low, guttural whisper that seemed to slither through the very air.
Terror seized her. She backed away slowly, her camera clattering to the floor. The"

"It was supposed to be a peaceful hike. Ethan and Emma had been best friends for years, sharing countless adventures and stories. They'd explored forests, climbed mountains, and wandered through valleys—nothing had ever scared them. That is, until they decided to hike the Hollow Path.

The Hollow Path was a trail known among locals for its eerie history. Legends spoke of strange disappearances, of people who’d ventured deep into the forest and never returned. But these were just stories, Emma thought, as she adjusted her backpack and grinned at Ethan, who was already ahead on the path, his headlamp flickering in the gathering twilight.

""Come on, slowpoke!"" Ethan called back to her.

""Give me a second,"" Emma said, looking around. The trees surrounding them were thick and twisted, their branches gnarled and reaching like skeletal hands. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves.

The sun had already begun setting, but they were only about an hour into their hike. They’d planned to reach the old cabin before dark, but Emma couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. She pushed the thought aside. It was just the woods—people got spooked by them all the time.

Ethan was already ahead, his headlamp casting eerie shadows on the trees. As she caught up, Emma noticed something strange. The path was narrow, bordered by high, dense trees that seemed to press in on them. The wind had picked up, rustling the leaves, but there were no birds. No insects. Just an unsettling silence.

""Hey, Ethan, have you noticed how quiet it is?"" Emma asked.

Ethan looked over his shoulder, a slight frown on his face. ""Yeah. It’s too quiet. But it's probably just the storm rolling in.""

Emma nodded, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

As the path narrowed further, the trees seemed to grow darker, the shadows longer. Emma reached for her phone to check the time, but it was dead. Strange. She had charged it before they left.

""We should be close,"" Ethan said, more to himself than to Emma. ""The cabin's just up ahead.""

They continued walking, the eerie quiet growing more oppressive by the second. The air had turned cold, a chill that cut through their jackets. Emma shivered, pulling her coat tighter around her.

""Do you hear that?"" Emma asked, her voice trembling slightly. She stopped in her tracks.

Ethan glanced back. ""What? I don’t hear anything.""

""No, listen. It sounds like—""

A low growl echoed through the trees, followed by the unmistakable sound of twigs snapping under heavy footsteps.

Emma's heart raced. ""What the hell was that?""

Ethan's face paled, but he tried to mask his fear with a chuckle. ""Probably just a bear or something. Let’s keep moving.""

Emma wasn’t so sure. The growl had been too deep, too unnatural. And then there was the way the trees seemed to move around them, as though they were closing in. Her mind raced through every story she had heard about the Hollow Path—disappearances, strange creatures, and whispers in the night.

""Maybe we should turn back,"" Emma said, her voice shaking. ""This doesn’t feel right.""

But before Ethan could respond, the growl came again—closer this time. Louder. And then a rustling in the bushes behind them.

Ethan’s eyes widened. ""What the hell is that?""

Before they could react, a shadow darted between the trees. It was quick, almost too quick to see. But it was large. Larger than anything they had seen before. Emma's breath caught in her throat.

""We need to go. Now,"" Ethan said, grabbing Emma’s arm.

They turned to run, but the path had changed. The trees, which had once stood tall and firm, were now bent at odd angles, blocking their way. The narrow path was now a maze of thorns and twisted branches. The growling grew louder, closer.

""Run!"" Ethan screamed.

They pushed through the thorns, branches tearing at their clothes, but the growling was right behind them. The air was thick with a terrible presence, the very woods seeming to come alive, intent on trapping them. Emma could barely see through the tears in her eyes, her heart pounding in her chest.

Suddenly, Ethan stopped. ""Emma, look!"" he shouted, his voice filled with terror.

Emma followed his gaze. In the distance, just beyond the twisted trees, stood a figure. It was tall, unnaturally tall, with long, sinewy arms hanging loosely at its sides. Its face was featureless, a dark void where eyes should have been. Its skin was pale, almost translucent, and it seemed to shimmer in the dim light.

""Is that… a person?"" Emma whispered, her voice barely a breath.

Ethan’s voice was thick with fear. ""That’s not a person.""

The figure moved, and the earth seemed to tremble with each step. It was getting closer.

""We need to move!"" Emma cried.

But as they turned to run, the path before them vanished. There was no way out. They were trapped in the forest, surrounded by darkness and the sound of the creature's growls.

A voice, distant and cold, whispered from the trees. ""You shouldn’t have come here.""

Ethan and Emma spun around, but no one was there. The voice seemed to come from everywhere at once.

The creature was closer now, its presence overwhelming. It moved with unnatural speed, and before they could react, it was upon them. Its cold, ghostly fingers wrapped around Ethan’s wrist, dragging him toward the void of its face. Ethan screamed, his eyes wide with terror, but Emma could do nothing but watch as he was pulled into the darkness.

""Don’t!"" she screamed, reaching out, but her hand passed through the air where he had been.

And then, as quickly as it had all begun, the creature was gone. The growls faded, and the oppressive silence returned. The trees were once again still, and the path, though still dark, seemed almost… normal.

But Emma was alone.

Her chest heaved as she tried to make sense of what had just happened. Was it a dream? A nightmare? Had it been real?

A rustling in the bushes behind her broke her thoughts. She spun around, her heart pounding. But there was nothing there.

Nothing but the cold wind, the dense forest, and the empty path.

She was trapped, with no way out.

And then she heard it.

The same growl.

This time, it was coming from behind her."

"TRUE STORY

Sometime of October on a friday i was in class, and our teacher decided we were behaving good enough for her to put on a movie. I cant remenber exactly but i think it was Halloween town that she put on. Anyway, i was just sitting in the corner of the room, tucking my legs to my chest, and i eventually fell asleep, which doesnt often happen to me. Eventually i wake up to the classroom empty, all the lights on, and the smartboard turned off. (Fyi for this next part my classroom has a fire escape door) So i get up and walk to the window TO SEE IT BASICALLY FLOODING OUTSIDE, plus the bottom step of the fire escape door completely fucking submerged. I glance at the clock, and its like 3:30 or smth, which is far past the time we get out of school. Really felt like i was in some liminal ass prison. One thing i still dont get is that no one noticed i was in the corner. Anyway i walked home in the pouring rain as usual. This was last year btw."

"⚠️TRUE STORY⚠️




about 2 years ago when i was ten years old, i always used to have trouble sleeping, so sometimes

i would always wake up in the middle of the night, and one night it was different.... i had fallen

asleep watching a tv show, and a few hours later or something, i woke up but immediately i felt

something looking at me, it was sitting on my headboard staring at me, so i didnt open my eyes 

and petended to be asleep, and i COULDNT MOVE not at all, and i just stayed still, i was literally 

paralysed, so after a few minutes, i felt that i could move my arms a bit, so i covered my face with 

the blanket very slowly, so that the thing didnt know i was awake, and just waited for the thing to 

leave, and as soon as it left, i could move, so i was like paralysed but i could move a little bit, so i 

waited a few minutes and then pulled te blankets, down and bolted off my bed and into the living 

room, i was so scared that i was trying not to cry, and my mom woke up and i ran to her room, 

and she asked me what was wrong, so i told her also while trying not to cry, and she just hugged 

me, and let me cry on her shoulder, it was terrifying




So thats the story of how i got paralysed😁"

"A story that people think is a hoax or a real thing:
Tons of supernatural events that took place in a London home between 1977 and 1979. The events involved a single mother and her two daughters who reported seeing furniture move and hearing strange noises. 

In August 1977, Peggy Hodgson called the police to her home at *** Green Street in Enfield, London.
Peggy reported seeing furniture moving and her daughters Janet and Margaret hearing knocking sounds.
A police officer reported seeing a chair move by itself.
Other claims included thrown toys, overturned chairs, and children levitating.
More than 30 people, including neighbors, paranormal investigators, and journalists, reported seeing and hearing these events.
Janet Hodgson sits in her home in Green Street, Enfield, on Feb. 17, 1978. Janet would often go into a trance-like state where she would speak in a deep, scratchy voice, claiming to be the ghost of a man named Bill Wilkins, who had died in the house years before.
After a year and a half of activity, the phenomena at the Enfield house abruptly came to an end. No one knew why, but these sorts of hauntings are common with poltergeists: they stop, they start, and the family gets back to normal.
Then the story was covered in the Daily Mirror newspaper until 1979.

This all started from an Ouija Board.

The story is called ""The Enfield Poltergeist""

[August 5 1973]

One night a mom and there kids where driving  it was going all while they where driving they drove near some forest while one of the kids was looking through the window he saw a black figure with red eyes and a big grin the figure seemed to wave slowy at the kid and when they drove past when they arrived home the kid told his mom what he saw the mom didn't believe him the mom told the kids to get ready for bed the kids got ready for bed while they where sleeping the kid heard some foot steps near his room"
"One time I was chilling in my room, when I had this weird idea do randomly do a drawing contest with this random kid a found online. I drew this squid, I was super pleased with how it turned out, but I was shocked to see a picture of what looked like a guy sitting on my literal door step, with a picture of weird figure but I could almost recognize someone in it, later that some day, I found a old plush that had the same feature as the drawing, and the next day saw the same plush at my friends place, and I saw it again at a gas station, but there was something with those eyes that were messed up. Then I had a dream about those same eyes looking back at me, these days I can never find the same plush"
"Based on a true story!

In 1912, worlds longest, luxurious ship was launched called RMS TITANIC. It coild carry around 3000 passengers in it. It was known as ""The Ship of Dreams"" and it really was. It lights glowing at night showing its beauty. But on that night only something worst happened. The RMS TITANIC was on its Maiden voyage from Southhampton, U.K. to New York, America. It was carrying 1,512 passengers it including the crews. It only had 20 emergency boats because the president declared it as the Unsinkable ship. As it departed from Southampton, the water started flowing beautifully. At night of 14 april time around 11 pm, an Iceberg was saw (Its name was Rehorek Iceberg) and struck it which caused it to sink. Now the was designed that even if 4-5 compartments was filled it water, it would still reach its destination properly, but the iceberg strucked the ship so hard that it filled 6 compartments which caused its bow to sink. At the night 1 am, its backside came up from the water. And 12 mins after it was pulled up, the ship broke into 2 pieces and while its backside was coming down, it killed many people with its fans that help it to move. At around 2 am it fully sank. Only 512 people were saved by RMS CARPATHIA. The RMS CARPATHIA came around 4 am after receiving distress signal from RMS TITANIC. But the others, sadly passed away. . . Rest In Peace, RMS TITANIC  and the others who passed away in this worst sinking in the history. . .

"True story: In 2014, a family bought their dream home in Westfield, New Jersey. It was a beautiful six-bedroom house, perfect for raising their children. But before they could even move in, strange letters began arriving in their mailbox.

The first letter was polite but unsettling. It was from someone calling themselves The Watcher. The letter claimed the house had been watched for decades, and now it was the family's turn to be observed.

Then the letters got worse. The Watcher knew the family’s names, the layout of the house, even where their children slept. One letter asked: ""Do you know what’s in the walls? Have they told you yet?"" Another said: ""I am pleased to know your names now, and the names of the young blood you have brought me.""

The family never spent a single night in the house. Terrified, they tried to sell it, but rumors spread, and no one wanted it. To this day, the identity of The Watcher remains unknown, and the house still stands, waiting… watching."

We went to my room and decided to stay up all night suddenly my friend Olivia went to the bathroom. She came out 30 minutes later. She was acting very strange. She sat on the floor in the corner and opened her eyes wide. I started to cry with my friend. I walked over to her and was like are you OK, she didn’t respond but just opened her eye and looked at me like a little creepy shit. 5 AM Olivia finally turned back to normal and said she had no memory of it and said that she was acting normal.

Once there was a little girl named Aveline.

"(This is not real) there were 3 boys, one boy went on a trip to the woods, the others stayed at the house, while one of the boys was in the forest, he saw deer antlers, but they unusually could reach to the branches, when the boy peered out behind the tree, he saw a spiky tail with fur at the tip of it, he saw a wendigo, and the jaw for the skeletal face of the wendigo was split in half, the man ran, but the long claws of the wendigo caught up to him, the wendigo crushed the boy, then the wendigo used some quills near its head to spot the other boys, the wendigo had the arms like the indominus rex, the quills on its head were just like the indominus rex quills, the wendigo saw the boys and killed them, some people say that you can find the house on google maps, though it looks abandoned and there’s also claw marks, but that’s just an abandoned house that had a big arm of squirrels that destroyed the house until their dog stepped in and killed them all, that was from 1954!

"A hiker decided to go on a hike by himself. Something he was not very used to. The whole day was normal. Trees and bushes engulfed his surroundings. He enjoyed being outdoors in the mountains. Nothing seemed strange to him, that was until he was making his way back to his car. He figured an eight hour hike was good enough. The sky was already getting dark and he needed to get back, fast. What was odd was how much he didn’t recognize the trail back. He began to panic.

Night had already taken over and all he had was a flashlight and no clue on how to get back. He knew it was already too late and too dangerous to keep going through the perilous forest. He began to worry that he would have no shelter for the night when almost luckily enough, he stumbled across a broken-down cabin. It was dark, and seemed like no one had visited it in years, but he knew it was the only place where he could rest until daylight, especially since his flashlight was running out of battery. He knocked on the door a few times but no one answered, so he let himself in where strangely enough, a perfect bed fitted for one person awaited him in the center. He knew that if the owner came back he could explain himself, he was sure that the owner wouldn’t mind, or was even probably dead. So he went ahead and got himself comfortable in bed. As he tried to sleep, he couldn’t ignore the collection of paintings around the room; portraits of strange looking people all peering at him, each wearing a smile that sent chills up his spine. Not too long after his  exhaustion from the hike got the best of him and he was able to ignore the faces.

The next morning he got up early and was shocked to see that there were no paintings around the room, but windows…"
"not a true story;

a girl who we will call kayla (10 years) was with her cousins at a cabin. one night they were bored so a girl called jane (13 years) downloaded a ghost tracker and told all the girls that they could look for ghosts just for fun. The rest agreed and they went outside. they expected nothing but to their shock the tracker detected something and stared beeping.  Everyone got scared and moved closer to the bushes (the tracker detected it there) and heard something coming from there. everyone started screaming and ran away to the cabin and left kayla there. Obviously she was scared and started crying until she heard rustling from the bushes. then something jumped on her and took her inside the bushes. the rest of the cousins realized she was missing and went back outside but she wasnt here. all they heard were shrieks and cries from the bushes and decided to go in. but then as they were thinking that she cant be dead since it was her crying, they saw flesh and blood on the floor and hanging from the tree's branches....

One time I want vacation to Hawaii. I always wanted to go to Hawaii and I did but before we’re talking about the flight, we always had little kids that always love to draw a little rainbows on our sidewalks, it was always so frequently so I always expect him to come and I was always scared because you always would come one day when I was going on a trip to Hawaii . I got a notification in mid flight that someone was at my door I figured it was the kids cause I always get notifications about that but I was really curious so I checked it. I saw nothing on the camera so I just figured I might’ve been an error but when we landed to get on my second flight, I got another notification. I thought it was the kids again because they left to get water but it wasn’t. I saw nothing there, but it was strange so I was a shadow, but there was no one there. I figured that the camera was just being finicky and so I guess it was just that, but it kept on happening and happening. It was repeatedly like an amber alert, but instead it was a notification so I checked again and again still a shadow. I was very kind of concerned, but I wanted to make this trip memorable since I have never been to Hawaii and I’d love Hawaii so I can know them. I turn off my notifications and blocked any notifications from that day until I got home from the doorbell app. We’re heading back. I got another notification I had billions of notification on my phone even know why, I looked again. There’s no shadow a smile just staring at my door just a straight smile and it was nighttime. I was freaked out one of the parents because it was just recently, but they said they didn’t see anything then I asked him how any of the kids played out they said no since spin mostly rainy, it was because I kept getting notifications every time we’re about to land we’re about to land. I got another notification instead of just a smile. It was a whole big black figure of a smile. I was so creeped out I called the cops so when I got home, the cops were still there, but nothing was on the door. I told him I showed them proof, but they said it wasn’t true, but I knew it was true cause I got these that I will be going to my house. The kids were really disappointed. They didn’t even know anything about this. I got another notification on my doorbell. I was about to lose it, but then it wasn’t there. No mysterious black figure at all, but then right behind me the black figure was there
















I have never been found….,,,,,…."
"True story!


the seemingly normal town of Ohio, a viral dance trend centered around the catchy ""Skibidi"" tune takes a dark turn when a group of friends discovers an old, disused public restroom known as the ""Skibidi Toilet."" Legend has it that anyone who attempts to perform the Skibidi dance in front of the toilet invokes the spirit of the Rizzler, a mischievous entity that feeds on charisma and charm. When one of the friends, a social media influencer known for his ""W Rizz,"" challenges the rest to film a TikTok in front of the haunted restroom, they unwittingly awaken the Rizzler. As they start to experience bizarre occurrences—distorted reflections in the toilet, eerie laughter, and glimpses of Freddy Fazbear lurking in the shadows—their friendship begins to unravel. One by one, they are ""Fanum'd,"" transformed into uncanny versions of themselves, losing their charm and personalities while becoming trapped in the Backrooms, a liminal space filled with endless hallways and flickering lights. Desperate to escape, the remaining friends must navigate this nightmarish maze, solve cryptic clues related to the Skibidi dance, and confront their deepest fears. They soon realize that the key to breaking the curse lies not just in their moves but in confronting their hidden insecurities and the true meaning of friendship. *Twist:* As they finally face the Rizzler in a terrifying showdown, they discover that the Rizzler is a twisted reflection of their own desires for popularity and validation. To escape the Backrooms and reclaim their identities, they must embrace their true selves rather than the facades they've built online. In the end, they learn that true connection comes from authenticity, and as they dance their way back to reality, they make a pact to keep their lives free from the superficial allure of social media fame. But as they leave the restroom, a shadow lingers, hinting that the curse of the Skibidi Toilet may not be entirely vanquished."

"Real story can’t remember because it was like two years ago, so my old older cousin died in the car accident, but we don’t know how he did. There was no one on the road. I’m not lying. No one was on the road until he felt like that. Someone lifted him up, when I saw him hot in the hospital, he broke his neck. He broke his arm. He even broke his leg. I don’t know how I actually don’t know how he did that part two coming out."
"I was playing on the playground at 3:00am and l saw this person he said ""you want some candy?"" I was nodded yes but l was in a jail cell with dead body's  l think ""am l going to die and spikes was in the wall and then l died."

"For those who don’t understand, the lore of Five Nights at Freddy’s begins with Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a family entertainment restaurant chain featuring animatronic mascots designed to entertain children, but behind the cheerful facade, William Afton, a man later known as the Purple Guy, lured and murdered several children in secret, and their souls became trapped within the animatronics, including Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and later other animatronics, causing them to become haunted and aggressive toward adults in the pizzerias, and over time, multiple incidents occurred, including the Bite of ’87, and the creation of successive generations of animatronics like the Toy Animatronics, Withered Animatronics, and Nightmares, all of which were influenced by the restless spirits of the murdered children, and in FNAF 1, players take the role of night guard Mike Schmidt, surviving attacks from the haunted original animatronics, while FNAF 2, set earlier in 1987, introduces Toy Animatronics and the events leading to the Bite of ’87 as well as showing the history of the original security guards, and in FNAF 3, set decades later, the horror attraction Fazbear’s Fright is created to capitalize on the urban legend of the old restaurants, while Springtrap, the remains of William Afton trapped in a springlock suit after a malfunction, continues to act with malicious intent, and hallucinations of other animatronics appear as phantoms, representing the lingering souls of the children and the effects of Afton’s crimes, and FNAF 4 depicts the nightmares of a child tormented by terrifying, twisted versions of the animatronics, showing how the trauma of the missing children and the history of the restaurants continues to affect those connected to the events, while Sister Location introduces an underground facility with advanced animatronics including Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, and Funtime Foxy, designed by Afton to lure, capture, and experiment on children, and Circus Baby kills Elizabeth Afton, who then becomes a vengeful spirit inhabiting the animatronic, while Michael Afton navigates the facility, surviving animatronic attacks and attempting to undo the damage caused by his father’s obsession with immortality and soul capture, and in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator, Michael lures the haunted animatronics, including Springtrap, into a trap to destroy them in a fire, attempting to free the trapped souls, while Help Wanted expands the story into a virtual reality setting where Afton’s influence persists in corrupted digital spaces, and Security Breach shows a large modern entertainment complex with new animatronics, including Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Montgomery Gator, and Roxanne Wolf, where remnants of Afton’s experiments continue to endanger children and staff, and throughout all games, mini-games, hidden lore, and secret endings reveal the complex timeline of repeated murders, hauntings, and attempts at revenge, showing how William Afton repeatedly tries to manipulate life and death through robotics and soul capture, and the children’s spirits inhabit the animatronics, each with their own story of tragedy, vengeance, and unresolved trauma, and as the series progresses, animatronics continue to be redesigned and reintroduced in new locations, with burnings, collapses, and closures of pizzerias occurring repeatedly, and VR and augmented digital recreations of the animatronics show Afton’s lingering influence across both real and virtual worlds, while hallucinations, nightmares, and glitches reveal the ongoing presence of spirits and the consequences of the Afton family’s actions, and over time, the complex interconnections between William Afton, his children, the haunted animatronics, and the repeated cycles of murder, capture, haunting, and attempted redemption are revealed through cryptic clues, mini-games, easter eggs, and story fragments across every game, showing a chain of tragedies spanning decades, where animatronics continue to act violently due to the spirits within, William Afton continues to manipulate events through his inventions and experiments even after death as Springtrap, and Michael Afton attempts to undo his father’s legacy by confronting animatronics, surviving deadly encounters, and attempting to free the children’s souls from their endless torment, while locations are destroyed, rebuilt, or repurposed, new animatronics are created to continue the cycle, hidden lore emerges showing the full extent of Afton’s crimes, experiments with soul transfer, springlock technology, and the consequences of tampering with life and death, and all of these events intertwine across multiple decades, pizzerias, facilities, underground labs, horror attractions, virtual reality experiences, and modern entertainment complexes, with each incident, haunting, and attempt at closure adding layers to the timeline and showing the deep connections between the haunted animatronics, the murdered children, and William Afton’s manipulations, as well as the repeated efforts of Michael Afton to undo the tragedies and free the spirits while facing increasingly dangerous animatronics, malfunctioning technology, corrupted environments, and the lingering supernatural presence of those lost in the cycle, and despite fires, collapses, digital recreations, and destroyed suits, the cycle of haunting, murder, and attempted redemption continues through new generations of animatronics, new locations, hidden lore, virtual spaces, and the ongoing consequences of William Afton’s obsession with immortality, control, and the capture of souls"
This deserves more likes and replies
This is one of those ‘comment hit late and went to another video’ but like the others I’ve seen. It still makes sense somehow.
"This has the same energy as the FFXIV free trial copypasta, but it's got more meat on the bones."
Ohhh now I understand thank you
"Heres one ""my dad has been calling my name for 3 hours. His eyes are blue."""
so your dad has blue eyes and has been calling for you
​ @mbpyro7157  the persons eyes are green
"Ah yes chickens instead of fish, my worst nightmare.😅"
Are you stupid the fish sushi have no parasites the raw chicken ones can kill someone or make them sit on the toilet for a century
Raw chicken will give you salmonella
These are dumb af 😂
"0/10, not scary, did not flinch. If I had every brain cell, every molecule, every atom, the power of Albert Einstein and the entire world by my side, dead or alive, I could not make this scary. If I spent every fraction of a trillionth of a nano-second for 50 quintillion to the power of 1- google plex, there is no feasible way that I could even make the story a fraction of a trillionth times better. If every single god woke up, every celestial body, every alien, unidentified creature, there is not even a fraction of a billionth of a chance that they could even ATTEMPT at making this story better. In the entire multiverse, if everyone combined every might of their being, this story would be 0.0000000000001% better to the power of 2763 quintillion, honestly, I doubt that it would be any better if you obliterated the entire multiverse of multiverses along with this."
i didnt got anything
Wee wee
So she decided to touch someone named “the moon 😏”
These are so ass
How is the last one a horror thing?😅
"That's what I was thinking. The most that can be said to explain it, is that someone mentioned salmonella poisoning.🤷‍♀️"
The second one was kinda good ngl
Can u explain it please
"​ @Killua2058  The mom and her little boy seem to be hiding from her husband, the boy's dad for some unknown, but terrifying reason. But instead of keeping quiet the boy reveals where he and his mother are, in order to get a gift from his dad. The horror is that the mom was betrayed by her own son, thinking that he needed to be saved by maybe an abusive father, as the man is at least more than likely abusive to the mom, his wife. Now she will more than likely suffer a lot more for trying to get away from that man."
"⁠ @Killua2058 I’m pretty sure it’s about an abusive household, the mother is trying to keep her son quiet while the dad has bribed his son about giving him a game if he found his mom"
Good concept video
999th like
These are lame. They don’t make sense. 🙄
🥲
They do 😂 but you have to be able to think
They require some thought
Theyre all so lame and corny. Almost predictable
Fuck off
It do be like that sometimes
Chicken wings
"Only me and my friend went together to hike in the forest. It was only then I counted how many people were there, I always ended with three."
Ooo creepy
"My dad asked me to be quiet but i didn't listen to him

So he beat the shit out of me"
These are scary like the Lifetime movie channel.
First one ain’t even close to being good
I really didn’t understand is this a reference to to the sponge bob episode
" @oisinlynch8427  if you took your glove off in space or any part of your suit for that matter, you’re fucked"
The void of Space is very cold
" @Raven-d6i1y  exactly, it was so extremely easy to predict and sucked"
Didn't even notice the punchline.
the first one it says sand so maybe they live on the moon and they call earth the moon instead
I don't understand the first one.
​ @IDKwhoknows-x2y  Ohh
"She took her glove off and died quickly because there is no oxygen on the moon. Next children, we will go over the sun being covered in flames."
 @Lt.dannyboy  no I understand it’s just bad
​ @NosloC_subject42 they all sucked tbh. 2 sentence food poison? Weak
⁠ @IDKwhoknows-x2y  you’re thinking way too deep
 @NosloC_subject42  exactly thats the point I just said the first thing I thought
 @IDKwhoknows-x2y  ?
These all suck
These stories are barely even scary
Their are not supposed to be theirs a different
 @HomerSimpson-v9 there’s
"well the second one was about donestic abuse, and childrens obliviousness to relationships and marital aggresion. when thought about, domestic abuse is also taken incredibly lightly, so the man will probably abselutely get away with it, so if taken a certain way its pretty scary. then again, scary is subjective so that was just my  opinion."
"I have some.. 

We keep passing the hitchhiker atleast every 4 minutes.. Maybe I shouldn't have ran her over at the beginning of my trip

If a photo of a person has too many teeth, it's likely ai. But, what do I do if it in person? 

When it seemed like there would be no hope left, I gave the order: women and children first.  My men would need all the food we had left to survive this siege. 

My husband tells me I talk in my sleep,so I set up a recorder to prove he's wrong. When I played it the next morning, all I heard was my own voice telling me to stop recording it. 

She's prettiest when she's alone. I almost don't want her to turn on the light."
second is the only good one
​ @annaprice-v1t  scary is subjective but I know what you meant to say. This is less for you and more for people trying to define words through context clues.
" @TranarchistOG  thanks, my grammar isnt the best lol. fixed it."
Nothing scary about this
💖
I don't get the first one
Can someone explain
Basically her hand froze off as the moon is really cold
I also can't get the second one
⁠ @Spinoyt6166 it’s an abuse father who braided his kid
 @Spinoyt6166  basically the dad tricked the kid into thinking he’d get a game if he found his mom. The dad needed to find both of them so he could…uou could assume
Same but the third one doesn’t even make sence
"⁠ @VirginiaGibson-s9e  raw fish doesn’t harm you, but raw chicken will give you salmonella"
"Y'all are dum as hell, the moon dust is sharp as heck cuz it's not smoothened by air as there is no atmosphere like earth. It's basically small shards with 10X more sharpness and as soon as she touched it, the dust penetrated her skin and will soon reach her heart and stab it million times."
​ @sarahbeth157  are you stupid? Moon isn't cold like that. It's the sand thats scary.
" @SomeBody-_-Yt  or she’ll freeze first, dumb dumb"
"​ @NosloC_subject42  She won't freeze first ok? She's not landing near the poles because humans can't with modern day technology. If you had some braincells and reading comprehension you'd known that it clearly said ""she grabbed handful of moon dust"" Ofc her hand will freeze but not immediately (pretty dumb cuz she's supposed to be an astrophysicist and she's dum as hell here) causing the dust to kill her first due to cardiac cycle which is faster here. Hand freeze won't kill her, moondust will."
 @VirginiaGibson-s9e it’s sense
 @SomeBody-_-Yt  calling someone dumb but spelling it ‘dum’ will forever amuse me 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
"​ @quintinallred  Cuz YouTube sometimes remove it and months later someone else reads the comments and can't understand that the person whose comment was removed, wasn't wrong. Not so bright are you?"
I thought it was she was like a alien touching the ocean sand (beach sand) or smth-
"She took her glove off on the moon, thus depressurizing the suit and sealing her fate."
"​ @NosloC_subject42  Raw chicken looks  NOTHING like raw fish, how would anyone get tricked?"
​ @SomeBody-_-Yt  How the fuck would you survive taking your suit's glove off in the vacuum of space?
"​ @HeirofDacia  never said she would, plus you can't do it anyways, the suit isn't made like that."
😮😮
That’s a recipe for Salmonella in story 3
yup not the fish i think tho

Not scary story just story of lies 😂
Bro the ending got me so creeped out. Plot twist the son was a part of his imagination😂
What is gonna happen to this?
This plot twist is insane
"Theory: The dad was abusive ofc, so he abused his son and friends for being so loud and they died. He feels so bad for them now and he keeps hallucinating a similar situation to what happened. His son and friends are probably mad at him for killing them so they are haunting him as ghosts or whatever, and his son almost made it back into the world but failed because the creepy smile went away."
That smile😂
Oill upppppp
"The explaination is that he is Dreaming about his son....
He has wooped the kid very badly to actually die...
HOPEFULLY U LIKE GYA -"

Man that smile was sent all the way down to my body
So Funny I’m Dying Hahaha 🤣
"Heres it explained if you dont get it:
The dad mentioned was a crazy abusive dad, so it’s most probably that the dad killed his son and his friends. Now, this short is a hallucination of guilt of his previous crimes in which he had committed against his own son and his friends."

Baki
GOOSEBUMPS:)
Bro why did YouTube give me this short in the night
I got fuckin' bad dreams
Story was his dad heard him with his friends one night and his son was hallucinating again (he is schizophrenic) and his dad is annoyed and hits him so hard the neighbours call the police and his son is in a orphanage and his dad is schizophrenic too and still has nightmares about it
"For those who don't get it:

the Dad was hallucinating because he had only
his child after his wife died.. but then.. the kid
had sadly died.. then he heard his son talking 
talking to himself for weeks and months.. but
as soon as the Dad told his Child he should see
a brain doc the friends dissapeared then the kid
dissapeared and the dad knew he halllucinted..

hope this helps"
ew
The story: so the dad was so mad that he accidentally killed his son and his friends so he went drunk and then one day when he was drinking he was hearing his son and his friends so we got his belt and was ready but they started disappearing because they were already dead( hopes this helps)
because i had tingles go down my back
is that a real story
Am guessing the dad didn’t like the son’s friends so he killed them but the son was them cryed tried to tell his dad but he was dr0nk and killed the son making the friends and son into ghosts and hunting him OR he killed the friends and son then he did that and realized he killed him then he killed him self idk it’s just a guess theough
He was weird he was trying touch me🤩😜🔥🔥🔥
You gotta do me like that im bout to go to bed 😭🙏
"For those who dont know, the video said the dad was abusive, so he abuse his son so much he probably killed him, maybe the friends too"
I'm sorry I'm laughing 😭
This is a really sad story
"A short sentence horror for y’all:


For my last wish, I wished my dad to be alive again.

I stood atop his grave and smiled, 
imagining him screaming and clawing at his coffin lid
 as he did the two previous times I wished him back."
"Then he says ""I gotta stop drinking"" and it hits the ""based on a true story"""
"""He disconnected"""

"My own creepy story: 
A father went to say good night to his seven year old son, very well knowing that if he didn’t his son would have trouble sleeping. It was a nightly routine between them. He entered the dimly lit room where his son waited under his blanket. With the first glance the father could tell there was something unusual about his son tonight, but couldn’t put his finger on it. He looked the same but had a grin that drew from ear to ear.

“You okay, buddy?” the father asked.

The son nodded, still with the grin, before saying, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.”

The father chuckled a bit before getting on his knees to check only to satisfy his son.

There, under the bed, pale and afraid, was his son. His real son. He whispered, “Daddy, there someone on my bed”."
who do not understand: the father killed his son and his son's friends and he thought his son was hallucinating but he realized his son is not hallucinating...the dad is hallucinating
Blud got uno reverse 💀
Creepy story be like
1 short before bed “the short💀”
Am i the only one who bursted out laughing when the sons eyes and mouth turned that way?😂😂
If the dad is also not real then who is dreaming all of this 🤔
The dad: Oh wait I don’t have a son-

Im haunted by a skinwalker the skinwalker is my son
Im haunted by a skinwalker the skinwalker is my son

"BEASD ON TRUE STORY...,"
When i was little i was swimming until i drowned and nobody helped me only my Brother
Imagene based on a true story💀
"I'm here to help you with that! Here's a spooky tale for you:

In a remote village nestled among misty mountains 🏞️, whispers of a cursed mansion 🏰 echoed through the cobblestone streets. Locals spoke of a ghostly presence 👻 that roamed the halls at night, weeping mournful cries. Brave souls who dared to enter never returned, their souls trapped within the mansion's walls.

One stormy night, a young traveler seeking shelter stumbled upon the mansion's looming silhouette. Ignoring the warnings, he stepped inside, the creaking door closing behind him. As he explored the dark corridors, he felt an icy chill 🥶 and heard faint whispers in the wind.

Suddenly, a figure materialized before him - the ghost of a grieving woman, her pale face twisted in sorrow. She beckoned him closer, her eyes filled with longing and despair. Trembling, he realized she was searching for something lost in the shadows of the mansion.

Driven by compassion, he offered to help her find peace. Together, they unraveled the mansion's tragic past, uncovering a tale of love and betrayal that bound the ghost to this earthly realm. With each revelation, the mansion trembled, revealing hidden secrets and forbidden truths.

As dawn broke, the ghost finally found solace, her spirit fading into the light. The traveler emerged from the mansion, forever changed by his encounter with the supernatural. From that day on, the cursed mansion stood silent, its ghostly inhabitant at peace.

Remember, sometimes the scariest stories are the ones that touch our hearts 💔."

Song name
"The coffin on wheels:
Long ago, somewhere in russia, in a lonely neighborhood, there was a spoiled girl even tho her family was poor. Once she turned 16, her parents decided to work abroad so they could afford the bills. They left at 6 pm, and it started to get dark. The girl decided to get ice cream even though her parents didn't allow her, and she sat on the couch to watch TV. Shortly after, the TV kept switching into blank channels, and the girl thought it could be a problem with the signal, so she didn't mind at all. Next time, it switched channels again, and this time, it wrote on the screen, ""I am heading towards you"", the girl didn't mind at all. After a while, it switched again. This time, it said her address. The girl thought it would be some kind of joke, so she continued to watch her favorite channel. The next time it switched, it said, ""i am on street 273"" which was a couple of miles away. She didn't mind... next time, it switched and said, ""I am in your neighborhood."" The girl started to get worried since it had just been a few minutes, and the tv won't stop switching to unknown channels.. As the girl finished her 5th ice cream box, she cuddled her favorite toy. The TV switched again and said, ""i am in your stairway"", the girl decided to switch off the TV and hide behind the couch. The tv turned on... The girl held her breath as she heard her apartment door opening. The TV proceeded to say, "" I am in your apartment."" She decided to close her eyes as she heard some wheels screeching and bumping into tables. then she felt some tension beside her, but she dared not to look, and the TV said,'I found you..."" The girl looked rapidly to the side as the coffin attacked her and said,""I got your heart"""
That was good
Imagine if it said based on a true story💀

For those who don’t get it she said if u say someone’s name backwards then they do as you say.  The mom knew that so when Anna was born she named her Anna bc if you say it forward it’s Anna and if u say it backward it’s Anna.   So she’s been controlling her.

Ik most scary stories aren't true but this one rattled me. I'm my mom's favorite child. She says I’m a great listener and always do what I am told. My name is spelt the same way backwards and obviously said the same. I'm not much of a superstitious person but if smth rubs off on a wrong way...

"HiI I have a creepy story 
The air grew thick as the old house settled around me, the creaking floorboards beneath my feet almost seeming to breathe with a life of their own. I hadn’t expected the place to feel alive. It was supposed to be abandoned—empty. But every corner I turned, every room I stepped into, the air felt... wrong. As if something was watching, waiting. In the attic, I found a weathered box with a strange symbol scratched into its lid. It was old, too old, with a smell that made my stomach twist—like something long dead. I hesitated but opened it anyway. Inside, there was nothing but a single porcelain doll, its eyes cracked but still staring, unnervingly wide.

I picked it up, inspecting it closely. Its painted smile seemed too real, too permanent. The floor behind me groaned, and I spun around, heart pounding. There was no one. Just the house, breathing.

I left the doll in the attic, but when I went back downstairs, I could’ve sworn I heard faint footsteps following me—always just a little too far behind. The mirrors in the hallway began to distort, the reflections bending like water, and I felt a cold hand brush the back of my neck. My own reflection grinned at me, though my face remained blank.

I ran. The front door wouldn’t budge. I turned around, my pulse in my throat, and saw the doll on the stairs. It hadn’t been there when I had left. The smile on its face was no longeindow.__oai_logHTML():window.__oai_SSR_HTML=window.__oai_SSR_HTML||Date.now();requestAnimationFrame((function(){window.__oai_logTTI?window.__oai_logTTI():window.__oai_SSR_TTI=window.__oai_SSR_TTI||Date.now()}))"

After she sucídêd her a close friends mom took her all stuff and became my neighbor So like she had a daughter who was close to the girl who sucídêd So her kittens used to rome near my apartment One day I was coming to home from my tution at night my mom was alone at house She told me someone was watching her from behind the door 😢 I was so scared then after some days my mom went back and that day my friends we're coming but they were like 2 or 3 days late I was alone I used to feel like Water tapping in the house behind me that was locked! And I used to hear someone gambling in the tree behind my room I checked The next day but it was nothing So after some days my friends came so one day the girl who was related to the girl who sucídêd went to the terrace alone at like 6 pm and the girls spirit came inside her And she came to my house and told us to go in the park with her we said ok and went with her we ate ice cream then we came home she had tution when her tution teacher came to house she was just laughing like  u know  and pushed her tution teacher then tried to take out the God thread out of his hands and the tution teacher called her mom and said she did this and that they took her to Masdim and the girls spirit went to his father's car and stood there hiding

"The Whispers in the Walls

In a quiet village, there was an old, creepy house that no one wanted to go near. People said it was haunted by a family that disappeared long ago. One stormy night, Aria and her friends dared each other to spend the night inside.

As soon as they entered, strange whispers started coming from the walls. The whispers called out, ""Lila... Lila..."" They followed the sound and found a locked door. When they opened it, there was a dusty mirror inside. The mirror showed the reflection of a family looking scared, trapped inside.

Suddenly, the whispers turned into loud screams. The door slammed shut, and the room became dark and scary. Aria quickly threw something at the mirror, and it shattered with a loud crash. The trapped spirits were finally freed.

Aria and her friends ran out of the house, never looking back. From that day on, they knew the house wasn’t just a story—it really was haunted!"

"I have a horror story called ‘ The cabin ‘ get ready !


A hiker decided to go on a hike by himself. Something he was not very used to. The whole day was normal. Trees and bushes engulfed his surroundings. He enjoyed being outdoors in the mountains. Nothing seemed strange to him, that was until he was making his way back to his car. He figured an eight hour hike was good enough. The sky was already getting dark and he needed to get back, fast. What was odd was how much he didn’t recognize the trail back. He began to panic.
Night had already taken over and all he had was a flashlight and no clue on how to get back. He knew it was already too late and too dangerous to keep going through the perilous forest. He began to worry that he would have no shelter for the night when almost luckily enough, he stumbled across a broken-down cabin. It was dark, and seemed like no one had visited it in years, but he knew it was the only place where he could rest until daylight, especially since his flashlight was running out of battery. He knocked on the door a few times but no one answered, so he let himself in where strangely enough, a perfect bed fitted for one person awaited him in the center. He knew that if the owner came back he could explain himself, he was sure that the owner wouldn’t mind, or was even probably dead. So he went ahead and got himself comfortable in bed. As he tried to sleep, he couldn’t ignore the collection of paintings around the room; portraits of strange looking people all peering at him, each wearing a smile that sent chills up his spine. Not too long after his  exhaustion from the hike got the best of him and he was able to ignore the faces.
The next morning he got up early and was shocked to see that there were no paintings around the room, but windows…

"BRO JUST GO TO THE BASEMENT DANG LIKE STOP QUESTIONING BRO THAT GIRL OR WHATEVER IS ON MY NERVES DANG BRO JUST LISTEN WHAT YOUR MOM SAYS 



if that happens to any of y’all do NOT QUESTION THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME AND YOU WILL DIE just run to the basement but if you don’t have a basement go to the attic or whatever yo say it if you don’t have that just lock yourself in your room and go to the closet and don’t get OUT just call the police 


DONT EVER QUESTION YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT YOU FROM THOSE MEN OR WOMEN THEY WORRY ABOUT YOU




they are facts I guess pretty much don’t you think 💭 hehe





But still it could be serious if your mom or dad or siblings ever say that don’t question them it’s a waste of time just listen to what they say and go.






There
Hope that probably helps in a situation your on anytime"
If this ever happens to you if there is a group of men wearing a mask and black clothes it could be dangerous and serious

Fr like he was doing all that yapping ( I’m super late)
SO TRUE STPID MINDED YOUR NOT FACING THE TRUTH TO IT NOW
It’s scary imagining it
Scary and creepy now I’m scared lol 😆
Same
"Not me bc I love scary things, stories, texts etc."
Plz do a video about a boy telling a girl that he likes her
Lol wt- that happens irl too and Ig there's some txts abt that
*txt stories
"Explanations:-
1)There were supposed to be only two astronauts who accompanied the narrator on their journey, however, something(likely a Skinwalker or another form of Shapeshifting creature) disguised as a human, and no one, except the narrator, seems to realise this fact. Bro fr hit CTRL+C and CTRL+V.

2)I believe that the little girl is a ghost and only shows herself to selective people. Therefore, the doctor can't see the girl, but the narrator and their son can. Ghostbusters time!

3)As told in the story, the husband died last night while having his arms wrapped around the narrator, and due to rigor mortis(Stiffening on muscles after death), the narrator couldn't get away from the dead body. Should have done 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 10km runs since she was a child, smh. 

4)The dog had gone through surgery that basically remove its ability to bark properly. And on that unfortunate day, someone broke into the house, and despite all the dog's best efforts, it just wasn't loud enough to warn its owner. I love dogs and this good boy was trying its best despite the surgery, so I'm not gonna meme him.
Edit:- Honestly, skill issue on the human's side for the last one, they honestly deserve what's going to happen because of what they did to the dog."
"Agreed. If I was the dog I'd be like ""alright die then"" then I'd dip and join a pack of wolves"

" @Trashmantrash  listen here you little $h|7, if another person equates any case of social deduction to among us, I'm going to lose it, IT WASN'T EVEN THAT GOOD OF A SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME, but just because it had chores, and a place where you could move, it became number one, and now all people think about when they hear the word ""imposter"", is that stupid game"
Skin walkers aren't technically shape shifting creatures. They are medicine men who practiced bad medicine and wear the skin of animals to gain the abilities of the animals or be more like them

" @Linki8uu  that's what I meant to say, but I guess I just implied it, but no, town of Salem is most likely not even ONE of the first, I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure there were physical games in the 90s/00s, for example, mafia, that, most likely existed way before among us, and I am almost sure that existed way before among us, and had video game adaptations before it"

​​ @redravenriot3650  it isn't new to any culture and isn't specific to Native American mythos. Ideas of impostors prevail in most cultures.

Omg!!!! I  literally was speaking what you posted about their dog having surgery.... ps: these ere great
"Bro all the dog lost was his bark, small price to pay for cared for your entire life I don’t think it’s right but death is a little far"
 @JAID2X  read Stitchybaby's comment(not in this reply section) about debarking (Starts with Ok don't debark ur dog).
"The fact people here are arguing about among us,the thing, skinwalkers, and Lord knows what else all being a ripoff of the other is insane. Mafia/werewolf came first I'm pretty sure like... Christ"
" @JAID2X  Death is a little far, but a small price is also far from right. Loosing their voice is mutulation that causes great mental distress, and dogs who have been debarked often turn to biting as a last ditch effort to communicate at all. 

Don't go killing for it, but don't undersell it either. There's a reason it's illegal in most of the western world and punishable with a prison sentence."
"​ @empurressNepetaIII  It's okay, you are validdddd


(Asmr voice)"
The dog surgery thing is called de barking it’s when they remove a part of the vocal cords so it can’t bark
Number 1 is bassically just amongus lol
​ @The_Shape24  thats what Im sayin😂

 @Stitcheroo2  w
" @Ash_35098  I don't think they remove part of the vocal cords, I think they just scrape around the insides, permanently scarring and damaging them but either way it's cruel and u shouldn't debark ur dogs. Also apparently some cats meow, like, super loud so u can also debark ur cat (even with cats I believe it's still called debarking)"
" @JAID2X  he lost his bark, but he could have gained a lifetime of pain. Debarking can cause swelling (which can lead to ur dog suffocating bc the throat will swell) bleeding, gagging and coughing which would be extremely painful if ur vocal cords got scraped raw. And barking is part of how dogs communicate. They use it to communicate hunger, discomfort, excitement, and sometimes to alert people of danger. Imagine, if u will, that ur greatest physical asset was ur voice. It's how u communicate ur feelings, it's how u get ur point across, it's how u socialize. Imagine if ur parents thought ur voice was so annoying that instead of teaching u other, nonvocal ways to express urself in certain situations, they decided to pay more money to put u under the knife just to shut u up bc they were too lazy to be a decent person and spend a few hours with u. Now imagine ur a dog who got debarked. If u just so happen to be a very vocal dog like a husky for example, u won't have just lost ur bark, you'll have lost ur entire sense of identity"
There is an imposter among us
That poor dog it had its voice taken away
I cannot agree any more than you do for 5 like who does that to a dog it's like taking out someone's vocal cords because they spoke a bit loud and yes I know it's fiction but can't help but think some do this now
No debarking that is awful and harmful to dogs 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1st is just amongus

Bro are you telling her to be one punch woman?
First one: crewmate there is one impostor among us
The dog one is sad :((
I agreed they had what coming to them for debating their dog. Just some proper training they wont bark so much. But they still will and if you can't handle that then get a pet goldfish. You'll still get robbed but there won't be any animal cruelty
"Man didn’t even just explained the stories naw he roasted everyone in them for nothing, he was blood thirsty"

"For 4, I believe it's a bit of a different case cuz I think the dark figure was some sort of demon/serial killer/thief who was trying to rob or kill the people who lived there but wasn't able to because the dog Charlie kept barking at him. Hence, the reason of the surgery. Charlie's owners were sick of his barking and had him put through a surgery. Then when that guy saw that the dog wasn't barking,he knew he was home-free. Talk about Karma huh?"
"your explanation makes more sense but i like to think for number one, that there are only two astronauts and the third was seen due to schizophrenia or insanity due to being isolated in space for too long"

"Horror aside, removing your dog’s ability to bark is fucking abusive, just train him to chill out instead of ripping out his vocal chords!"
Just learned the dog equivalent of declawing a cat is debarling a dog. :/
Plot twist for that last story best case scenario the dog is stupidly trying to bark at its owners after they went to the bathroom or something worst case scenario their dog is hallucinating and deserves additional physical therapy to fix Its Behavior as well as punishment for trying to be a menace
first comfusing
Before I watched this short I didn't know you could de-bark a dog and I feel sad now :( why take it away from the good boy? Maybe their vocal cords should be taken away
"Yeah, dead husband stories aren't as fictional as you might think.  I know of at least one woman, whose husband had a heartattack during sex...missionary...and she couldn't push him off of her.  Luckily, she could reach the cordless phone on the bedside table."

Poor dog. Just trying to do its job of alerting them but they debarked him
"Bro why is de barking a dog a thing?

Your taking away your dogs voice is horrible and it can hurt them

IT’s simalar to declawing your cat

I don’t care what excuse people have for doing this, it’s all just lazy excuses like train the animal or don’t have one"

Hahahahahaha mysteriously passed away
"""There is 1 Imposter Among us"""
Amogus
First one was an Among us reference
"Unless the dog is cruel (like a psycho eating a baby alive despite being trained and well fed. Yea, every living thing can be evil regardless of how well you raise them) or puts everyone in danger by barking (IDK in what scenario, but I would imagine some shit like the movie where you have to be super silent. In that case, debarking would almost be a must, unless you want your dog and everyone else dead), I don't see a reason why anyone would debark their dogs. Just train them to bark only when needed 'cuz if they bark all the time for no reason, it's like hearing your partner scream into your ear for no reason and you'd eventually slap your partner to get them to stfu, and it'll make their barks meaningless. But if they bark with purpose (seeing a squirrel eating doesn't count), then everyone would know that their barks mean serious business and everyone will attend to the dog when it barks. It's just like having a soft spoken friend who scream and you immediately attend to them vs a screaming annoying karen who you get used to and just ignore overtime."
"The sad part? Charlie was probably debarked because he was barking at the dark figure (which kept said dark figure away) in the first place and the owners got tired of it so they debarked the dog. And because they debarked the dog, the dark figure was able to make its move.

If you wanna make it deeper, maybe the dark figure is someone the owners know and they told the dark figure they debarked their dog and knew they could finally make their move. 🤷🏾"
What's the music called
"Rigor mortis doesn't last forever though, given a couple more hours the muscles relax again and the spouse of the deceased can easily escape."
the way i dont even feel bad for the last one like don't debark your dogs guys
"debarking dogs is so stupid, like why the hell would you hurt it like that.?"
Charlie’s owners got what they deserved
Honestly i rather be murdered in my sleep than be woken up at 4am by the dog barking at a fly

So is eating meat
 @smoothcriminal5650  Wow nice argument that had nothing to do with the conversation!
 @smoothcriminal5650  who asked
"​ @smoothcriminal5650  you broke the chain asshole, also nobody cares"
"​​ @smoothcriminal5650 Dogs eat meat
Also I'm continuing the chain Fr fr"
" @ghifariasoka8272  It is true that dogs meat, but unlike dogs, we have moral agency, the ability to differentiate between right & wrong - this means we have accountability for our actions & should try to reduce the suffering we inflict both unto each other, & other animals. Moreover dogs descend from wolves, that are carnivores, but humans are herbivorous omnivores & can thrive eating vegetarian & plant-based diets."
" @smoothcriminal5650  We still have incisors and fangs/canines, and we need a balanced diet based on both meat and vegetable nutritions. I think most farm animals have reached a point where we can't ""rewild"" them back into nature unless we want to ruin natural habitats/ecosystems, so our most common choice is to eat them"
" @ghifariasoka8272  Other herbivores like the gorilla & sabre-toothed deer also have canines, much sharper than human ones actually. By meat-based nutrition I assume you are referring primarily to protein, & certain micronutrients such as Iron, Zinc, & Vitamin B12. These are found in meat but they are not exclusive to meat, they can also be found in plants & with adequate planning you can be fully healthy if not more on a plant-based diet. The most important advice is to diversify your plants, such as to include nuts, avocados, fruits, vegetables, wheat, lentils, & mushrooms & also prioritise wholegrains like brown rice over white rice for fibre. Meat actually has a lot of cholesterol & saturated fat which is not good for cardiovascular health, & even some carcinogenic compounds such as heme & polycyclic amines. You’re right in that is too late to rewind these animals but a much better solution is just to stop breeding them into existence & let them die peacefully, ideally in sanctuaries. Surely that is better than having your species continually unalived for centuries?

"The first one is brilliant because it not only implies that there is a shapeshifter aboard the craft, but that it could alter their minds so powerfully they forgot it’s existence without committing it to paper."
I'd also like to think that some of the horror is that there is a slight implication that narrator might be a copy but isn't aware of it.
"Wait, the note implies that stuff like this has happened before, so that means that there is likely a second skinwalker."
"Could be, I like that aspect more than the person going insane or something and seeing a person(s) who’s not there"

 @sophthetoast1997  Why Are You Bread
 @Titled  Answer my question first
 @sophthetoast1997  Answer My Question Beforst
The first one is kinda SUS
"4: and then the good boy institute broke down the door to Charlie’s house and came out with the intruder kicking and screaming whilst desperately trying to break his neck free from the gloved hand of an officer. Charlie was saved as all good boys should, and the all loved happily ever after."
The first one seems familiar 🤔
Poor dog
"The only horror in that last story is that [REDACTED] HORRIBLE [REDACTED] ""DEBARKING"" SURGERY THAT [REDACTED] STUPID SURGERY THAT TAKES AWAY THE [REDACTED] ABILITY TO BARK FROM THOSE [REDACTED] AMAZING DOGGOS!
[Redacted] horrible things, deserved it for having the surgery, alot of dogs bark as warnings, like ""hey I don't like this, stop!"" And after the surgery the resort to bitting😞"
Amoung us!!! We must eject the imposter!!!!
Rigor mortis will wear off before a stationary person dies of thirst.
"For the last one, those people deserve it"
SUS
"My little sister woke me up in the middle of the night to ask to sleep with me.



I was dozing off when I realized I didn't have a sister anymore"
Dog’s family deserved it. Maybe the figure was just getting revenge
Amogus
"Debarking your dog is cruel, please don't do it. In cases like these, it could be their only survival method 🙁"
"Don't worry, rigor mortis is temporary."
"Dont you dare think of debarking a dog, its illegal and inhumane"
"Don't debark your Dog, it's very cruel and all you have to do is a little bit of training and teach them not to bark. Don't be lazy, or your dog will literally start biting you"
I laughed so hard at rigor mortis
About the second story..... My name is Annie.
Interesting
Good ending of story 2: she’s a real girl who has been hiding in the house for a while and that boy’s parents adopt her
The first one was amogus
Debarking should be fucking illegal
"I didn’t even know it was a thing, that’s so fucked up

Animals shouldn’t have to be disabled for human convenience"
⁠​⁠ @Sukekiyoki the horrible things who i will not even say are people who debark dogs are just too lazy to train their dogs not to bark.
" @TPOT_pillow  don’t want a pet that barks- don’t get a dog

Don’t want a pet that flies- don’t get a bird

Don’t want a pet with claws- don’t get a cat

People are so cruel and dumb"
don’t want a pet you have to take care of- get a pet rock
"I looked at the metal statue of a women on my counter.

I froze is terror when it’s shadow changed position."
Why you don’t mute your dog:
"I hate it when people take dogs voices, that's how they communicate it's inhumane to do that, if you just took a person's vocal cords out there would be a major outcry for that, and they need their voices for this reason, most dogs will bark at intruders because they don't know if they are safe or not"
Why am I the only one mention how the first one is basically just among us
"3rd. Story: Don't worry. The stiffness wont laeast forever.

4th. Story: THIS WHY YOU DON'T CUT YOUR DOGS VOCAL CORDS. It's animal abuse and in situations like this. You gonna F*CKING DIE."
fake
they’re obviously SUPPOSED to be fake. that’s literally the point of 2 sentence horror
Rigor doesn't last forever.  But imagining being trapped for the 30+ hours it can is truly horrifying.
The 1. One is the impostor wanting to kill him but 2 more crewmates cam alonf them
"Reuben coxdoherty’s tormentors we’re only human after all.

But they weren’t for much longer after she found them"
rip the guy who got hard from rick and morty ☠️
What if the doctor just told the kid he had herpes and can’t date his girlfriend anymore? Doesn’t say it was a ghost.
"The last one is just Karma, don't you EVER hurt a dog on MY watch... or else..."
Ammumus
"I have one:
My son got a new game this weekend but something about it seems eerie…
I don’t know whether it’s how all the characters look like us and the house is the same, or how I keep hearing “double kill” this late at night.."
AMOG IS
Wait! *whatever the astronaut's name is* do I have any bad memories of you? *holds weapon to their head* do I have bad memories with you?!?!
Nice rick and morty refference
Rick and mortis...💀💀💀
I LITERALLY HATE ALL HUMANS WHO DEBARKED THEIR DOG THOSE OWNERS DESERVED IT😡😡😡
"dogs are revolting
i debarked the family dog and it's the best decision i made"
"if you hate dogs, THEN WHY TF DO YOU HAVE ONE? if people removed their children’s vocal cords, they would immediately be hated and arrested. Why should it be different for debarking/declawing? DEBARKING IS ABUSIVE."
the first one is quite sussy
😐
I guess in story one you can say. Theres a impostor among us :)
😐
There were only 2 is interesting because it gives the idea that the monster changed their memories
1st one is among us
First one should be a doctor who episode
The last one made me cry. How dare you?! 😭
"Rigor mortis only lasts for a certain amount of time, she would be fine, also his arms are just around her so she should be able to wiggle free either up or down, like I said though if not she can just wait a while, not gonna be fun but definitely survivable pretty easily"
That's what you get for debarking your dog
honestly...if you declaw or debark an animal I want to see you get what's coming to you
"After seeing the first one, all I though was ""amogus"".
I'm done, I need help..."
POOR CHARLIE 😢😢😢😢
Last one the people got what they deserved
"Debarking is the real horor here, that's blatantly animal abuse."
Horror has two r’s
The woman will be able to free herself after 6 hrs when the muscles start to degenerate
Explanation for the first one: it's the hit video game Among us
There are only two total
"Two others, other than him. Now there is an extra."
"Third one reminds me of a movie I saw one time, can't remember the name"
People that debark their dog has a special place in hell
"Rigor Mortis isn’t permanent, it goes away after around 36 hours. Plus i’m not even sure it would be fully set in after just going to bed, it happens over a 24hr period. The forensics student in me is bothered by that 😂"
"No, it goes away sooner for her. Rigor Mortis sets in after 8 hours, she's got another 4 to 6 before the joints loosen enough to wiggle out."
A- A- A- AMONGUS
Does anyone know the song used in the background?
Late Afternoon Drifting by The Caretaker!
Thanks!
Debarking is cruel. Don't do it. It's what the last one was about
"You know what happens when a body dies. If the starving won’t kill the wife, the smell will."
It's a few days before smell starts
the first one il literally amongus
"Oder: ihr habt beide einen mathematischen Fehler gemacht und es sind wirklich 37,6591 Euro"
"I mean, rigor mortis doesn’t last that long. The wife probably wouldn’t die. She just has to wait 24 hours (I think it’s 24 anyways. Might be 48, I forget which one. Been a while since I learned about this stuff)"
i wonder if it'd be strong enough to where someone genuinely couldn't get out
"​ @meowmeowmeow300  all humans except the most fragile are can out bench the worlds strongest, after a person dies due to the signal in the brain not working to correct over grip. Thankfully since she's already at the Riger mortis stage, he will relax in 4 to 6 hours after the muscles start to break down. I worry about her breaking a rib or her sternum."
"TIL about debarking procedure and.. wtf? If you want a pet which doesn't bark, keep a rock pet."
"Or a hermit crab. If you want them just do you can give it basic necessities and sue it to show off, just get a hermit crab."
"Or a hamster, they don’t bark either"
I literally just learned that there was such thing as “de-barking” a dog. Now hearing it in a horror story….
It's pure animal abuse is what it is.
Debarking dogs is a whole horror story of its own.
I never even know such a thing existed. It's cruel.
Had no idea that existed. They deserve what's comming to them because their dog couldn't warn them
"The thing is that It’s not „was”, This „procedure” is still done today. There are people who maim their animals for their convenience. Most of people who do that don’t even think how cruel it is. They just do it because they can. I’m happy that it’s criminal offence in my country."
Yeah
​ @RaccoonRecluse Fr
"De-clawing cats and de-barking dogs are the worst things you can do (medical wise, as zoophilia and killing is a whole different thing)"
"It's actually illegal in a lot of places which I'm glad for, but you can still get your dog debarked and I don't like that at all. It might as well be animal abuse"
"First we got cats getting their claws removed,birds getting their wings removed,and now we got de-barking your dog!? what is wrong with these people 😔"
I hate that debarking surgery… I hate it…
1000% agreed
"For the 3rd one; if she can hang out for a cool 36 hours, that rigor will end and you'll be able to escape. Hope you have nose plugs and a good therapist. Best of luck!"
"My dumb@$$ was about to ask ""why nose plugs?"" When I remembered ""oh yeah, decaying body, duh 🙄"""
The nose plugs is what I said!
"If she's really desperate, she could get someone to break the husband's arms."
Not even 36 hours...  its 8hrs after the body dies until rigor mortis sets in (who the fuck could sleep through a body getting cold??)  And the 12hrs into death the muscles would relax..the smell doesnt start until a few days.. but the biggest issue would be the muscles relaxing and defecation while in the bed 😂
She can wiggle out in as little as 4 hours.
"​ @v.crowley  rigor motis can last anywhere from 1-4 days, pretty sure on average so it could be longer but I'm not sure"
"Was looking for this bc I couldn't remember the timeframe, but yeah. Rigor isn't permanent, you just gotta last a little bit"
" @lotusleaf1365   ""lasts 1-4 days"" does not mean ""remains in its peak 1-4 days"". It's not like the muscles instantly become rock hard and stay that way until instantly becoming soft again."
" @DerpDevilDD  I never said it was, I just said it on average lasts 1-4 days :/"
" @lotusleaf1365  Yes, but you said it in response to someone saying the muscles would relax after 12 hours, which implies that the muscles don't relax at all for at least 24 hours."
" @DerpDevilDD  so you're saying I IMPLIED it doesn't relax at all for at least 24hrs?? My message ain'it that deep bud, all I said was it can last anywhere from 1-4 days. Never said how strong it lasts, never said that it couldn't/wouldn't end any sooner, in fact I even said it COULD last for longer than. Quit trying to find some hidden meaning in every message you see :/"
" @lotusleaf1365   It's not a ""hidden meaning"". Are you saying that you weren't contradicting the person who said it could end after 12 hours?"
" @DerpDevilDD  I'm saying you're treating it like it is. I never was contradicting said person, I never even said something was or wasn't. I simply just said it can last anywhere from 1-4 days, that's a statement, that's a FACT even, not a debate. Again, at no point did I say rigor motis is at it's peak for 1-4 days, just that it LASTS for 1-4 days. Again, you are trying to make it out like I said more then I did"
" @lotusleaf1365   Either you're pretending you don't understand how pointing out a fact that counters what someone has said is, in fact, you contradicting them or you genuinely don't understand that. Either way, there's no point it continuing with you about it."
I think she’d survive 😅
Isn't screaming for help a better option?
 @v.crowley actually assuming they aren’t on the weekends family or there jobs would check in on them
Most people sleep next to their phones so drag his ass to the phone and call someone with a hacksaw
Yep
"​ @v.crowley yes, and if she's in a position to do so she might even be able to work the rigor mortis out of his muscles to get out"
"One day an old man died and his wife was the one calling the 112. It was a heart attack. ""This is the second husband dying from heart attack but this time he didn't die like the other while we were having sex."" Damn"
"I really like the first one it’s what two sentence horror should be, it makes the reader have more questions while letting in doubt. Like did he kill one, or is one of them a monster."
True horror story: there was a family that had a doctor perform that “debarking” surgery on their autistic son because they thought he was too loud. Not only did they treat him like an animal but they subjected him to a common form of animal abuse.
Is there a name for this case? I'd like to learn more about this story
 @chris6098  I’m not sure but it was relatively recent
Wtf is wrong with that family? That poor kid no one person or animal deserves to be abused or mistreated.
Oh i heard that too... No idea what family but it was horrifying. There is a special place for people like that in hell
​ @lenax9798  Were they punished
"If people would actually look into these things, instead of just getting pissed at the sensationalism of it and not bothering to learn more, the world would be a better place.

The autistic teenager became fixated on his own screaming and started doing it all day, everyday. After three years of constant, 95+ decibel screaming, the family met with a surgeon who performed a reversible procedure to limit (not silence) the volume of the boy's screams - and only his screams. He can still speak and make other sounds perfectly normally. Now that his screams are quieter, the fixation has waned and he screams 90% less often than he used to.

They didn't ""debark"" him, they didn't cut out his vocal cords. They made his, their, and their other also autistic (and sound sensitive) son's lives better and, if the situation is resolved, they can undo the surgery."
" @DerpDevilDD  I know the whole story, it’s still cruel and inhumane. They had other options to make him quieter, loads of things exist to absorb sound. The procedure was unnecessary and a violation of autonomy."
" @DerpDevilDD  If drummers can soundproof their rooms so they can play without disturbing people, those parents could soundproof his bedroom. But no, their issue was they “couldn’t take him anywhere”."
" @meelsky   You're intentionally ignoring the reality of the situation and skewing things just so you can continue to be angry.

I also love that your brilliant solution is to lock the kid in a sound-proofed room alone with his screams for hours at a time and think that's not abuse. That's what you think is humane."
 @DerpDevilDD  Nowhere did I say they should lock him up wtf. He’s a person with bodily autonomy and should be treated as such.
 @meelsky   Then how do you expect them to keep him in a sound proofed room?
 @DerpDevilDD  I love that you accuse me of “skewing things” right before you straight up made things up about what I said. I love that you say I’m ignoring the reality of the situation when you’re ignoring the fact that autistic peoples bodily autonomy is being violated and that’s horrible.
" @DerpDevilDD  He’s a fucking 14 year old boy who’s also autistic, do you seriously think they’d have to force him in any way to stay in his room? That’s what teenagers do, especially autistic teens."
 @meelsky   Explain to me the point of the soundproofed room if not to keep the screaming teenager inside of it.
" @DerpDevilDD  Literally no one is saying he’s forced to be in there, it just makes it quieter when he screams in there. It’s his fucking bedroom, he’s going to be in there for large amounts of time anyway because it’s his bedroom

Absolutely no one suggested he should be locked up and the fact you jumped to that conclusion is absurd."
" @meelsky   How do you know how much time he spends in his bedroom? And how do you know he even has his own room? You don't; you're making it up to make your virtually useless solution viable. Unless he stays in the room, alone, for long stretches of time, it doesn't help at all, and even if he did, it only helps at home - which means he never gets to leave the house and at least one parent always has to be there with him. No family outings, no visiting friends or relatives, no outside the home enrichment. If they're lucky, when he needs to go to the doctor, they get to ask that the office staff call when it's his turn and then go sit in the car while he screams, because they can't stay in the waiting room."
" @DerpDevilDD  Holy fucking shit NONE of that justifies violating someone’s bodily autonomy, jfc what is wrong with you?"
 @DerpDevilDD still extremely inhumane????
" @gisellethejpeg9898   I disagree. I think letting the kid scream himself into actually destroying his vocal chords, while simultaneously torturing his also autistic brother, and trapping himself and at least one parent in the house 24/7 is inhumane. Doing a reversible surgery that did not inhibit him from speaking in any way to improve his quality of life (and that of his family) is a reasonable option. Literally, the only thing affected was his screaming. Which is why they were able to find a reputable doctor in the US who would do it."
 @meelsky So you are saying he should only be a normal person in his bedroom?
" @meelsky  well no they couldn't take anywhere. Not really, not with him screaming at the top of his lungs.. And yeah they could have sound proofed his room but then What? He'd have to spend all his time in his room? That's not fair to him either.. just saying"
 @nataliepiliro8377  My dude you have clearly never met an autistic person in your life.
"Everyone: the last one is Among Us!
Me: they cannibilized one of the astronauts and didn't want others to know"
"There was only two, now there is three.... can you math?"
Among Us
Saddest part about the last one is that the dog still loved them
I wanted to hear a scary story... but ended up with a big aaaawwww
"True, but let’s be honest, I’m hoping the only one that gets killed in that story is the one who D barks the dog, because if it’s a family, I’m assuming it was the parents or one of the parents and the kids had no choice. if I was a kid in that situation, I’d feel extremely guilty if I was the one telling the dog to bark."
Ok
​ Toxsein_ryler  maybe the dog had a medical problem
He'll go limp again in 36 hours just gotta focus on staying sane till then
From what I've read it's more like 3 hours
"Yeah, you can wiggle out sooner than then. I don't want to think of the fluid loss you are in the way of."
"​ @Walter-E-D  anywhere from 1-4 days on average, it could be more but I'm not sure"
Coupt ve sooner depending on temperature
The woman could escape from her husband you’ve just Gotta wait a couple days for the muscles to rot she should survive
4 they deserved it for doing that to the dog
"I literally said, ""Fucking deserved it."""
Yes they did
The explanation for the first one is AMOGNUS
First one- amogus
"Last one:
You can get surgery for your dog, where they can no longer bark. This allowed the dark figures to get past without notice."
"Why would you ever want to do that? Just get a dog that doesn't bark, that's really weird to do that to your pet"
​ @jgcoverkknot5701  because some people are just stupid and cruel.
Owners deserve it XD
" @dan_person  they do, 100%"
"this procedure makes them bite people instead because they can't bark to protect themselves, this procedure is only illegal in 4 states."
Wait? There's such a thing? That's disturbing and cruel
 @dan_person  Heck yeah they do 😁
They deserved kt
"It doesn't take away their ability to bark, but it makes the noise softer and huskier"
Can some one please explain the last one🙏
The owners of the dog had a surgery to make it stop barking (presumably because it was barking constantly and was annoying them) but when it could have actually served as an important warning the dog couldn’t bark because of it. Thus the creature was free to enter unnoticed giving not even the slightest chance to escape/defend from it as the owners were fast asleep.
"Basically, the dog lost its ability to bark, and therefore when the intruder broke in, it couldn't warn the humans about it."
Don't debark ur dog. They damage the vocal cords by scratching them up real bad. Basically it's not fixing the problem it's just the lazy way out (btw debarking is actually dangerous and EXTREMELY PAINFUL so if u love ur dog just be a decent person and train them instead of causing them a whole lot of pain for a bit of silence also it doesn't help the dog it just hurts them)
Ooooh thank you to everyone who helped me
They tortured the dog and now it can’t warn it’s owners of the monster
wheres the one guy who explains everything
Bro it's been 7 minutes
Idk but it ain't me
I'm here.
Above you

Hi Joel. I know you recently put up a video narrating Sam Riding's stories. Just curious and hopeful there will be more of those on the member channel? ❤ thank you for all your hard work. Appreciate you. Happy Holidays as well!! (Edit: I've already listened to almost all of the current member content that's why I was curious to ask about it.  Thanks again!)
I have a dog that is my best friend and companion. If I was in that old guy's shoes I wouldn't had been so nice to the guy responsible for killing my dog
"Story 3 is a shorter version of a series called I inherited a Mortuary from Horror on the Rocks channel, for those that are wondering. It’s a really good series."
Wait what’s story 3 supposed to be? Is it incomplete
Omg long video from Let's read! ❤️❤️
IL USA 🇺🇸 thank you 😊
I feel a couple of these stories have been read on this channel multiple times
Story 4 pissed me off.
Who else remembers the same 1st story on a different episode
"Me: “I’ll just listen to the first story.”
Also me at 3am: “Okay one more… and then I’ll definitely sleep.”"
This was SUPERB!!! Got me through work today... Best you tuber EVER !!!!!👏👏👏This man needs to win an award
Love the thumbnail ❤❤
The people from the Beetlejuice movie village are jerks?
I should’ve known with it being a long our conversation that it was repeat but I’m sure they will get a lot of snow but I will find another video
STORY 3 has me confused
Same
🧡💜🤎💚 Me Some Let's Read 💜🎊💜🎊💜
Thank you for the video and reading Joel. You and your team are fantastic. Listening at work. Have a good week.
5 story was repeated
You have some very devoted listeners. I've been reading through some of the comments...mind blowing!! All the people you help?? Dude it warms my heart. It's such a cold world but it really gives me hope for humanity reading your fans comments. What a beautiful show of gratitude!!
"Any story that involves a person or couple letting strangers into their home has me baffled. Those situations almost always involve either someone who is having a psychotic break fueled by mental illlness or dr*gs (sometimes both), or it's a ploy to rob someone. People are so gullible sometimes. Don't let random people in your house, especially in the dead of night. Call the cops and have them deal with it. The biggest indicator that someone has bad intentions is when they tell you to not call the police. If you offer to call the authorities and they object, bad news all around"
Thanks Joel :_LetsReadPixel::_LetsReadPizzaHeart::_LetsReadPixel::_LetsReadButtersock::_LetsReadSteamRoll::_LetsReadButtersock: Love ya' Work 🙏❤️😮 !!!
3 hours story is awesome to fall asleep
Yaya!!
Story 17...seems like the consequences of a victim exposed to ridicule and bullying...feel bad for him.
"It's 12:34am and 27⁰ (warm) with no breeze tonight, so hopefully the sound of rain and your voice can get me to fall asleep 🤞🏻 
Appreciate you Joel!!"
"I have a border collie australian shepherd mix with the MDR1 gene mutation. It essentially means many medications that are safe for dogs will kill her. We have to be very careful with her so she doesn't get exposed to something which is normally easily treatable, but isn't for her.  The knowledge of that terrible gene mutation for German Shepherds is heartbreaking. That whole story was heartbreaking on both sides. I know what it feels like to have a past you're not proud of - to change yourself and actively decide to become a better person only for that past to come back for you. But i also know what it's like to feel completely alone and one other life/being is keeping you going.  That story just hit hard."
"Dear Lord... that third story, the one about the demons and succubi etc, was such an obvious ChatGPT product. I couldn't get through it."
It’s actually from Horror on the Rocks channel. The story is called I inherited a mortuary.
❤❤❤
story 5 is an idiot if anybody is ever in that position break the window don't do what that braindead idiot did
Love let’s read and Mr ballen but I’ve seen everything and it sucks getting reposted stories either way I’m going to watch this whole video while I work😂
"Let's Read Family, I have been a subscriber for years and I believe one of your story's from this video is a shorten version of i inherited a mortuary, by horror on the rocks podcast. I also mention this because I love that Playlist."
