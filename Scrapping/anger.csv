"Del dude is pretty cool, shame he left aj."
You talk over your friends alot
Anyone back here from Concord and MindsEy3? Triple A still hasn't learned. (I know these games came out longer ago relatively but I'm always a few months behind.)
Shut up del.
"I honestly wanted to play and love anthem. But it was just so grindy and shallow and the mechanics were unintuitive. It was a great looking game and flying around was awesome. But the grind was not good and the loot drops were awful. The weapons not being awesome and different was so bad. Not having legendary weapons that had special effects or some kind of special function was a major failure.
All they had to do was look at Destiny…. What do you think of when it comes to that game if you played it….? Gjallarhorn, fatebringer, ace of spaces, whisper of the worm.
Like come on… you had plenty of examples of looter shooters to pull from. 
But today we know why anthem failed…. Lack of direction and vision, and lack of a cohesive team."
"@23:00
They're going to take all the talented  people for Dragon Age 4!


Meanwhile- in 2024 💀"
I was just about to comment the same exact thing. My faith in bioware as a company is nonexistent. They really need to hit it out of the park with ME5 or they will be shut down.
48:35 I love this part XD
When the fat ass tries to 100% anthem.. you know his life is a waste 😂😂
That's rich coming from someone that makes mobile game content...
 @Terribadguy.  LMAO
Isn’t it bros job tho lmao
"Anybody else here, rewatching these old reviews like they're podcasts episodes while they do stuff?"
"Yes, doing the same thing lol"
55:27 this is more relevant than ever with theses devs bitching about BG3.
"What's funny is 4 years after the making of this video, Warframe, in my opinion still the best looter shooter you'll never need to buy, has the very same material, armor textures and fabrics customization, in the form of Voidshell Skins, as mentioned and shown around 15:00. Having realized that,it again only reminds me how much Anthem really fell short of everyone's expectations. This game honestly should have converted over Warframe's playerbase the same way games like Genshin Impact and Destiny did."
"I want Starfield to set a new standard.
We need something greater this decade in this supposed """"""next gen"""""""
@DunWorryBoutitBoutit I didn't buy it after knowing what it was
@DunWorryBoutitBoutit This is previous to launch day
And then Redfall dropped 😌😹😹
Damn you capitalism 🤒
Being mangled and tangled is Anthem's bread and butter
"Man does this criticism of the game AND the defenders really demonstrates how every single opportunity to give a company the ""benefit of the doubt"" is a choice that is NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST. Imagine being someone that defends roadmaps in 2023...."
It's astonishing
"My problem with anthem was the opposite of his. It was ""elemental combos"" did billions if damage. 
Its just only certain weapon and ability ""combos"" would proc it and some weapons could proc it. 
I literally killed the spider boss before it hit the ground before I stopped playing the game."
"EA's app has even been screwing over gamers by denying access in offline mode or booting people from games for no reason. Overall, I'm reluctant to spend any more money with EA until they fix their app."
4 years later and nothing was ever done.
"WARFRAME IS NOT A LOOTER SHOOTER 💀💀💀 ITS AN MMO, but yes I agree bdl 2 is the BEST looter shooter"
"We need to stay more informed on WHO, if any, original team members remain, before flocking to the new DiCE, Bungie or Bioware title.

Empire Strikes Back wouldn't have been the same if it weren't for the expertise and knowledge at the film's disposal.

Corporations continue to prop up studios they KNOW to be lacking, still holding the logo aloft like a gold standard - this is the phantom video game crash, that they take strides in occluding, camouflaged with bells and whistles."
"The days of a human being getting in touch with the audience and taking responsibility for a lacklustre game......long gone.

Gaming has been 'corporatized'. So it's throw the Studio under the bus and stand there, unmoving, uncaring corporate like a wall of legal Kevlar that in no way holds anyone responsible for the shitty games farted out the door in too short a timeframe and on too little funds.

That's what we get for our loyalty and the pots and pots of gold they get to haul away so the investors can feast."
This is not true to be honest
Everyone hated on destiny and rightly so but damn was that game fun compared to all the other shit that tried to copy it😂
"In all honesty Destiny 2 is VASTLY BETTER, now that its had more seasons and dlc. Also, more ability additions and reworking, plus lightfall around the corner. Destiny 2  leaves Anthem in the dust. However, no looter shooter will ever be as awesome as Borderlands 2"
"Every time I get temptation to buy this when it goes on sale for less than 8 pounds, I turn to this video to come to my senses"
You're crazy if you put more than 100 hours in destiny
I love destiny but I never thought it would have the moral high ground with what makes a good looter live service shooter lol
I miss del </3
thinking back about ability scalling if they just make skill damage scale with weapon like other game it will be ok. what ever there is a reason why people called EA is the worse game company.
They still haven't fixed it hahahaha
wow when joe said it was like a skeleton crew made it he manage to predict what actually happened before this information was discovered
@AngryJoeShow I would love to see a video game made by you and your team :-)
Found the anthem fan💀
 @SquilliusSigmaximus  Why would you say that?
 @SquilliusSigmaximus are you slow?
"Anthem just makes me laugh these days, cos this ain't got nothing on Elden ring! 🤣"
Coming back 3 years later lmaooo anthem was such a fucking shitty game & i loved this review when it first came out
"I think for the $10 I paid for this game it has some goodness. Do not come to this game looking for a good story/dialog or characters with Yarrow being the exception. Also be prepared as with Destiny to be forced to do certain lower power content with others versus a private mission. I do like that there is matchmaking available for the higher level content as I think I will need the help, unlike Destiny which has no matchmaking for the higher content that you need the help in. So far though as a level 25 without even switching classes, having fun with anthem and I feel like you can solo most of the hard content haven't unlocked grandmaster difficulty yet but looking forward to it.
I don't notice the load time to be nearly as much of a problem as it probably was at launch.
I'd say give this game a try. A third person looter shooter with flying in an open world. Worth at least $20 imo."
Gimme the loot
"This game is when I knew BioWare was dead. Yes EA is a small part to blame because they required the Frostbite engine to be used. But 7 years of development and THIS is what we get, yeah I was done with BioWare after this."
I remember a friend of mine being so hyped for this and bought/pre ordered the 80$ version of this. Man I feel so bad for him. This game ain’t even worth 10$
Gamestop as of today is charging a single cent for the game lmao
It’s time to get some new friends
"Thank GOD DESTINY upped their game and got a shit ton better. It’s SO much better now, then it was when it first came out. Anthem should take some cues from the that."
"@11:40 Watching this now, I feel the Cyberpunk Shudder 🤢"
"This was the game that made me stop pre-ordering games, period. I seriously woke up after this. And before the launch of this game, I was hyping it up to all my friends and co workers. Never again."
48:36 I love this part XD
🙄 Thinking of the last 5yrs of EA published games.... I just dont want to buy EA anymore.
Then come Dead Space Remake
"That was a good one, I admit. 😆 Fun game and good fan-service to the original. Motive is proving the quality of their studio so far. I hope they can continue. Star Wars: Squadrons was great too as their first full project. -- Dead Space 2 is rumored due to the survey floating around this year and their Ironman game is likely next. 

I hope EA can learn to not rush their studios and have them push something that isn't ready. I'd be nice."
"In case anyone was wondering, the game is still full price. Showing $80 on EA's site."
Is it worth trying now?
"Considering the game was outright abandoned by EA and Bioware, no, it's not."
 @dragonbornexpress5650  aren’t there private fan servers now?
"@Trenaur the original servers still online, If you find the game for 8$ or 5$ give It a try"
 @elangryador832  thanks I’ve been playing last couple of weeks and it’s great!
 @dragonbornexpress5650 still playing it free to play and it’s great!  Loads of fixes and updates.
 @elangryador832 still playing and loving it!
What ever happened to that guy with the beard?
"Once you get an archwing in warframe, it’s like you have unlocked another whole aspect of yourself you can utilize in many ways."
Borderlands has always imo been best looter shooters and tiny tinas is gearing up to be incredible!
You know its going to be great all of the Borderlands games are great.
 @Robert1211995  this didn’t age well lol Tiny Tina is an annoying unplayable game
"After seeing your video again in 2022, i gave the game a new try today.
I started a new game, reached the town, and while getting to the first shop i saw the game lost connection and closed.
You can‘t make this up!

And the funny thing, while writing this comment, even youtube crashed. ;-)"
fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk Anthem was 3 years ago???
"Delrith was probably one of the only ppl on AJS to be committed to thoroughly get every master work. And play a bad game like this to really explain the grind. He was the only really good video game player they had. Rapid reviews may not have been for him, but his analysis of the game was really good. I think they should've taken him off rapid reviews. I think if he returned it could only benefit the AJS."
"Alex beat elden ring seven times, but that's because he was having fun."
They should do a return to this for a postmortem.
These videos are literally unwatchable with that troll guy
And the game is dead :/ such wasted potential its a shame
I revisited this discussion because it's relevant after BF 2042. How much does someone want to bet 2042 gets abandoned also?
This video is like a time capsule of Athems complete failure.
Is it even worth the $5 it’s on sale for on origin now? Doesn’t seem like it lol
"That's like Cyberpunk 2077 creators promised a lot of things in game, but when game releases this promised things you can't found, nowhere."
These anthem videos aged the best! The defenders of anthem should never show themselves again lol. Rip anthem was rooting for you.
"The content, much like my ex wife, never came......."
All that hype and it failed to live up to it. That is the current story of the gaming industry. All show and no go.
anthem has failed me 🤒i have been lied 🤮
they’re gonna fix it.   Well looks like they aren’t
This video is now part of gaming history.
Tomb mission was padding to slow down the game completion it was the worst idea in history
The original idea for anthem was much bigger world and stuff but they were told to turn it to a gaas
Looking back on this it’s crazy because they butchered the game
"""Are they going to fix this? yes...""
...About that."
"This review aged VERY, very well. :D"
Looking back now at his optimism they would fix this game just makes me sad that they never did.
"Yes Prospero is Corporate Commander in the upcoming new feature Angry Joe: Corporate Wars Where Angry Joe and Corporate Commander go head to head in a final battle. Here AJ will finally put an end to Corporate’s Agenda and after the battle ensues, Joe and the AJSA saves the world of gaming. Lol"
EA is lucky to have their surprise mechanics because anything else is poopoo and they know it.
"@28:40, he says give them 2 more years and it will be great. Fast forward 2 years and the game is canceled... :("
"he meant in development, RDR2 is a GOTY and they devvd that for like a decade"
They never fixed it lmao.
"Just two years after its debut, though, publisher Electronic Arts has announced that it is formally pulling the plug on Anthem. ... Anthem's ambitious “10-year-plan” had been killed off just two years after it had begun."
"They didn't fix anything and killed the game not long after launch. What an absolute fucking disaster. 7 Years in the making. The ""Bob Dillon"" of games... fucking lol."
I hope Other Joe's arm hole has healed.
Bungie got the rights to destiny and just do season passes/battle passes like every other fuckibg game atm. Unlock this then unlock this. Grind this game mode/mission over and over and get more loot.
I miss Delrith in newer reviews. Where has he gone?
I rememner joe saying in a video that he just wanted to branch off and do his own thing. I believe he streams and makes content just on his own
"Damn, miss Del"
"if in game my choices would effect the story, then i would make choices that end up destroying fort tarsis cause of how bad ea made it"
"""Are they going to fix this? Yes, eventually.""

A quote that aged about as well as me & my dad's ""science experiment"" involving a jug of milk being left outside for a week."
What happened to Del?
"he is either on a massive diet - at a exercise camp - or what happens to most super size people , there body's give out"
 @creatorsfreedom6734  Uncool bro seriously 😑
 @PoorLittleCrow  u cant handle the truth ?
Just came across this video
"I do not miss buying EA games. Its just so easy not too. Do you want to unclog this back up toilet with your bare hands ""no I am good"" its that simple"
"Lol, Saints Row 4 did a good job of spawning enemies right in front of you"
Man Anthem was so amazing cant believe how it turned out.
"Played it recently cuz of EA play, man what a missed opportunity. So much potential gone to shit."
"Lol I don't think this game ever got any update, let alone anthem next... It's on sale for $3.99 psn and I'm still like nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
"I genuinely bought the 80 dollar legion of dawn edition of this game. I played it until the end, and said, ""what?"" A waste of 80 dollars!"
It took me 1123 hours to burn out on skyrim. Took me about 10 minutes for fallout 76
The roadmap: “so that was a lie” 😂
Rehearing the crap dialogue is really making me worried about Mass Effect 4 whenever that comes out..
"Joe: are they gonna fix it? Yes

EA: excuse me?"
it’s like buying a gym membership while it’s just a treadmill in a room.
and in lockdown for a year without access to the treadmill
 @Kulina-AV8  and then find out there’s no treadmill at all smh
Anthem: Wasted potential
Video still relevant in 2021
Hahaha it’s 2021 and they gave up on anthem hahahaa one hell of a roadmap lol
Revisiting this two years later: they didn't fix anything and abandoned the game in this state. Worst game in history.
No. They ripped the lead dev for… I can’t remember which game
"That's EA's live service in action, don't forget to buy their latest disaster bf2042 only $70!"
Can't believe people are still commenting on this old video.
 @markdexter6338  I sometimes watch Joe's old reviews like podcasts while I do other shit. It's great hearing him shit on bad games while I work
" @goofball1_134  a lot of times he predicted the future, hindsight is 20 20"
"Well, probably not the worst game ever, but for its budget and hype? Yeah, perhaps."
 @trygveplaustrum4634  At the time yeah it was the worst game ever because this game was before the disasters that were Battlefield 2042 and Cyberpunk 2077!
 @cursedhawkins1305  at least CDPR “fixed”(depending on your definition ig) cyberpunk and they’re coming out with free dlc I’m pretty sure
 @cursedhawkins1305  battlefield had me PISSED as a fan of the series tho fr and I haven’t touched it since the early access. How the might have fallen😭
 @cursedhawkins1305  you forgot avengers...
get it for a penny at gamestop lol
I've seen a lot worse
 @markdexter6338  hey bud ❤
"My favorite juxtaposition for this game is Destiny. Destiny had a similar shitty start, both for it's original and sequel title, yet look how the game has grown. The Witch Queen was great, provided lots of content and a challenging Legendary campaign mode that rewarded the player for their effort.

Destiny still has plenty of issues but I love the game for the massive growth it's story has gotten, and the consistently fun gameplay. And the LOOT!!!! Actual loot!

Anthem could have had all of the same accolades if anybody at Bioware had given a quarter of a fuck about what they were doing when they were working on it."
"4 years later here, my comment is somewhere up there haha"
"I bought Anthem on sale for like 85% off. Got the Legion of the Dawn edition for $11. Story still sucked and progression of said story and mission structure sucked balls, but was it worth the $11 at the time of purchase? Sure. I got a good amount of enjoyment out of the game that far exceeded my $11 purchase. Was it worth the undiscounted $60 (without the UlTiMaTe EdItIoN nonsense)? Absolutely not. I was kinda looking forward to Anthem 2.0 but then EA decided to axe that and aren't adding any more content, but it looks like the servers are still up and won't be shutting down any time soon."
" @KGHMArchives  they should have released the code to the community and let the fans fix it, write cool lore and expansions. The drank was almost there..."
"4 years later, still waiting for my refund. Or a finished game. Ya gotta do one or the other. Lol. I can't believe they charged full price + premium legendary edition for an extended tech demo."
This video aged well
I was about a year late to Anthem but I gave it a chance.. Was hooked on it for about 2 months as I loved the mechanics but then got kinda bored or grinding over and over.
"It's sad watching this now and hearing Joe say ""will they fix this, yes here is the road map"". It would be nothing but lie after lie until they admitted that they didn't care enough to do right by the customer and killed the game."
"Yep, never buying another BioWare product after what happened

Edit: Coming from a huge Mass Effect fan."
 @PeteNico93  I think most of the people who were most responsible for “Anthem’s” shortcomings have left by now.
 @redjed100  The problem is everyone who made Bioware great are also gone..
" @PeteNico93  That is, unfortunately, true. BioWare won’t ever be the developer it was. But I hope that their work on the “Mass Effect” remaster bundle is a sign that they can be at least a good developer again."
"Rewatching the review... they still havent fixed the game. In fact, they just gave it up all together LOL"
"2 months after you posted this video  
ANTHEM still has not hit 6 million solid  ...
  Now in 2021 with covid19  ..
Not a single friend plays ANTHEM .."
They fixed it the only way EA could by cancelling the whole damned thing.
1:17 this didn't age well
This aged well :D
Anthem 2 😂 that's a laugh
Annnd the update is never coming. Anthem Next is cancelled. I wonder how long the servers will remain switched on.
Mo ok
"I dont why this video autoplayed but its 
2021, and Anthem is cancelled and there will be no further updates"
Here I am two years later. EA officially killed the game.
Thoughts on Anthem being canceled? 🤣
Anthem Next literally just got canceled yesterday
Back in 2021....for the comments lol
This is the type of shit that is most disappointing. This game could have been special but it seems like whenever there was a decision to make they made the worst one. Too much potential
Well its February 9th 2021 and they still haven't done anything
"and won't ever, from the latest reports."
"Yeah they never fixed this poor excuse of a game, to be fair joe nailed it."
"This is a common practice in my office as well. Our project manager asked us to design ""pieces"" of a school that would be visible in renderings to market to the client to get them to invest, but they would eventually use a completely different designer and the district would ALWAYS get a downgrade of what was marketed."
That should be illegal
FYI the roadmap never happened
"Looking back on this vid after the CDPR 2077 debacle, Joe really took it easy on CDPR. Just goes to show how much he believed in them like the rest of us to deliver a product that we were sold on from get go. We have no one to blame but ourselves for letting these companies not hold up their end of the bargain or keep their promises even after selling us broken unfinished games. We are the funding for these games period."
As a game CP 2077 is still much better than this crap.
"Cyberpunk was not a bad game at all. It had a great story and some side quests were very good.{and i had NP performance wise although i know many did and in my opinion they got greedy trying to make this game work on 8yr old consoles} The only problem i had with CP was the amount of content taken out. I put over 120 hrs in it and i could tell it was missing 
a lot of content. At least they will try and fix it for others and add content. We already know that Anthem is done with and they did nothing for that game after release!"
Mexicano vibe? :)
"""the typical consumer gamer is a very stupid person and will buy anything, even a stick with 4k resolution. the cheap bastard  on the other hand will wait for the review and see if it survives the hype, and then buy the game.""
                                                                                                                                                                                           -George Orwell, 1948."
"""Are they going to fix this? Yes....eventually""

2 Y E A R S L A T E R"
Coming back to this wish BioWare was hit hard the way cdpr did with cyberpunk n i don’t mean backlash cause Ik it got that but I mean to the point where it gets taken to court for lyin n guaranteed refunds at the time
Fr these game companies need to be put in their place.
 @Grim_Concept  factsss g 👌🏽
Del is awesome!
I like coming back to these to hear about Anthem all over again 😎
"Anyone else watching this in 2021 and wondering if that ""overhaul"" was just BS to avoid a lawsuit? Like, seriously, where is it? I have no horse in this race because I never buy games at release anymore for EXACTLY this reason; I'm glad I don't fall for hype anymore since it keeps way more money in my bank account."
They made a mistake forcing ps plus for a game and online only making it impossible to play when internet goes off. And with no plus you can not play. There is a lot of errors when loading after 5 to 10 min of loading. Game play is fun when able to play but it's like a forcing pay to play game
Brooooo me and joe had the same idea border lands 2 was soo fucking for putting many hours in with friends to get crazyyyyyy asssss loooooot
Borderlands still does the loot the best which is crazy knowing many other Gearbox projects just straight up flop.
"so, how's this game doing now?"
A year later and still no news  on this trash game
"There it is. 

: for every fucking bullshit fucking game..

The second you learn about the hidden broken lieing bullshit. The hidden pyramid ponzi scheme that directly leads to money grabing multiplayer online only garbage so your brainwashed ass never leaves the casino.. when there is absolutely zero chance and no pause button at all..

Its not a fucking video game.

Do not play warframe or anything that even trys to be like it.

Do not play destiny the division. Monster Hunter world. Anthem. Fortnight. All of this multiplayer pay to cheat garbage and ever service is just a giant server slot machine with evil assholes manipulating everything that you do. Makeing gamers into guinea pigs and lab rats! - the nicotine water bottle commercial! XD

Just burn the bullshit into the ground becuse its two years latter and i told you so! XD"
Looking back on this...Anthem was only the start
Far from last too because people don't learn. Lol
"There are two major things that made me drop Anthem initially and those were the enemies and the story. 

The combat and exploration (while it certainly could be better) was fun and the game looked gorgeous at times.
Though I share AJ's concern and beef with it on pretty much all points.

The enemies are completely forgettable and don't feel like they differ from eachother much which is a huge problem when you spend so much time fighting them.
Mass Effect (the trilogy) worked so damn well because the enemies were interesting and felt distinct. 
Most importanly, they felt like they belonged in that world and had some motivation of their own with a fleshed out origin and history that developed throughout the game as you learned more about them and became more motivated to fight them.

As for the story, well... We all know what a crap sandwich that was. It simply isn't finished, it feels disjointed, makes little sense and... 
It's Destiny all over again; a solid base that was never developed properly. Just an exercise in wasted potential."
"Spoilers, they didn't fix it."
This is so sad  😞  EA.
You know what I love is you never actually play any of these games you make reviews on othewise you would know those items are in the game and in order to get these items you have to unlock them by doing quests and events and shit lmao 1 year later and your lies are still going around on youtube
Oh fuck off lmao
Bro this video is 1year old! This is a few weeks after launch. The game sucked back then and still does
"just google to see how many players this game has....2500 or so on xbox, and thats apperantly really bad."
Destiny gets millions daily
" @themaniacgaming7343  really? I didnt find destiny 2 that good, might have to try it again in that case."
"fck free to play live service. Stop supporting it people. Borderlands is better than ANY of these games, why bother with any of them? you might aswell just play Borderlands. Hopefully CyberPunk is the nail in the coffin and devs will start thinking twice about lying to customers."
Nothing happened yet
Don't worry CDPR will show these big time developers how to make a complete masterpiece of a game...... Or NOT
This did not age well. 😂
"Cdpr made like one amazing game ever, people overate them too much"
" @CreatureFeatureGaming  Since 2016, I can’t tell you how toxic CDPR fans were until cyberglitch 2077 came out and humble them. 😬 😆"
"I'm here from the Future

Prepare yourselves for what I've warned you about, Cyberpunk, Fallout 76, Last of Us 2, you have NO IDEA what's coming.

We tried to warn you not to allow certain things. Now..... now!?  You said they were ok. YOU SAID THAT.  YOU SAID IT WOULD GET BETTER AND REFUSED TO LISTEN TO TRUE REVIEWS

Anthem.....? .....that's.....just the beginning"
A year later and Anthem players are still waiting for the remake or update.
No new update since February 2020 lol
 @l3joint  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hell yeah dude!
How about that road map😂😂😂
Awesome review thank you guys!
Yikes lol almost 2 years later....
Come back a year later to see where we are....yeah the division 2 was a sleeper game considering...Anthem on the other hand needs to be put to sleep 🙏🏽✌🏽👊🏽
Anthems gameplay shits  on division  hard wish it had content and.things to do and chase raids
" @darthdater883  it really doesn't but hey thats your opinion, I still stand by my statement.🙏🏽✌🏽👊🏽"
You know your games going down the shitter when fallout 76 had more content than anthem😂
"The first cataclysm event was out on launch. 

In fact, the first cataclysm event WAS launch."
"Think I am going to start a phone company, and sell phones with stripped features.

You: ""Hey my phone can't make calls?!""

Me: ""Ahhh yeah, that will be in a future update. Maybe next month...""

I mean it is clearly ok with gamers so why not phone users, ""the content is coming"" right?"
I wonder how this game will look on next gen. And wonder if they will even put in the work to enhance it.
I really wanted this game to succeed but I guess  asking for a really good Epic hardcore games is to hard to ask for these days.
It's sad that Sonic Adventure in 1998 had moving NPCs that had their own storylines that progressed as you do.
EA and Ubisoft put out so many half assed money grubbing games.
"At least Ubisoft has SOME competence. Granted, it's not really that much, but they do try."
All these problems still exist btw
They going to fix it...hahahah
still so bad.
16:20 delrith speaking without his mouth moving lol
"Coming back about a year after this whole mess is great. Joe at this point still thinks this game was in six years hard development, but in reality it was in development for a little over a year, the other 6 was spent farting around."
This was back before Jason Schreier's article came out. Check out the next video after this one and Joe starts seething with rage.
" @dragonbornexpress5650  I know, I've watched that video a few times. It's just funny to look back at it"
"The best part of Anthem I enjoyed was never getting I----- Loading○
.................................................................
It."
Still can't believe I tried to hype this game to my pals (before it came out obviously) and played it for longer than a week 😂
ugh dell
one year later Game starts to get rehauled for anthem 2.0 lol fucking fail
"A lot of issues like these get reported by QA. QA can report hundreds of bugs and annoyances and provide detail and info. It's up to the developers to fix them. The developers were probably so overwhelmed with issues and a bad deadline that they just dealt with as many high priority ones as they could and waived dozens that weren't ""game-breaking""."
they should have added a quest of sweeping the floors. :D
"Yeah anthem was horrible. My game actually glitched to the point where I couldn't proceed any further. Meaning, during the mission where u gotta go to the tombs and hold square/x  on the tomb to collect whatever that shit is. Well I could do all but one then on the last one it wouldnt let me push any buttons. Nothing would happen. I was a sucker who pre-ordered it. Anthem ruined pre-orders for me. Haven't done it since"
"Good, No pre-orders."
BLUE?!!! FUCKING BLUE?!!!! Lol classic
Could you imagine if CDPR was apart of anthem and implemented their RPG style and elements
I thought the elemental weapons were particular masterworks. I have a lightning rifle for example
Anthem should have waited to release on the PS5. That would have given BioWare more time to work on the project and make Anthem a way better game. I think they released the game too early and that’s why it didn’t do so well. I remember watching the trailers and saying “I want this game.” Because the game sold itself and that’s what’s so disappointing. BioWare didn’t have to advertise the game much. We as gamers seen a game where we could fly around and be like Ironman and have cool powers. It is really sad that the game turned out the way it did
If you can dislike this video and defend this game you're an EA fanboy and can't handle any criticism and that's a fact.
Tfw warframe did it but for free
Del looks like he has gas quite frequently
"This game was Biowares second best selling game ever, it made over $100 million dollars. I think it is ridiculous they can make money with this shit!"
mxr plays
13:28 UH OH ANGRY JOE WATCHES THE QUARTERING...
"If by choices the developers mean the dialogues you can have in Fort Tarsis, yeah, sure, there are a few but it's not an excuse to lie to us. but this game doesn't even work as a cashgrab, because I'm pretty sure people just asked for refunds. I only use it to fly around now. I'm not even mentioning the bugs, you have a bug that you get stuck in the forge, and you can't get out. And sometimes the Forge takes like 2 minutes to load in the launch bay. Another bug is when you're taking damage from something you can't see. I was doing the Heart of Rage, and I was defeating the Tytan, my friends started fighting it, but I wasn't even in the are of Combat and I kept taking damage from nothing. Eventually I died from breathing oxygen I guess."
Delrith  > > > > > > > > > > > > > > Alex
Del is definitely a virgin
"Bioware: Oh, yeah. The roadmap, the map which indicates the road the game will follow; the road being the fixes and fresh content added.
Also Bioware: In terms of content, we have no content."
This video and the Anthem EXPOSED video are two of my favorite AngryJoe videos. I actually go back to these more than some Angry Reviews XD
And here i am. I bought the game early this year. I played for 30 to 40 minutes for a quick test and I'm waiting for them to release Anthem 2.0. If it exists that is.
Man... that beard is so thin... Pls just shave it man
"Man Joe really knows his shit,he called it."
"I get that it’s not for everyone but I think Destiny 2 is a genuinely great game. The shooting mechanics are top tier, the loot looks really cool IMO and the story is pretty cool (could be way more fleshed out tho)."
That gun Jurra's wrath at least now it exists. I do have it.
That really isn't something to praise.
 @dragonbornexpress5650  never said it was did I.
4X the dev time! 16X the reskins! and all new loading screen technology!
Looks like the shotguns reused ME animations as well
1h joe u just starv that fat ass with u over there !!!
I Chased For A Fire Pistol That Had Fire Damage In My First 4 Hours And When I Finnally Got It In Borderlands 2 I Loved Using It I Loved BorderLands 2
5:16
EA is worse than internet gas
engagement
They haven’t fixed it yet !! Lol....
My one compliment on Anthem is that the designs for the exo-suits are pretty badass. I'd love to see them in a good game or even a movie.
"I have more laughs with this review than any movie out there. Which is kind of sad... but for 15 dollars to know what you are talking about... worth it.


Anthem today: ,,Roadwhat?´´"
I just hated the tank has no shields wtf why
y'all should go back and play the thousands of games from the 90s. gameplay > graphics
"Joe: I wanna stay away from percentages, Del
immediately mentions 70% disconnects"
"Apex Legends has completely revelutionized gaming



I feel the same way when it comes to FPS. It just...""works"" for me so well to where it hard to adapt to other FPS that feel much slower imo"
Destinys gun play feels way better  no shooter comes close to how good it feels to shoot a gun in destiny the only thing they did that was nice is the ping option that's it
 @darthdater883  I do love destiny’s gun play. But the overall everything else in the game kinda kills it..that includes destiny 2 as well.
 @DammnDeejay  what you mean by  everything else  kills it I think the raids are awesome  pvp is dope there's stuff to do and chase  nightfalls are better then they ever been  I feel like destiny offers more then apex legends I can play pve or pvp  but i do like what apex legends did with the pinging option that is super awesome
" @darthdater883  the story mode is boring, forced walking segment that pads the game out unnecessarily, too many questions left unanswered in game, like how did we die in the first place to even be resurrected in the first game, we only HEAR about this cool event or war but never participate in it. Zavala and Ikora are DRY as Gatdamn toast, Cayde-6 is the only saving grace when it comes to characters. The protagonist is SILENT for some dumb reason when they should FULL well have a say so in at least SOMETHING, what IS the traveler and where did it come from, the loot is trash for a looter shooter, duplicate loot items, TRASH customization for Destiny 2 since they didn’t even alter it AT ALL,  samey world events,  etc

Should I really keep going"
 @darthdater883  and don’t forget those ridiculous micro transactions 🙄🙄
 @DammnDeejay  the story in destiny 1 and 2 were garbage I agree characters almost non existent cause 6 was cool tho but nobody at this point plays it for story we play for pvp raids and the loot chase whitch I disagree with you is not trash are you kidding me there's tons of amazing weapons in destiny  and is undeniable that destiny is in a great position right now it's a  great  game offers more then apex legends in my opinion
 @DammnDeejay  there's no microtransactions in destiny anymore  nothing is pay to win you can buy what you want directly it's only cosmetic stuff  you easily earn everything like I have I never ones payed for anything I earned everything by playing the game  I can tell you never played destiny after the  dlc's that made the game amazing taken king and forsaken I doubt you played   all the new expansions after forsaken when did you last play Destiny 2 back in 2017 when it was shit it's a totally different game now what are talking about
" @darthdater883  i stopped playing destiny in general bc there were just better FPS shooters with better loot imo. If I really want pvp that bad, there are tons of multiplayer games that provide a more stimulating experience. It’s very glossy but hollow imo. If you love playing it, then that’s awesome. There’s just not enough content in the game to keep me interested all that much for long periods of time. It’s good in short bursts for me."
 @DammnDeejay  hoooooow is there not enough content yeah back in 2017 their wasn't enough content and by the way destiny offers pvp and pve.... but now   you can easily put over 600 hours into destiny trials of osiris  whitch shooting game feels better then destiny it's the best in the business when it comes  shooting   it's the best looter shooter out easily in my opinion whitch looter shooter is better then destiny please I'll wait ?
Soon the answers were revealed.
"You guys should review this game again!!  It’s suuuuch a fun game now! I played from the beginning, ended up taking months off after the cataclysm (which was awesome) and came back recently...it’s amazing!"
"Yeah, no. The game is still plagued with the exact same issues since it launched from what I've heard."
over 10 years and your still as genuine and hardcore and real as ever. AND HILARIOUS. ANGRY JOE WILL NEVER SELL OUT!!
if you want a good looter shooter literally go play any of the 4 borderlands games the only series to get close to perfect
Not Borderlands 3. Story in that one is an utter fuckfest.
"1) Warframe is not a looter shooter
2) he keeps saying how much he loves Warframe yet we all know he never plays it
3) we all know he's going to give it a 6/10 if he ever reviews it"
Almost a year later since the release date.   The game is still the same.     I’m so glad I got the game for free when I bought my RTX graphics card.
Sad stuff my last name is the same as the lead producer
"Killian Irving Douchebag?? 
Sorry but cmon ya left yourself open for it"
"It's 2020, is this game out of early access yet? That's what the EA stands for right?"
January 28th 2020. Nothing given that was promised. Never trust a product with EA's name on it.
how does everyone think warframe is so good it I literally the definition of pay2win
These extended discussions are still my favorite videos.
Still not fixed
As far as I know the game is way better now but I think the damage is already done to me
Wrong.
 @BJWeNeedUDefendingUsWithZeMG42  lmao wich part of it
Destiny 3 should rip off the flying mechanic from anthem fuck the sparrows
Other joe is hot though🤣😜💖😁😍
"Joe..dawg..
let your friends talk as well lol"
I bought this for 10 bucks and it hurt
YEAH Anthem needed to have the Star wars the old republic MMO  multiplayer choice scene during story
48:12 😂
"""I'm going to pull up the roadmap""
pepelaugh he lacks the critical information"
Del doing 70 hours of Tyrant Mine is the definition of insanity.
I love that you guys deep dive the game instead of regurgitating what you read on reddit.
It’s bluuuuueeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!
"Why isn’t there an actual review of Warframe on here?  I can understand if you’re waiting for the next major update, but I’d like to know."
The trailer smelled like The Division. Same bad acting about getting loot.
I just skimmed through the whole video a few minutes at a time And joe was the only one talking. Please let the others speak and stop hogging the conversation.
Anthem is good but I only have one complaint the entire game
"I'm laughing so hard at Joe's reaction to the repeat line
Hahahaha"
Hahahaha
Soooo happy that I didn't get this game thanks angry Joe
The cow noise at 5:20 had me rolling.
Prospero 39:15
"And now here we are, not even a year after release.  The road map has been cancelled, the dev team has gone silent, and the future for Anthem is looking very bleak.  More than anything else, Anthem should stand as a reminder of the importance of going in with a plan.
Bioware mucked about with nebulous ideas for five years before scrambling to launch a half-baked product.  Imagine if they had a competent project director, had proper production managers and department heads, and had spent six years in actual development.  Anthem could have been a goddamned masterpiece."
"Bioware is dead mate it's not a fluke it all started to go downhill after Mass Effect 3 (They even did a lot to give people more as an ending)
Seriously after that.................."
Joe your making some good money now and maybe you should invest in hiring an investigator gamer to unlock the secret of passed old game failures. Kinda like a Game Cold Case like CSI :)
Does this game have no PvP?
No it's all PvE
"AJ: ""Now, are they going to fix this? Yes, eventually. Let's pull up the roadmap that they have for future content...""
Me in late 2019: ""This did not age well..."""
As a fellow fatty i understand the struggle. Boy that shirt is wayyyy toooo tight. Joe make this guy a bigger size for Christ sake. I know I wouldn’t be comfortable in that shit. Peace
Or maybe del could lose weight as a former fatty 280 5ft 10 now 175 just lose weight brother not a  healthy way to live
"A lot of good people had hope for this game and no I ain't talking about me, I am talking about the people who defended this till the end."
What's the brand of that tablet cover? It looks pretty nice.
you kids need lives
Stop bitching lol
Pfft year one 😂 as if there's going to be a year 2
"""You will meet people with shady backgrounds and questionable motives"" Huh, I wonder if EA's higher ups know that Devs put them in the game?"
"1:09:30
Swears the whole hour but bleeps ""God damn"" lol"
the roadmap was deleted just a few days ago. Let that sink in
"i guess that's the problem with game industry these day's
other products has to be off a certain quality or has been true some testing before u can buy it in the store.
But it feels like game developers etc etc.
can sell u a broken game and let pay 60 dollers."
i would consider this game if it goes over a major redo and if AJ says it's worth getting now
I want to play the Anthem Joe described.
my ony complaint on anthem is that i dindn't like how jerma985 voiced the main character
excuse me what
Nah Borderlands 2 is too slow. Every chest feels 4 seconds too long to open.
"”Are they going to fix this? Yes, eventually.”
This did not age well."
"How even was the cataclysm, I didn't even pay attention to it"
"I love he pointed out the roadmap after saying this, considering it doesn’t exist anymore."
Every Fallout and Elder Scrolls fan ever
"Well, they're fixing it with Anthem 2.0. God only knows when that's coming out though."
" @purgejmi  I have a friend who works at BioWare Austin, he said that the launch of Anthem 2.0 is going to be 30th February 2021"
Ravi Pathak lol....
 @signas501  v.C. 6
Not at all haha
"Anthem 2.0, good joke"
 @purgejmi  lmfao
They will fix it in a path called Anthem 2.
 @Jerimbo  i only played one mission and it was timed.... i don't know what it was about at all....
"God Borderlands 3 is gona be fun. Moze is gona be the perfect heavy gunner, and I love loot ,tones of loot. Also there's a 5 year old game called ""no more room in hell"" on steam that lets you talk with your characters and say where stuff is, so."
"""There are good grinds and there are bad grinds""
hehe"
The best looter shooter series is borderlands period
13:00 May or June? Na son more like August they are finally released hahah
2 thousand dislikes are all EA bots.
Dude... Destiny 2 is the best looter shooter. Borderlands is better than Borderlands 2 and neither of those games have real rememberable loot
"Wow, Angry Joe with TWO WHOLE HOURS of Angry content on one game, you know it's bad."
Aaaaand no road map
11:30 When I saw this game I was so hyped and I was telling my self if this game gonna be good I need to buy a powerfull PC that can run this on maximum details.
If this game teamed up with like bungie or like teams other than ea this would be one of the greatest looter shooters ever
I bet that these big game companies are laundering money...its a digital product tied to work hours that can be manipulated and skewed to show WAY more time(work hours) being used to build said game...i wouldn't be surprised if more nefarious shit starts happening ...like cartels realizing that they could launder millions through games and game developer companies...you can sell a digital item for whatever price you deem fit...
"If that's true, then there must be an investigation into that! And honestly, I would not be surprised."
lmao ea is gonna finally die
not until the casual gamer start caring
"never know how looter shooters fail so hard, i mean its just an rpg with guns instead of swords.....why is that so hard. these developers act like they have to go from a hand carved rock to a space shuttle"
I hated Boarderlands 2. There was A difficulty SPIKE at level 14 at the Hydro Plant: That made me delete the game. It never dropped me Any Amazing loot. I had to Grind to level 23 looking for Dropps and STILL couldn't get pass the Hydro Plant. Retarded Checkpoint System.
Sounds like you needed to get good or a friend
"it's August, Cataclysm's finally released..... and they're shit lol."
Random Angry Review playthrough Day 2 review 4/172 05/08/19 great stuff lads nice one
These loading screens are up there with SONIC 06.
The E3 trailer Game would of been Soo Fucking badass .I would of Loved to get that game it would of Put Bioware Wayyyyyyy up there an EA but the Retail wazzzzzzz Bssss its TrueLy Sad an False advertisement
Warframe is a looter shooter lol? Ok lol
"I love Warframe, but I don't consider it a looter shooter. It would drop weapons and armor and not blueprints and mats if it was."
It is a looter shooter
"people are complaining on Twitter that they want their money back, that the entire staff has abandoned the game like nothing happened."
If youre not going to give your cast a chance to say anything dont keep them on a panel.
JOE LET ME SHAVE DELLS NASTY ASS BEARD
IS IT WEIRD THAT I WANT TO SHAVE DELLS BEARD REALLY BAD?!?!?!?!?
"""This is called our world, my story""
WOW!
I would really like to play that game!
It's not Anthem, that's for sure!"
Your videos are hilarious 😂 thanks
"Please lose that Delrith guy he is really annoying and he comes off as either wanting to copy AJ or he comes off as getting into the gaming industry with no real work,"
"He is knowledgeable about many games, he goes in depth."
Just because Borderlands had different guns that did different things doesn’t mean they were effective.
I just want a looter shooter that is essentially the Diablo II of this generation. Destiny and Borderlands are the only games that are closest to that
The ping system was in battlefield for the longest....
"It’s amazing how long this game survived on sheer fanboyism alone, people that are so dedicated to proving that BioWare couldn’t make a bad game that they force themselves to play the same boring shit over and over and over. I barely made it halfway through the campaign before canceling my EA subscription and deleting it to play something that was actually fun."
Warframe does it so much beter
How long do you want a review
"This is hilarious to look at 3 months later with the roadmap for this game gone and the game with no serious direction. Please, just let BioWare make RPG's again, not live service multiplayer games EA, not every game needs to be multiplayer to be fun."
16:20? Lips not moving
"Whenever I hear people classify Fallout 76 as a looter-shooter-type I sort of die inside. That’s not what Fallout was made to be, but now it’s a live-service, battle royale, looter-shooter."
"""I saved the damn world, bitch, shut up!"""
No one cares about pings Joe Apex Legends is garbage. Its already dead online.
FUCK YOU EA
"Imagine if they gave us an actual amazing game like red dead redemption or the witcher and implement the games as service now that would be a good deal and probably 5-10 years of gameplay, but no its EA so fuck them"
"I really like these guys, there honest and straight to the point... There not sell outs"
"Joe my man , pls fix the fluctuation in  your audio on the discussion series before uploading them, I can understand if it live but this just straight up murder my headphone."
Remember the TV commercial? ALL ABOARD! HAHAHAHAHAHA
"During anthem's development, the devs must have mixed up a looter shooter with a loading screen simulator."
"Greetings from the 1st of June.
Roadmap delayed, everything still broken, game basically dead.
Guess Bioware's a goner."
Rip.
the comments from the defenders of this trash fest got hella egg on their faces
 @tommytheotaku828  probably an omelette by now considering how much they've been burnt
 @MiorAkif  with a pot full of grits along with it...
Can I get another update?
" @Daniel-or9zu  Still dead. I tried last week to get into Tyrant Mine at hard dificulty and it didn't find people, I ended up doing it on my own basically"
Joe pls fix your damn videos. Just fix them. Im tired of hearing a video with my volume on 12% to be able to not bleed from ears and then on next video everyone is whispering and I have my volume on 100% and then again your very next video is 60 million decibels and destroys my house. ADJUST YOUR VOLUME LEVELS. 10 years now you didnt do not once. And I do love all your videos so I have no choice than bleeding from my brain over and over again.
"The funny thing is that they didn't restart development at some point, development never started in the first place until a year out from release."
"Six years from now, moders Will fix the game and add COOL shit like New weapons and Thomas the tank engine"
"I'd rather listen to ""I'm commander Shepard and this is my favorite store on the Citadel"" 15 times than that Anthem crap."
BOYCOTT EA
"Hey, would you pay me some money for me to punch you in the face?
Oh, no, no! Don't worry! I'll definitely get you a nice vacation later. ... What? Don't you trust me? :^)"
watching this at the end portion of May and the cataclysms have been delayed in to the unforeseeable future and there is so little players left that matchmaking in to full groups is not possible any more..
Man this fat dude needs to lay off the games and the junk food and get his shit sorted or he won't be making these reviews long. Looks like my brother's future self lol
Å
My friend got it for $60 and if I had the money I would've smacked him but he's across the country
So glad i stayed away from this dumpster fire.
At least Fallout 76 is fun to roleplay with friends. Anthem has literally no upside.
"Other joe is always so quiet when they have a discussion. 
Other joe must be like: why am I here... 
J.K love them 💕"
The road map is delayed indefinitely
"> Roadmap
Ha. Ha. Ha. Was I the only one who knew from the start that this roadmap shit wouldn't go anywhere?"
"Watching this the second time, I actually prefer those over normal reviews.
But then it's like RLM half in the bag :P"
Why does prospero look like Anjit Pai?
The sad thing is that Anthem is a good game. They just gave us like 20% of it 🙄.
21:49 ah i remember warframe used to have that problem where dmg abilities did not scale to enemies(still kinda has that problem with some warframes) but we did have utility and cc abilities so you could still do stuff other than shoot the enemies with certain warframes. Now the problem with anthem in regards to abilities being useless is that there are no javelins that provide utility and cc. Ahhh brings back fond memories.
This big boy in the video says Anthem and it's stronghold has shortened his life span... should be worried about those rolls under that floppy shirt doing the same...
It's May 2019 and the road map was thrown away and the game is dead by Biowares own admission. RIP Anthem 2019-2019.
They didn’t make the game who are they question it
They should have been testing the game and working with the devs
interrupting Joe show
"I wonder if EA is perhaps so toxic as a publisher/overseer that good game studios become paralyzed and become unable to create. EA kills the muze. 
When I hear news about EA it is almost without exception in connection with destruction and mayhem."
"A.Plosky As far as I've been able to figure out, EA really did take a backseat on this game, giving Bioware free reign on a PvE game with monetization. What killed it was that who they had as the leads simply did not work together, and refused to relent to one another's ideas, resulting in little to no changes or decisions. EA may have driven the team's best creative individuals away, but with Anthem it was the people left over that ended up letting the game fail. Goes to show what happens when people refuse to actually work together and compromise. Even uninspired people can make interesting things, I myself do it a lot, but this was mostly just lack of creativity in general and stubborness."
" @lsfaraone  by default EA is responsible, they greenlit the product as good enough to be sold for some reason lol naw it's on EA for making this hot mess accessible,  devs can't just release a game with out the parent company having a say"
"You know my biggest big fuck you im doing to EA, I bought destiny 2, cause I’d rather deal with bungie than EA"
"Shocker Cody999 Yeah, I'm currently doing stuff, did the latest Zero Hour mission for an exotic from D1, and that one quest was better than anything in Anthem. Destiny has its issues, but it's still better than Anthem in almost every way."
I have a personal obsession with ignoring initial releases of ANYTHING simply due to my desire to binge it all straight to the end and that policy is for ANIME it's sad that i now feel the need to add that policy to gaming
"Prospero's a Corporate, Propogandistic BITCH!

REMEMBER... THE NAZI'S INVESTED IN PRESENTATION ALSO! ... E.A. DICKS"
When you watch this after the article telling the truth about anthem's development XD
Why should anyone take a beta test seriously if it is right before release. I feel like legitimate beta tests should be happening about 6 months before release.
"Ace326 Because that's what they're supposed to be. Some few idiots seriously tried arguing with me about that, completely disregarding that the MAJORITY of competent industry professionals will tell you a beta is supposed to be approximately like 4-8 months before you actually release a game due to the fact that it takes about that long to iron out certain bugs before you have to release the game."
" @lsfaraone  It is obvious that the ""pre-order and then play in the beta"" is just a marketing gimmick that has completely spiraled out of control. Anthems Beta was 2 or 3 weeks before release if I remember correctly. The unfortunate truth is that it is hard to say whether or not it was even truly in beta considering the lack of content and incredibly buggy game. The whole game was a chopped together mess that lacks actual substance. The only good idea in Anthem was the flying and powers, but even those have some bad elements to them."
"was my comment deleted? that's low man, il have to repost, ah and its back lol"
"Whole f***ing gaming industry is in shambles. Loot boxes, micro transactions, mvps, greedy attitude all over. Sad..."
"how about you openyour eyes, instead og playing shit like this? dumbass"
Thank god I dont play shitty AAA trash.
I am so happy you said Borderlands 2! Best looter shooter ever!
Sad.  I'm so relieved I didn't buy this game.  It looked so amazing and cool.  Thank goodness I decided to wait and see what happened.  Definitely I'll wait for Metroid prime 4
6 years in pre production not development the last 18 months was development. 6 years and they couldn't come up with unique weapons no special weapons like Destiny or Diablo. No special javelin's with special armour bit what's the point when you don't even have a stats page. And that's pointless because weapons don't mean shit the base weapon turned out to be the most powerful weapon
my first master work was beating the last boss at the end of the game I played another hour thinking there was more.
"3 grown men knocking a game..... should be knocking some pussy, playing with kids, working cause making videos on youtube is bitch work."
"whats the best looter shooter now


Borderlands 3: Y E S"
I heart Trump ;) and I liked this video
Left 4 dead did the pinging first.
charge backed these ass holes.  Tried being civil requested a refund because the game did not run on my pc or was so laggy and buggy i could not enjoy it.  Got treated like dog shit.  GG EA / Bio-wear.  Got my money back and im done with your alls shit.
Their discussion exemplifies why video games suck now!
"26:03 -- ""What I'm trying to say is, I feel like nobody at Bioware actually played the game from start to finish before it released."" 

40 days later, it turned out that @AngryJoeShow was DEAD the fuck on with this statement. Jason Schreier, for all the bad news he's brought gamers over the years, has been an irreplaceable resource for the community. He IS the greatest source of truth in gaming history, and the folks at AJS ARE the greatest collective voice for a community chasing that truth in gaming history."
I totally forgot about anthem until I saw this video
Now we know The truth from The kotako article
Damn 3 to 4 videos on anthem...you really wanted this game to succeed lol
Duh we all did
"Now we know that demo was entirely fake, since they didnt hhave a game yet when they showed it to us"
"if EA gonna give me a expansion pack or DLC that needs to be paid.
I'm gonna ask for refund."
I'm convinced that people who buy EA products are idiots or are insane. What the fuck did you expect?
"""This is going to be the first hour and twenty minute review and I didn't want that to happen"" makes hour and ten minute extended review lol still love the content, anthem let me down harder than I ever thought possible personally, time to move on."
"A while back I said destiny 2 was crap, and I'd never play that game...I tried Anthem, and now I play destiny 2"
EA's only crime is touching Bioware in the first place. And now the company's eating shit while EA is still jerking us off while snatching your wallets in your moment of bliss.
"Now that the new article has come out...it was revealed the game was done in even less time (12 to 16 months). Wow, so glad I didnt buy this crap."
"Given how much incompetence there was on both EA and Bioware's part, that they even managed to put out a functioning product in that time frame is a miracle in itself."
" @NorthStarBlue1    True, which explains a lot"
"Once I seen all the bs to open the tombs, I quit. Screw that man. There was no incentive to do them. The game as it is today is unplayable. Game sucks. I will check back in on it in 6 months."
They should add a flying mechanism in Borderlands 3.
1400 hours into destiny 2 lol ....
why is warframe consider a looter shooter?
Hey Han! Stop talking over Chewie!
Another great Angry team so glad I wait for your vids before I waste my money on games I am not sure of.
EA is giving us the MVP experience.
You're expanded reviews are awesome!!  Keep'm coming.
fat bearded mans signature move > plucking at his t-shirt
Why does anyone buy EAs products anymore? How many chances does this company get?
You can't talk about destiny 2 being good here. You paid 60 bucks for the base game --> shit. You paid 20 for expansion 1 --> still shit. You paid 20 for expansion 2 --> even still shit. You paid 40 for taken king 2.0 --> all of a sudden it's good. No fuck that you shouldn't have to pay 140 bucks in order to play a game that's just as good as other games that are that way from launch at 60 bucks. You should check yourselves before making comments like that.
"First of all, how much something costs doesn’t determine how good a game is. Secondly, they did changes outside of just the expansions that improved the game."
"28:30 I have never even played this game and I can see where they were trying to go before EA came in and said ""Release this game now and we can fix it later..."" This is the new way to make games. They (EA, Bethesda…) put out the BARE F**** MINIMUM and then they can just make patches later... WTF!!! And people buy it up like crazy and don't ask for refunds when it is this bad. Anthem will not have any players by the time they fix it and that is just sad and I can see this in other games and since people buy it and pre-order it, they make their money so it does work our for them! It is sad, but, it is working for EA and other AAA studios. STOP PRE-ORDERING!!! PLEASE!!!"
"My other problem, is that EA doesn't want to make a good product, they want to make a profitable product, they could give two shits about how good this game is, as long as it makes money...it is fine with them. They DO NOT care about the quality of the game!!! They just care about you buying it and that is why the E3 gameplay is different to the actual game. They just wanted you to buy it. That's all."
"Origin access is basically their suckers tag, it should have been to test the game but they were to busy counting the cash from their sheep."
"Please everyone upvote this, I CAN'T even play the game or log on, I have to try for 30 minutes minimum to log in once, then I get kicked at the end of missions. Its actually gotten worse as time went by."
Anthem's loading screens rival Bloodborne's Day 1 loading screens!
49:12 Did Joe just put his Bethesda Rose Colored Glasses back on? That happened in their Video Games all the time despite what some might say. Skyrim Quote Memes anyone?
"Everything EA touches turns to shit. Or in my favorite studios cases, they die!!"
"Man, y'all so official! What's next, suits?!? Lol jk."

My intention is not to foment discord or to be a rabble-rousing troublemaker. EA has done a great job of doing that all by themselves.  However, the very, very painful exercise of watching EA and BioWare attempt to launch Anthem brings to the surface some really angry feelings because I am one of the suckers who paid them in cash during a retail transaction for a purported AAA game that was ready to launch. 

Let me state that I have been involved in the software industry for decades, I’ve held roles as developer. tester, project manager, implementation, administration, C level executive, and everything in between.  

I understand the business of software, and of game development. I understand why certain business decisions are made in software, so I come at this post with an abundance of knowledge. 

This game is nowhere near complete and it should never have been released at this point in time. Having said all that it is clear to me that EA is using the retail channel to support development of their game. Essentially, they are Crowdsourcing the funds to finish the game.  

One has to wonder why exactly the decision was made to release the game now. That decision by itself was flawed because it put Anthem on competitive grounds with Apex Legends.  From a business decision perspective you have to wonder if the executives at EA have a clue as to what they’re doing and why anyone would invest cash into EA seeing how disastrous the executive leadership of the company's decision making is.

Well it's hard to believe the executives at EA and BioWare to completely ignorant and to some extent probably do know what they’re doing – which leaves the true option we should consider which is they wanted the cash and didn’t care that the game was unfinished. This is only logical conclusion that we can come up with… after so many years in development the company was desperately seeking revenue to offset those costs. Unfortunately, the developers did not deliver for whatever reason and I don’t care what the reason is. Management at EA apparently wanted to recoup some money and really didn’t care how damaging their actions could be to themselves and the gaming industry as a whole.  Also, I don’t think they considered the liability position that they have put themselves in now (more on that later). 

Having experienced a month of patches with each successive Patch breaking more things, and doesn’t actually fix anything substantially, it’s becoming painfully obvious that the development team is either misguided or clearly doesn’t know what they’re doing. It’s entirely possible that executive leadership is directing them to do incredibly stupid things, or they just suck at writing code and testing it, or both.  

It’s really hard to say which one it is because it’s nearly unbelievable that the dev team actually tests this software or plays this game before releasing it given how in-your-face the bugs are.  This is about as botched as it gets and I never imagined the day where I would buy a game that was buggier and unfinished than The Division was, but Bioware was determined to show everyone just how screwed up of a game they could release. Meanwhile Massive and UbiSoft took their flaws seriously and fixed The Division, and launched a gem with The Division 2.

However there’s a problem that goes beyond just releasing a buggy game and I believe that EA crossed the line that protects consumers in the US, namely the Consumer Protection laws.  

I know there is a fine line here especially in software and I understand the delicate balance between fixing every bug and getting a product that is good enough out the door. Anthem goes nowhere near either one of those and is in such a bad state that consumers could complain that they didn’t receive what was advertised.   

Could you imagine how angry you would be if your computer or cell phone had as many flaws as Anthem does? or how about your car, or your refrigerator or your TV, or the clothes you buy, or just about anything else that you Purchase in a retail setting. Now that could be a fun game…coming up with ways different consumer products could be defective inspired by the Anthem debacle…such as you buy a new car and go to start it but instead the windows roll down and the horn sounds! 

Frankly I think that if people started demanding refunds from EA, Microsoft and Sony (copies sold via their stores) then EA would be forced to behave like a company that respects the public market they have the privilege of selling into.  If, or rather when, these company reject your refund request then I would say that people should file complaints with their state Attorney’s General. The point of the AG is to protect the consumer and EA is making a turkey shoot of the consumer market. If you don’t know who the AG is in your state, just query Google. 

If this were a piece of software targeting a business then I wouldn’t say any of this because you’re supposed to know what you’re doing in business. However, the target customer is the US retail consumer and certain protection laws apply. 

The behavior exhibited by EA and Bioware cannot be allowed to stand and sets a terrible precedence for the game and software industry as a whole. And this behavior should be punished to deter it from happening again.  They are the ones who made the decisions to release the game in the state that it is, instead of continuing to refine the code until they got it right or at least to the point where they could reasonably say they delivered what was advertises – they are nowhere near that now.  

Meanwhile the company is asking everyone who shelled out their hard earned money to stick around and wait some indeterminate period of time, probably up to a year before the game is properly playable.  And I’m going to use a quote from the game itself to describe what is happening with the executive decisions in the game “That’s just wrong”. 

I firmly believe that business schools should use this as a case study on how not to create and release software. I also believe that EA unwittingly damaged the long-term revenue possibilities of this game by releasing it this way. What’s going to happen is the player base will abandon the game and quite possibly file lawsuits for consumer fraud.  

But even worse for EA, another competent studio and competent publisher will create a game with similar mechanics because it’s fun to fly around like Iron Man and Anthem publicly demonstrates this.  Too bad for EA and BioWare because there are a lot of good developers out there who can make a game with similar mechanics.  

I am not going to stick around while Bioware figures out how to write in test code before giving it to the public. Now, pay attention: if Massive and Ubisoft put jetpacks in the division 2 I believe half the player base of Anthem would immediately flock to that product.  

So I don’t know what’s in Bioware and EA’s future but it could be class action lawsuits and administrative actions against them. I’m in favor of the litigation and looking for the first attorney to file the class action suit.  Enough nonsense from a company that enjoys all the benefits of the US consumer market while flaunting the rules that protect consumers from defective products."
"You're all over the place... I don't understand, what needed to be said that wasn't said already ?
You said you worked in the software dev industry for a long time. I don't know ,I guess I expect a  more precise analysis from someone with so much experience. Something ain't right. Especially when you mentioned class action lawsuits. It makes no sense."
" @eval_is_evil  I wasn't about to get into the specific details of the analysis you allude to regarding costs, schedules, etc., in this forum as it's not needed.  The most important part of the post is that EA knowingly released a game that was unfinished to the consumer market. Half of the value proposition of the game is missing- essentially cheating consumers of money based on the promise of a game that was purportedly complete but we all know it's no where near fit to be released.  If you don't understand the legislative implications of consumer law, go educate yourself and come back to continue the discussion.  Thanks."

The moment when you realize that Andromeda's multiplayer is better than Anthem's lmao
Yep a single player game that isn't suited for multiplayer is still better than a live service😭😭 I love that comment
WHY ARE PEOPLE STILL BUYING EA GAMES CAN SOMEONE TELL ME THIS? CHRIST AL FUCKING MIGHTY ITS LIKE THEY NEVER FUCKING LEARN
The long and frequent loading screens are due to the fact that the game is extremely graphics intensive.
"Can i uh....can i have one more stronghold
NO! 😂😂"
"If EA wants me to play this game they have to do three simple things;
1. Send me a free copy of the game
2. Send me a minimum of $10, or more if you’re feeling generous EA, we know you have the money. I want physical money. A physical $10 bill. It’s for payment for wasting my time and playing the game
3. A personal handwritten letter to me, apologizing for being this awful greedy company and screwing over players for YEARS now. I want this letter to be sign by every single executive. Every big suit has to sign this letter. 

Honestly I’m even considering adding in a handwritten essay that explains why the game is released in this state and what your actual goals are for your game and how you plan on achieving them. I would want like brutal honesty so I could get them to hand write how they would fuck us over or hold them to whatever standard they come up with"
"I If you think this game is shit, why even bother play or expect anything from it in the future? obviously this game Crap... Why even try? Why are you guys hopeful? This game is far from what we were promised.  This game is the Worst game released ever in the history of gaming a total disappointment. Whats wrong: the amount of Loading screens, Boring story, terrible interaction, lack of game experience, no pvp...  awful..."
The really tragic thing is that this game probably has to do a lot with why ME:Andromeda failed. So they killed or at least seriously damaged a great franchise for this.
Is a new character sheet on the DLC roadmap timeline?
"Well, as I've said for many years now. You can either have a deep, story rich experience. OR, you can have co-op and/or multiplayer."
"Hmm, Halo 1 dis a pretty good job of it."
"""And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all."""
"I'm not sure why Joe's praising Apex so much
The game is trash too
It's just fortnite for people not secure about playing fortnite
Sure there's no building, less customizability but the whole ""path pointer"" is just... practically pathetic.
It's realistic sure but, is that is? Most people that are competent have a bit of gamesense and don't need all those extra tools for FINDING your gameplay."
"Played the Beta, didn’t purchase the game. Simple."
Hi
"Long story short, ""Anthem sucks"" ""Yeah Anthem sucks"" but hey I'm getting division 2 on Friday and am gonna try destiny 2 again"
I really like the gameplay and graphics of this game but fuck! The end game grind is horrible lol I WANT to love this game but it’s really hard to love it when when the game is just consistent rinse and repeat BS. They need more content. At this point I’m wishing that I would’ve bought Division 2 instead. I’m getting the division 2 this payday. Ima play that until anthem gets it shit together. Hopefully it does at some point
And the cosmetics/armor are the most disappointing I’ve ever seen in any game ever! Especially in an RPG LOOTER SHOOTER! fuck man this bums me out having to leave comments like this while I’m trying to play this stupid game lol
31:10 what the hell is a blue shotgun?
"I’ve been playing a lot of anthem this weekend and I got to say, it’s a lot of fun! I know despite all the hate , it’s really enjoyable"
"Wait till you beat the story, there's literally nothing to do except replay the same missions or strongholds over and over. Gets boring real quick and becomes a pure loot grind."
"Jebuslives damn , that would honestly suck haha, well I’m almost done with the game so we shall see"
"Prophetofhope 24 I was thinking the end game would have new high level shit to do but it’s literally the same strongholds and generic missions you have been doing the whole time. The only difference is the difficulty level. Most people at my level, 25, just repeat tyrant mine over and over. Starting to get really bored with the game which was not the case prior to completing the campaign. I never get any good loot either."
"I have posted this before...but these sit down discussions are bad ass. Would love a podcast style discussion like this to become something a bit more regular. Love the channel AJ, have for years now and I'm glad that Del and OJ are supporting!"
Tell me this doesn't feel like a smart phone game. Im really upset at myself for buying this. I played for 5 hours and was over it. I honestly believe these companies should be sued for false advertisement and every customer should get a full refund. That's how bad this game is.
"Bioware was never good in making NPC's that move around and interact with each other... Mass Effect trilogy had great characters, but they were always in place... Dragon age too (only played origins).. But not improving that after 10+ years is just lazy..."
"Well, you played the best of them all ( Dragon age ) so thats all that matter x)"
"So me and girlfriend are still playing and one of the biggest frustrations is , she has luck on all the items she has equipped, at the grand master level and hasn't gotten grand master drops . I on the other hand have a sniper rifle equipped with luck and i have been getting grand master drops .  Granted I don't every time but, and game play set to grand master play. Yet she and I will play normal and she has gotten drops but not for her class.She is level 30 with alliance tier 10 , I am 27 with alliance tier 6 playing grand master level freeplay and I get a master craft item instead of her , pissed her off. First time I heard her criticize the game , especially spending $79 ."
I'd love another discussion on anthem joe i do play anthem and I don't find the game that bad but I've already moved on to the division 2 because I think we can all agree that the division 2 is way better and I was honestly surprised with the way the division 2 came out.
"For the money and time and talent tossed at this,  the game is pathetic.  I actually feel bad for EA.  Mark my words Bioware will be shut down,  and after 110 hours in Anthem,  I wont feel bad at all.  
Incompetence at almost all levels."
"Can Ben irving watch these videos, it feels like he’s never learn any shit from the gaming world"
"You ever noticed how the reward for every fucking challenge besides like 4 of them is 2000 Coin? I bet that was intended as just a fucking placeholder and they wanted to put some real rewards there ""later""."
"it’s a conspiracy to insulate pockets with a people-group’s time, devotion and money."
"My guess, this game was initially designed as a singleplayer game and than revamped to meet the requirements for a ""live service game"""
Sternencolonel yuuuuup
Even as a single player it wouldn't live up to anybody's expectations
How did u not review metro exodus
"Wait... CORPORATE IS BLACK!?! The plot thickens! Here i thought he bore an uncanny resemblance to Joe, but I guess i was silly to think in such a manner!"
"EA has a serious case of gas!
Joe 1 ++1
Joe 2 is slipping (get on him J1)!"
If Joe waits until R* has a chance to vastly improve RDO before he reviews it I'm so done. Tired of these guys letting R* off the hook while being extremely critical of other games with the same issues.
R.I.P. Bioware… Mass Effect 2 was the best game I ever played. But it sold its soul to the Devil. EA owns Bioware outright and can't split off like Bungie did. EA historically would rather kill the studio over selling off a valuable intellectual property to someone who won't totally fuck it all up.
I actually really like it. I'm excited for Anthems future.
Mass Effect was sacrificed for this generic game
"This why games speak for themselves, if you need to market it, generally its crap."
Exactly
2 hours total of AJ ripping on Anthem. Completely deserved.
"Anthem was clearly a single player game in its initial conception. A rich, dynamic world? Choices that matter? Shady characters with questionable character as a result of your actions? 

Mass Effect. 

It's so blatantly obvious that EA jumped on the ""Games as a Live Service"" model to promote a game that should have been a Single Player experience, to a niche market with a fresh consumer base. It backfired awfully. EA don't seem to remember who they raised in 2009 and now that their orginal family left, they pulled in the cousins who had no prior experience in world building and storytelling. We lost legends, guys. 

Legends."
"In a parallel reality/universe Bioware sells the Dragon Age IP to CD Projekt,  in a last  attempt to save  a franchise from EA."
"I was going to pick this up a year from now, when the game is actually done, but I've decided not to. I don't want to do business with any company that would blatantly lie, and not even have the dignity to apologize for it. It's a dirty business practice and I hope someone sues them for it."
Borderlands 2 - Yet again for the win.
"When borderlands 3 comes out, that's when we'll get a real looter shooter."
Borderlands 3 was garbage and by the way destiny is a real looter shooter what are you talking about forsaken had released around that time completely changed overhauled everything brought the grind back for og players
"Sounds like this game needs a complete FFXIV style overhaul. Get a new director, fire everyone, rehire some new employees, and then basically kill the world so they can rebuild it better.
I think the game has potential. Just needs a full on plastic surgeon, not a face lift."
3 strongholds at launch! Are you kidding me??? Fucking bogus
"If you're not already, (in which case you're an idiot) please boycott EA for all and eternity"
"A lot of people are wandering why Bethesda or EA are releasing half baked products and just plain bad games. It's actually easy and obvious. It's all about investment and return. These companies are getting bigger and bigger and are probably run by corporate suits, which have no clues about videogames but have their head full of marketing notions. Fallout 76, considering the overall quality, didn't require a lot of money to produce (same engine, assets, bugs, etc) but from a marketing point of view was still successful because a lot of people bought it considering the success of the overall franchise. Was it a commercial success? Definitely not, but it probably made more money than how much it required to produce it. Anthem was a Minimum Viable Product, releasing a product with only basic features, kinda like a big ""focus test group"", and if the customers likes it, the company will improve on it. Too bad this system doesn't work for videogames. I think this is the only reasonable interpretation for the behavior of these companies. In the end, it's probably profitable, because they still get a higher return compared to the initial investment (ROI). Does this mean this is a good strategy? It is according to the corporate suits, but terrible for the overall quality of the products. Long story short, vote with your wallets, never preorder, buy the standard editions and wait for the reviews before purchasing. It's the only way to make this system not profitable anymore. Sorry for the long post."
EA have a big part of guilty ..like Battlefield 5 was launched without Battle Royal ..Anthem without raids ...and Bioware need to go to school to learn what  makes a looter shooter addicting
Great review guys just wanted to point out one error you guys can see your face but the catch is you can only see your face with the default helmets lmfao. So it’s still broken only works with original helmets for each class 😂😂
Fix your shit bioware and ea
I hope they really fix their game cause I love the look of it but I hate that everything that is missing or not there
"Mass Effect died for this
One of my favourite franchises died for this."
Logan 06 preach mass effect trilogy remastered
Brat Nation i would like a game that shows what happens after the trilogy
Logan 06 That’s not a bad idea actually
Yeah dude it’s fucked
"Logan 06 It’s called Andromeda, and it killed the original Mass Effect trilogy, even before this game."
 @warblackjack5565  the team who made Andromeda was not the main branch of Bioware. The main branch was 'working' on Anthem instead.
Mass effect killed itself. 3 was the death bell and Andromeda was the grave.
 @BratNation  Mass Effect trilogy remaster would make my year
Rip son
"I need a new ending for mass effect 3 first. And it would be simple for bioware, simply adopt the fan theory that the end of the game is inside shepherds head as he's being indoctrinated and have the forth game pick up from the moment Shep gets hit by harbingers laser"
@John Watson I would love a prequel set like 10 years before the original. It would be more relaxed instead of the universe ending it could be a more personal story where you're a bounty Hunter  or something
@John Watson yeah that would be great if you could pick. I'd want to be a krogan or an asari.
I know i'm so sad :(
Did you get the remaster??
Why do people buy shit like that?
30:45 games have had pinging systems before apex legends dafuq lol. vermintide has literally the exact same thing you're saying. characters can ping items and the character will say a line to get your attn. apex did not revolutionlize gaming. it's just another shitty battle royale. i love fps games and apex is boring af. play something like dusk or amid evil instead.
I like the game. It does have problems though.  Tell me a newer game that hasn't come out with issues?  I like what I like.
@Dark Night because I like the game I have hopeless  taste according to YOU? I guess the world would be an awesome place if we all thought like you!  Thank you for your valuable contribution. I will strive to be better like you!

"A friend from work saved me from buying this shit by saying ""bro, do not trust EA""."
"Maybe standardizing a game contents for looter shooter games  especially ""Live-service-games"" should be a thing  so devs know what players  would expect  in a game.  So the devs would know that if they can't deliver standard   game content expectation  of players,  they know that the game would not sell."

"@angryjoe. A bioware employee dis play through the game before release and posted negative things, and pointed out issues. EA fired him."
1 hour in angry joe gets angry ! For real! BioWare ! Shocking ! Angry joe lives up to his namesake 🤔🙂🙂🙂👍
I am so happy i did not buy this

"Loot games have been done successfully many times before. You could use the same progression algorithm for items of games that have worked before - such as Diablo series, Torch Light series, Borderland series, Dungeon Siege series, or even WarFrame. There is really no excuse for not being able to figure out a progression system of loot for current gen games."
I need a division 2 review!!!
"What more can you expect from a company that says ""single player games are dead’"

For fuck sakes Capcom and monster hunter are shitting on EA in both regards, single and multiplayer. If youre gonna say something that bold atleast have a game that shows success. Everything so far has been a fucking failure and anyone that follows EA's lead goes down that road. COUGH COUGH BETHESDA."
Elemental weapons are in the game....i have a masterwork rifle that has  something like a 30% chance to shock.  I not defending this broken PoS....im tired of wasting the temp buffs that you craft when you go into a game and its an empty completed instance and boom.....3 epic buffs wasted.

wirussak agreed. Seems a lot more like everyone waiting for the other person to stop talking so they can have their say instead of an actual discussion.
"Writing the game off too early. It’ll likely trickle along like Division & Destiny did. 

Unfortunate that games in this genre seems incapable of learning anything from each other (other than being shallow with poor ttk for a year+)."
Why is no one comparing this with no mans lie?
"Because that game had an excuse, it was made by a mobile dev that actually tried and eventually managed to fix the game. This game was made by a AAA studio that has created amazing games in the past"
"I tried the open beta and was quite excited to try it out. Then I played it for 20 minutes and proceeded to uninstalled it. 
After 20 minutes I could tell that this game was empty and would be absolutely no joy to play. 
Glad I made that decision."
EA really needs to start giving refunds back to people.
This might be his longest rant ever😂😂😂
I don't think Bioware can really salvage this game it should have never been released
"I love this game in general but i agree with everything you guys are saying. I would have rather waited another year for a completed game with more content, less bugs, and an overall finished product. Do you think EA is responsible for much of this? I feel corporate white collar people cause many issues."
"16:18
del would be a great ventriloquist"
"Just like the Simpsons, when they sang: ""Just don't look."" To kill the giant billboard monsters, just stop buying half baked, microtransaction bugged junk. I know it's a hard thing to do because games promise a lot before release, and  being a fan you always want to have the latest, but it's not worth it any more. Every cent in their pocket keeps encouraging these shady, money grabbing practices. If Fallout 76 or this game has taught us anything is that developers are going to keep doing this so long as they can make ANY money while doing so."
Getting stuck behind walls in strongholds tho...why is that even a thing???
And people said it would be a Destiny killer ha! They just want to justify buying a EA game (a looter shooter EA game at that)
Just bought the game because I played the start at my friend’s house thinking that the loot would be diverse. I am now very worried at what my perspective will be on the game now as I keep playing.
Chris Tsiflidis so what do you think?
I'm glad they took most of there staff to work on this unfinish game. While their other project has suffered. People that still play swtor and raid frequently have had no new expansion in 2 years. Good job!
Holy shit an extended discussion I'm down
I saw Wheel of the Worst watched in Joe's recommended in the youtube clip and I clapped! Is Rich replacing Joe?!
for 60$ in warframe I can get hell lot of platinum and buy almost all deluxe skins
"teams getting splitted again and again like lord voldemort's horcruxes because of too much projects and obligations will make worse products in the end. 
plans will be changed constantly, promises broken repeatedly, and corners will be cut to pieces."
I bought anthem and played it unfortunately it took me 5 days to get through what amounted to about 3 hours of gameplay I managed to get my interceptor up to the gear lvl that the javelins were in the demo but haven't gone back to it since because honestly I found it to be such a disappointment for a bioware game that I can't be bothered to go back to it after 6 years of development and games like destiny 1 & 2 warframe etc what we got is unacceptable I can honestly say after 3 hours of gameplay over 5 days I went back to ark survival evolved because even with all its problems ( and they are MANY) ark is ACTUALLY worth my time if you haven't bought anthem yet take it from me don't bother spend your money on literally anything else
Saving my money for Cyberpunk 2077.
good!
Have to get mk11 then I'll wait for cyberpunk on the pc side of things. If we talking nintendo then that's a different story lol.
Saving mine for Dying Light 2
WAR BLACKJACK same and ghost recon breakpoint
 @fire-du8jr  don't save your money for breakpoint it's garbage
Hamid Haroon you saying breakpoint is trash? How?
 @fire-du8jr  u played the beta
 @fire-du8jr  save your money on something big like cyber punk or last of us
 @fire-du8jr  I played the beta there were multiple bugs u can't play the game offline the story so far is mediocre and the gameplay has sorta changed but basically the same as wildlands.
Hamid Haroon yeah I did play it I did have some bugs it is true that it is dumb how you can’t play it offline and you right it does have similar gameplay as wildlands
 @fire-du8jr  highly recommend u to save your money on something else like last of us. Or if u want to buy it still get it for a lower price a game like this should be $39 for a lower price
Didn't age well 🤣
 @marcuskane1040  Bet he refunded it lmao
HAHA!!! This comment aged terribly
Ooof. . .This didn't age well.
Laughs in future
Lol
Oh. No.
So how did that turn out for you?
Oooffff how's cyberpunk treating you now?? Bigger disappoinment then anthem
Well….. shit
"its not a bug,
its a future Joe"
I totally disagree with you it isn't BioWare okay it's EA they want that company to sink you don't get that Angry Joe can you living down in the states I'm up here in Canada I live in Canada bio where is Canadian deep One games to fail so EA can shut down by where for good
Angry Joe I respect you as a video game the video game player and it was someone who a new Test games but you got to remember EA's trying to destroy BioWare I'm not trying to sound like a jerk I'm Canadian you'll buy where is Canadian but what yeah is trying to do is destroy BioWare get rid of it they bought BioWare and I don't know why my government allow that to happen that's why Anthem sucks
That thumbnail is how I feel about Cyberpunk
Why do all the awesome game companies have to fall from grace?!
Because greedy companies bring them down.
See the pinging in Apex annoys the fuck out of me. It's just constant audio that I don't want to hear. Go here...over there looks good...gun over here...stfu.
Your choices DO have consequences....just ask someone who bought Anthem.
😂
Well of course I know him he's my best friend likes EA games
"One thing I'd like to add that I never see anybody mention. When the game was announced they made it a whole bug deal about ""you have 4 javelins to choose from, level up and create your own javelin!"" But when you level up you get to choose from whatever javelin you want. There is no challenge or push to try and earn these javelins, they are just handed to you and it is extremely unsatisfying."
"I don't know... Getting to play with the Javelin I'm most interested in from the start is satisfying to me. If I had to get to end-game and grind for 20 hours just to unlock the one I really wanted to use in the first place, I would've been upset and probably wouldn't have bothered."
it sounds like the fyre festival of video games.
I'm calling it now. Joe's number 1 game in his Worst game/most disappointing games of 2019 list 👍
"Still 9 months for shitty games to come from Ubisoft, EA, Activision, and/or Bethesda lol"
"2 Words:
CALLED 
IT"
"Sorry, I don’t buy dumpster fire games and good job destroying the playerbase too lol.."
"I've never played the game, but going based of my experience with Destiny, I feel like the development of the game should have been solely focused on singleplayer, Co-op (either being story, strikes, or raids), and matchmaking (PvP, PvEvP) separately. ""Shared-world"" games are a cool idea, but something is obviously flawed in the way its executed. I would much rather have a dedicated campaign, co-op, and matchmaking like Halo instead of this shuffle through hub worlds and menus to try and figure out what I'm supposed to do."
If you want to put out a MVP then you start from a delivery pipeline and a Hello world! version. And then you push out a new increment every Scrum sprint or something.
Honestly it looks like they made part of the game and then decided to roll out this GAAS model in order for players to fund the rest of the time the game is in development. Like damn are times that bad that you have to prey on the gamers?
If you could even out the mics that would be great
Warframe + Destiny 1 & 2 + all of EA's shit = This terrible game.
Anthem is a loadings screen simulator.
I can't even play it. Midway through any mission I play will crash to desktop. 45 minutes in and I was having fun and I can't even finish the game. Anyone know a fix please let me know. Can't find a solution on google.
i love how joes tattoo loses its shit with the green screen
"BioWare, how is SWTOR a better game than this? As for crafting, no new game has done it  right. For some reason anytime the word multiplayer is used, devs think people don’t actually want to play the game together. Lol swtor you can go with your friends through almost every cut scene. So maybe BioWare can’t make a multiplayer.. guys I’m worried for  DA4."
🙁 I like anthem
Me too.
They’re trying to pull a No Man’s Sky
"Angry,
has there been any comeback or update on you'all suspicions that the game got chopped to shit as soon as EA came on board? What's the skinny, updatewise?  Cheers."
DCUO is the best looter shooter wym
These asshats told viewers that this game has a “single-player story” no the fuck it doesn’t.     You are joined by 3 ransoms who go in opposite directions and steal your thunder.
"I can buy this only because Bungie and Activision pissed me off. What started as a ""10 year game"" turned into a new full release. If they can actually do the 10 year model I will pay lower cost for new stuff. I sent so much on destiny and feel like ive done nothing."
"Think of it like this Joe, every game EA has released in the past 4 years has been a broken, buggy, greed driven demo mode (Battlefront 1 & 2, NFS Payback, anthem) and people CONTINUE TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. What incentive is there to improve when people will buy anything you release? Like an artist, who can paint any famous artwork, if you make just as much for a mimic of the Mona Lisa as you do a modern art piece (3 straight lines or a can of paint thrown around), would you continue making the Mona Lisa?"
this makes me wish apex wasn't from EA lol only game saving their real player base right now
Andromeda suffered for this shit.
The review didnt age well already BioWare is actually working hard on this game.
not really listen carefully what he said not with hatred because your fav game is being crapped on
"It's still got problems. Lack of content and crap drop rates. Aged just fine, nothing has really changed."
you still think that now man???? lmao
This comment aged poorly. The review aged great
"Admittedly I enjoy the game enough to keep playing it but it's missing just the loot and more cosmetics, more variety in the looks and effects of weapons and special weapons you can get from certain places with difficult enemies then just need more strong holds and some big raids to do and sorted it'll have a life"
I knew Anthem was going to suck and now I'm REALLY worried about the next Dragon Age! Thank you Joe and the rest of you guys for your time and telling the facts. Not being the die hard fan boys for these corporate thieves.
"Yeah noone have made a great looter shooter since Borderlands 2. Some have come close, some with even better gunplay (Destiny 2 and Anthem might be in this category), but they all fall flat on the loot aspect . Its too bad"
"Final Fantasy IV for the SNES that was made in 1991, in FFIV the weapons looked different and had different effects that displayed when you attacked.  It was a detail that really made me appreciate the game more and look for touches like that in later games.  But Anthem for the PS4, released in 2019, does not have a single Legendary that has a unique model?"
I would like to point out that black desert a 10$ has more to do then anthem a 60$ AAA game how in the fuck do all these free to play game with small teams like fortnight do more in 2 years then a big budget AAA team that's just fucking sad. thx eat for fucking another company.
Yknow what? I’m still gonna get this game.
Get fucked 😂😂😂😂
not all edge moments are worth it.
"I cannot blame EA or their studios anymore.
Because for years now everyone tells the same over and over again: don't buy EA games."
I have dream! AngryJoe or his 2 friends click like my comments!
Why does anyone even look forward to any game that's under EA anymore?
The great Kp ❤❤❤❤❤
WOT   a  giant ...  he  must be   6  ft   7    !
Is KP really that tall
Wow soo funny but true❤
He got his wish when Alex Carey ran out Johnny bairstow
What actually is happening..? Someone explain plssss
"Ah, Shup up Kevin. The real ashes cricket was when yall used to cheat, eh?
Go back you old uncle. Stop talking about cricket."
Bazball Ben stokes would rather entertain the masses than win a test match
"Is KP 6'5"" or the others 5'5""?"
This just popped on my fyp. Thought it was today against India 1st test. The England bowling line up are poor
"Clearly what we need is a South African-born player of silky shots and dazzling innings but also an infuriating penchant for getting out on 94 trying to bring up a century with a six, who still can't get over being dumped by England. Kevin, can you suggest anyone?"
CLASSIC KP 🌟
"'Bowlers running in at 70/80 mph...' They're in the wrong sport. We could be dominating world sprinting, instead of
coming second at cricket."
KP is fookin on point and damn correct
"Ipl bbl
😂😂❤"
"I'm glad Ollie Robinson is well out of the picture now. Soft, sloppy pudding of a man."
He have personal problem with england but what he said is true but bit a harsh on england Kp 😂😂😂😅
I like  Kevin spot on aussie
"Wait, why are two midgets interviewing KP?"
KP is the Gautam Gambhir Version of England.
"A year on, them poms refused to drink a few beers with australia in reply to their stupid wicket keeper for walking about outside his crease, what a bunch of pork chops cry babies"
Love this from KP
KP & Roy Keane same vibes
"Kp should on sky sports permanently instead of now and again, he speaks his mind unlike the rest, Ian ward is just a yes man for sky sports, time sky woke up and brought back gower , botham and Lloyd , we don’t want broad or ward or kumar, why is he on ffs"
Never thought Morgan is that short 😂
"Can’t get too friendly with the opponent can you Kev? That line was pure gold! 
Especially with the context of his situation, 
Sarcasm at it's best!"
What a feminine voice
You obviously haven't heard Buttler talk then 😂
 @reefbreaker9350  no not yet
I mean declaring at 390 has to be the most cocky decision in an Ashes series ever. It just smells of ignornace and overconfidence.
KP's clearly doing a bit. I'm here for it tho. Love it!
Dont make a South African mad.
Kp man ❤❤❤
After these words England draw the series😂😂😂
"Well said KP 😤😤!
Draw test match or loosing test match in home is crime !"
"An Englishman, Irishman and South African walk into a bar, which 2 played for England?"
"bigger question would be, which ones won them tournaments and cups 😂😂😂😂"
The English are to busy promoting the LGBTQP flag & getting sissified
Kevin is being The Roy Keane of cricket when it's needed
Well said KP!
"I mean pietersons point of 78,79,80 mph is invalid to begin with. Pietersen should know of McGrath at Lords in 2005, when conditions were suited to the bowlers, according to the English side! McGrath Reduced them to 21/5 and was only around the 80 flat MPH mark. Just felt like pointing out, Pietersen firstly goes from not much has caught my eye, straight to the negative of bowling only “80” mph”, which in itself is not actually the problem which I have justified why it isn’t above. Thought KP would be able to think more rationally and logically and not emotionally. Has really only criticised speed of bowling when it clearly in itself, doesn’t mean anything ,detrimental. Then says , this is not ashes cricket, well what is then? Bowling fast? Well McGrath who bowled around 80mph which you said was a justification for why  England has  been shambolic in the Present test, played the highest quality within the bowling attack?"
"There's a big difference between McGrath consistently pitching the perfect line and length at 80mph, getting the ball swinging this way and that, and Ollie Robinson plodding in banging it in short at 78-80 mph before dropping closer to 70 after a few overs. If you don't have almost perfect control then yes that kind of pace is a big problem."
Why is Kevin Pieterson  9 feet tall???😂😂😂
Ikr! the other two look like atleast 3 feet shorter man
"""Spirit of the game"" meets we're here to WIN.  KP would not have passed up on that Bairstow stumping opportunity."
This is rule of ICC.
"0:21 ""I've played 30 test matches against Australia"". I hate to nitpick here but KP, you have only played 27 tests against Aussies. 😄😄"
"KP this is modern sport. All sports have become too sissyfied imo. Boxing, football, cricket, basketball all of them."
"The Bairstow stumping occurred soon after this video was posted, and boy did things change."
Can someone explain this in basketball terms…?
"Meanwhile England fans: ""No! It's down to a legal run out during a match we were losing!"""
And a irishman😂😂
Hes south african😮
Brendon Mcullum would safely pack his bags and leave for auckland in some time.😊
"Australia , KP is spot on , in this one"
KP got his wish. Now literally both the nations are out for blood
KP is spot on.
Only if it wasn't coming from a man who sent text messages to the South African team on how to get Andrew Strauss out.
Well said.
Why is kp a gaint??
"THE MCC MAKE THE RULES!! THAT MEANS ENGLAND !! IN AN ASHES SERIES I WOULD USE ALL OF THEM TO GET THEM OUT!! WELL DONE AUSSIES!!!
YOU ATRE JUST A STONE COLD SOBER AGAIN!"
😭😭😭😭😭 England go you Aussies.
England has the same lax attitude as india. Both teams need a swift kick especially india to bring the back on track. Atleast eng gave a good fight.
KP being as supportive of England as he was when he played for them.
Thanks for your Harsh words i have seen this in India Pakistan match indian players are just having good day conversation with Rival team and after that they are like okay all is good that played better cricket won today 😂 what the heck man you should m not be gentle with enemy you can't win war with Good gestures 🤬
Kevin Pietersen channelling his inner Roy Keane
Look at the size of this guy. He’s a giant😂
"Pretty poor performances from England in both tests.. as I’ve said before, they believe their own hype. That style of play might be ok in limited overs but not in test cricket.. let’s face it, this is not a good Aussie side"
This is like watching Gandalf with the Hobbits 😂
"That is why Pietersen is no leader of men.Sure  as an individual but that kind of talk in a dressing room sends everyone against you irrespective. England did what they did they are what they are not what he  thinks they should be. Send him to a military academy and he would FAIL big time. He needs to learn man management.
RULE 1. Don't see the team as in your own image.  They will hate you for it."
The team plays like a pub team. Some of them need the treadmill.
"I know what you're all thinking, 
he's 193cm 6'4"
"But, but, but, Bazball"
This zen like bs ethos ‘ the outcome doesn’t matter’ England have taken on isn’t working
"I don't blame the poms. I would T want to get spanked by the Aussie's on home soil either.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Shut up man it’s a game of cricket🤦‍♂️ there’s a lot more important things in life
I can feel the pain KP is feeling today. England should have played a good cricket but they didn't.😏👎
When will England think that they need young bowlers because the older ones are not performing after winnings the toss and choosing to bowl in bowling friendly conditions they were not able to pick up wickets in first session. Australia should be at least five down in that session. So please leave our Anderson and Broad and get some fresh legs if you want to have a chance in this ashes.
Kevin’s rant feels pretty similar to that of Roy Keane haha
Karen Peterson
Sorry but why are the England players so pally with the Australians. They should be at their throats. Sorry but this is the Ashes
True this not ashes . This Ipl all friendly chit chat what’s dinner for tonight or what club we gonna go tonight???
When did Kevin become a giant ?
Aussies are cheats
Kp is spot on. When the test match is over then you can chat and be friendly.  We need those rivalry in cricket.  Remember  waugh vs ambrose 🔥.  Now it's to soft and boring
The way Broad was happily talking friendly to kawaja and warner was really terrible. And i say that as an Australian!
Not many South Africans are happy with England's wishy washy approach to the game. Well said Kevin🇿🇦😊
Bazball in the mud 😂
Jim Anderson should give rest
Woke cricket.
"What a mean man. So offensive. Doesn't he know that the English Cricket pronouns are ""brave"" and ""stunning""?"
Ar come on Kev turn it up mate tells what you really think & don't be sitting on the fence about it..
You won't see any indian expert or retired player criticize the team this openly which is a problem.
Not related but Big Ben is in London.
Kp always right
"They probably share the dressing room haha.
Give each other a nice massage."
Getting Roy Keane vibes from Kev
"So much for ""Baz Ball"" very entertaining but did it win the Test Match""?"
"Soo true, England getting bullied, showing no fight, no passion, no class. Come on, it's the Ashes Australia always show up. Home and away."
This 1 season joker talk s too much
It’s a bit hypocritical though…he played a few ridiculous shots in his time
"Ya i am also with pieterson i do not like how cricket is played now days , old days where aggression is every where but now everyone wants to be nice happy we or not ina function we are playing a game we do not loose the aggression but we Lost the soul of sport"
"Meanwhile... West Indies in CWC Qualifiers 🙄... Let's have Lloyd, Sir Viv, Holding, Marshall, Ambrose and Walsh on cam. We are already hearing the 1983 winning team veterans voice their opinion."
You hit the nail on the head KP...same attitude with Indian players too
"Losers, can't even handle a short ball 😂"
"Worst pundit going, can't stand his voice and makes everything about himself"
"Exactly what most fans are saying, this is a joke. What they going to do next, offer to wash their kit ? Man up for gods sake."
"Australian deserve their sucess, England gutless..Im ANGRY"
Well said KP.... England were absolutely pathetic...AMATEUR HOUR...DAMN JOKE!!
Hilarious that England put all their faith in a NZ coach🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well said KP .
"This was always going to be a tight series. If you give the opposition an inch, they will take a mile. Before you know it, you are down 2-0 in the series. I'm not a KP fan but he's spot on here. Come on Aussie Come on💪😁"
"Damn! That's some kinda hard word there!, That's why we love Ashes!"
can't agree more 🤜🏼🤛🏼
Kevin Petersen channels his inner Roy Keane.
The bowling is a huge problem now.  You can’t win Ashes cricket with three of your four seamers averaging around  80 mph.  Just doesn’t happen.
"Australia is certainly certainty yet to win.

But I will say (as an Australian) I've been extremely shocked at how England are playing Test cricket.

Let the best team win the series i guess!"
"Bazball needs a little tweak, at 188-1 with Lyon injured we should of been looking at 450/500 all out and a little lead, falling for the bouncer tactic was naive at best. Joe Root is far too classy and skillful to waste his wicket like that. Stokes is woefully out of form with bat and can't bowl  because of his knee. Pope and Duckett threw away centuries too. I am all for Bazball but let's tweak it a little to read the situation we're in."
"This is of course the same KP who routinely gave his wicket away unnecessarily whatever the match conditions were or the needs of his team happened to be, because he was playing his natural game. At his best a very good player. As a pundit hypocritical."
"Well I remember a very talented England batsman who was also rather prone to throwing away his wicket.  HIs explanation - "" Its the way I play!""  Can't think of his name right now  ...."
"The way the lad from Just Stop oil came in off stump 
oh hes talking about Cricket ...my bad"
i wonder is bazzball help bowler anyhow? they came back to bowling just like that. no proper rest for bowler in this bazzball thing.
Suck eggs KP!
Roy Keane of cricket KP 👊
"Shambolic? 🤔 Coming from big kev 😳, he was an expert in shambolic 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯"
I think you must consider that the Aussies have played well!
"It’s the Ashes I’d rather win than be entertained, just beating Australia would entertain me."
"Make KP captain, time to retire Ben Stokes......said no one ever."
Australia gives really hard fight because of which they are dominating England in England. Yes its a good thing to play positively but they dont have a back up plan when the other team goes hard.
"No wonder his team mates didn't like the guy, South Africa didn't want him playing for them either ."
I just want a similar rant from an Indian commentator on the complacency of Indian cricketers especially Rohit.
"""Can't get too friendly with the opposition""
Says the bloke who sent texts to the opposition dressing room on how to beat England"
The shambles is in the sneakers fellas.
"Have to stop playing Anderson and Broad together now, both slow now. Wasting a slot or 2 for the bowlers wood should be playing he Is fast. Lose this test and go 2-0 down series lost. There most be better spinners about than Ali, yes he got a few wickets but Alton’s not good enough. Also giving wickets away on a regular occurrence  in this test and the last one. No problem trying to score fast but sometime you have to stop flapping at every high ball and take stock. We should of been near 400, instead lose our las 6 wicket for 48 runs(I think) not good enough especially in a ashes series ."
Well Said kp
KP is angry.
"Spot on. Pathetic cricket by England. We started following Ashes after 2005 victory , what a series was that. The body language of English players are weak. Sorry mates."
Pietersen being too harsh at the england team. I think he should wait till the end of the game coz bazball will definetely turn things around.
"So much wayward bowling. Broad and anderson worst. No experience in their bowling. They are bowling to KG kids, not in ashes."
"First Test -Declared when they did RUBBISH -- THEN playing the rest of the game like a one day knock out. ???? Throwing wickets away dancing down the pitch, Who told Root 
to do that ?? YOU GIVE THE Australians   NOTHING --- They are Laughing at us -----They must think it's Christmas."
I never knew KP was 8ft.
"Aussies are performing really well as a unit, whereas England’s approach especially when it comes to batting is careless, to say the least. Bazball cannot be successful in every condition.
Anderson’s time is nigh. They need spark in the bowling. Bring in Mark Wood. Also, solidarity when it comes to batting. Otherwise this Ashes series will be all over very soon for England. Australia is already dominating the Lord’s test."
"Pietersen, you blerry legend, boat!"
He sounds like cricket's answer to Roy Keane 😂
KP looks about 8ft tall.
"Ashes getting boring day by day..as a cricket fan we waited for months for such a beautiful competition of game ...Bret le, flintof,Warne ,ponting kevin...ruthless to kill each other in ground that's the spirit we need"
Most of the cricket fans can't digest to see Aussie are playing good
Outplayed by Aussies they scored a the same rate as England in first innings without throwing their wickets away in the search to increase the run rate to 5 runs per over Crawley played great till threw wicket away same as Pope
"40 age players bowling at 70mph,expect to take wickets.Need to have young bowlers like flintoff to take 20 wickets."
"This rant was hilarious, KP sounds so different then you would think"
"The game has moved on since KP. One example is  that global leagues have brought sworn enemies into the same teams. The cricket is very competitive, just not as aggressive or mean as it used to be. I celebrate that."
"Yes, Ashes and Ind-Pak matches are not the same anymore as it used to be.. So casual, no aggression!!!"
Top notch well said
this is the same nicey nicey dressing room they wanted that got KP out the team... being nice doesnt win you nothing in no sports
KP lucky warnie not alive still. He cop a gob full
This is not Ashes ...this is a friendly  match ( Atleast for England)
Well well it's been a hammering session from KP. I doubtedly saw KP in such mode.. Ease out KP😊
To be fair shall we compare the results when KP was playing to the current team.
Fine them.
Spot on KP... btw archer and wood injured ?
Only archer injured
Shut up KP . Go England
Calm down big man. Enjoy the game before the grass ban comes in and the water runs dry or whatever the WEF do next to our government.
"KP, now I like you even more😅"
"Kevin is the roy keane of cricket,not afraid of calling out poor performances individually and collectively."
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
KP trying that Roy Keane talk
Yes Bazball doesn't mean you forget about any intent
KP showing the passion that england need
"Pampering of Anderson is unbelievable.He is visibly done & dusted.He done good for england in past (mostly in overcast condtions by the way 😄) But that doesn't mean he will play forever as per his wish,that too when he is currently hurting english chances. And what surprising is no1 is talking about hin but about stokes & their approach. I feel for stokes,he is drawing blame instead of Anderson."
This is rich coming from him 😂😂😂
"True. But just listening to Pietersen on the TV makes me want to switch off. Usually manages to make it about himself, or run down his commentary colleagues. What about wanting to ditch your team mates at Sydney eh Kev? KP great batsman. Terrible commentator and someone I would cross  the road to avoid."
Whats his problem? England won the first test... According to England anyway...
"""I may be wrong, I don’t think I'm wrong"" hahahaha"
He's certainly angry.. one can't miss that.
"True, some rivalry needs aggression. Because of IPL players don't know that actually they play for which team. 😂😂😂"
"He’s right, what the hell are they going, they don’t know how to play test cricket, that’s my conclusion."
In what way is Kevin Pietersen considered English?
Aus vs Eng is like Utd vs City 😂😂😂
Exactly 💯 percent true saying.  English Bloods getting ice cold Lately. Respect Kevin Pietersen.
I'm surprised anyone noticed Mr Figjam's rant as the reflex reaction when he appears is to mute the TV...
He had a point
Love KP 🏏
Kp awesome 👍
Superb line from Ward😂😂
Completely destroyed England team...!!!
"Alright Kev, you’re scaring me."
Go Kevin 👊
Can get too friendly with opponent Kev? Hahahahaha. Whole KP's rant got sayed by these words.
Avaraina telugu lo cheparaa
batting side is doing well for England on day 2
"KP started hitting Roy Keane mode. He was one step short of saying ""that's their job!"""
Cricket punditry’s answer to Roy Keane 😂
when it comes to sports England is SHAMBOLIC. Not just cricket mate. Lol
Always wondered why England are always producing 75-80 mph bowlers...Wood is an exception & Jofra came from barbados...but other than that can't remember anyone scaring the opposition with pace & aggression in the last 2 decades...
Nowadays in the name of sportsmanship the aggression and the eager to win a match is lacking in players and  they just casually play chilling out with opposition players
I liked it better when the top order from both teams were punching each other.
"Australia just showed to England,Bazball doesn't work against the Mighty Aussies."
KP had no friends in his own teams during his career...discuss ...
"Kevin: This is shambolic, why don't they just get out the mints like we did, shine that ball up and get it swinging like crazy and win the Ashes. When it comes out, that they cheated. they'll all get off Scott free like we did."
Don't sugar coat it KP. Tell us how you really feel.
"Are the two on the left extremely short, or is KP humungus?"
"Passionate Irish and South African poms, got to love it! 😂"
"Agree. Laughing and joking with the oppo in an Ashes test at Lords? We don't even do that in club cricket. We rock up, looking to be as ruthlessly efficient as possible. Intimidate. Close fields, eagerness. Don't talk to them, get in their heads. Seem nasty, seem rude. It all smells of Kumbaya cricket and it looks LAZY when you don't then bowl and act like you want to win. England should not be looking to win, they should be looking to DESTROY and use any and all tactics to do so. Robinson was swearing and showing passion at the end of the last test and he comes out and bowls 76pmh dibbly dobblers? No ways man."
"For all I didn't like KPs attitude as a player he is right here; you've got to bring out your big guns on the big day, and back up the chat with a bit of intensity in your performance"
Brilliant
Easy on the coke kev😂
"Day 2.  If I am Australia, I would declare now at 397/8."
sorry mate ipl made that environment to cricketers
"KP what do you think ashes cricket is ?? guns bullets and bombs ,, its a game mate ,, play hard to win not to kill ,,"
He's a big lad ain't he
"This type of commentry should be there in India too, instead of sucking each player like they are some kind of God."
It’s disgrace out there laughing and joking with the enemy like it’s not the ashes like there not getting battered at the Home of English cricket stokes the captain suppose be the leader tf is he doing you are out there to take there heads off the 2009 squad woundnt have been laughing and joking there be putting the fear of god in them rough them up !!! This is the problem with England football team to Nice !!!! Get out there rough them up
Who are the hobbits?..🤔
Everyone has different approach Kp is just trying to show up with his mouth
Man that was some angry rant by KP🙄
He declared at 390 because he has too much pride.
"i completely agree with kp's take however, massively hypocritical. if anyone watched his documentary  being kevin pieterson he talks about the incidents leading upto text gate. the main one was him being best mates with the south africans on the field and strauss not liking it...Also his reasoning defending it was he was mates with them from the ipl? It cant just be terrible when its not you doing it kev..."
"I am not am England fan or even a real cricket follower, but I watched all day at an inept England side out of their depth. Big Kevin could have got more scathing if he were not on TV"
Full Keano by Kev there!
What is the problem? I don't watch cricket
Cool South African accent.
No Kevin being friendly is not a problem or a bad thing it's just England bowling attack needs a complete change like England batters more attacking
In history of ashes its normal to get beat
Well said KP ! this is the Ashes.  Australians are the most competitive nation in the world and you can see it their demeanor.  Lets play like it means something to the fans and players of this historical contest !!
Rubbish. It's the same players who just think they're irreplaceable! Hopefully as soon as Wood is fit we'll see changes....and why is Woakes not getting a game??
He is speaking FACTS and on point 💯💯💯
What do you expect!! Pope dropped a sitter.. should be dropped..
"Baz said England are going to go even harder. In what way are England ""going harder"" than getting smacked to the boundary?"
England wearing Rainbow Underpants !!!!
KP has more passion in his voice than the entire England team.
Pietersen is bang  on in what he says.
He’s not wrong baseball is all well and good but great sides adapt that declaration at Birmingham was daft and they know it! all this chirping in the press will have no effect on the Aussies they will laugh at them let’s see what they’ve got day 2 eh?
Spot on KP.
need more of this in cricket
"Stokes is not captain material. I don't know who is, but it's not him.
They need to start developing seriously quick bowlers. Australia churn them out but England can't."
I know KP is 6 foot 4 but he looks huge here!
Can 77year old Anderbroad perform for 5 tests?
Thanks KP and English team to introduce me to a new word. Never heard ‘shambolic’ to be honest. No shame to accept it 😅
They showed more willingness against the JSO protesters lol
This day one is similar to the day one of the world test championship final where australia lost the toss and sent into bat and still ended up on top at the end of the day on difficult pitches both in london because of some poor bowling by both the teams that won the toss
To b honest eng bowling attack cant be enough to destroy aus batting line up was extra ordinary specially smith he is a champion player..
mark wood for ollie robbinson
"I thought batring first, Australia will be bowled under 200."
Declaring in the last match was arrogance pure arrogance...
How could you drop mark wood ...mark wood should have been in to the side ...
"i think they are dearly missing Archer, Wood => i do not why they arent playing Wood is he injured or waiting for 2-0.... i think Tongue balled good, Broad ok, Anderson till now a bad series, Robinson is an absolutely moody bowler, Stokes is just bowling with will power.... unfortunate conditions...."
"Anderson looking old, Robinson very ordinary,stokes bowled like me, rubbish!! Aussies gonna get 600!! 😥"
I am searching to click ❤ instead of 👍🏻 after hearing KP. Well said Kev❤❤❤
"Kev's right. As a fan of English cricket, I'm glad that someone is talking about and making no bones about it ( I only wish he had avoided getting himself in too much when speaking - 'I've played 30 tests, I did this, I did that ), but he's got the rest of the comments spot on. I was miffed to see Baz and Stokes all smiles and shaking hands after the Wellington defeat in February, inexplicable after a defeat. It all felt too chummy - being unfazed after defeat is one, but being smiles all around ?! Even in the first test a couple of weeks ago, I hardly saw anyone wincing when defeat was near ( except perhaps Broad ). The bowling department ( both spin and pace ) needs an overhaul with sufficient bench strength - only Broad looked like someone that could take a wicket in the first test. The second test isn't turning out to be any different, although I hope for a very different result from the first. Can we have Wood for the next test please?"
"Bloody hell Kev, just because no one on the field liked you doesn't mean it has to be the same for everyone else."
England missed someone like Mark wood. He was such a fierce bowler even in spin friendly pitches in India
"Better for KP to get stuck in after Day 1. Still time for England to knuckle down and get a big innings as well, Bazball style or not and then see what happens"
Can we expect this kind of reaction from indian broadcasting team when india is playing.
Agreed
👏👏👏
Just praised and paid too much.
You will be made to eat your words
"Damn, KP is bloody tall."
This is ⚱️? Where is the agression? This is not the game we grew up watching.
"I’m a proudly Proteas supporter🇿🇦 however I would say Aussies are on top of their game, well solid team doing well"
"the way auzzies dominated after losing the toss, they are bossing"
Well done KP
Just take the knee before and after stopping for lunch and everything will be fine.
"Just compare!

Openers to Openers - Eng have 'ride on luck openers'. Enough said.

3 - Marnus well above Pope.

4 - The only equal comparison.

All rounder - The fittest and agile guy who bowls 140+ and takes blinders at gully. Eng have a limping superstar.

Keeper - Tidy vs Hopeful

Spinner - One of the best vs null

New ball bowlers - Work horses who can continuously bowl tight lines all day long. Eng have veterans sweating and clearly past their prime.

First change bowler: Eng have a guy who bowls slower than Shahid Afridi.

So, on paper, off paper it's clearly AUS who is monstrously stronger than ENG.

It's just the sheer confidence and Bazball that got them close in 1st test.

If not for it, they would have been blown away by an innings."
They have weak bowling line up
"Maybe the ECB report on english cricket culture is playing on the minds of the english team and they dont want to be seen as arrogant and overly confident,  which in my opinion are 2 qualities you need to win an ashes series"
nice one karen pietersen
"This is what happens when woke effects sports, safe spaces and no hurt feelies."
Already lost the Ashes
"KP feeling the passion and has the skills to back it up, unlike the English team."
Where is funky Archer and woood
Completly coreect good lad kp
"Perhaps some credit needs to go to the Australians who batted superbly most of the day, while I agree, England could and should have done better. But its not all doom and gloom, four days still to go, anything can happen"
hahahahhahhahahahahahhaahhahahha
Since the declaration the writing was on the wall we got to cocky
Apart from the usual 2....the rest of the bowling attack is village standard !.......In fact there is probably better bowlers playing village cricket unfortunately cricket doesn't have the same scouting procedure as football !
If slip fielders will drop catches like yesterday then it will give chances to the batsmen to hit
ipl.blame millions earned no one cares ashes
Well said kp
Man Kevin Pieterson makes those other 2 guys look like teenagers
Silent killer Ian Ward owned KP at 1:47..😂😂😂
"OK, let's put aside the 1st test declaration. I would rank it maybe 5th most significant contributor to the result. No. 1 Poor fielding, No. 2 Inability to sustain pressure, No.3 Weak top 3 batters, No. 4 Injury to English spinner..."
Where are all the bowlers in the English setup? We are still turning to a couple of 40 year olds. We haven't got the attack attack to compete. As that report that come out pointed out. The English cricket team have a shallow pool of private educated boys to pick from. That system does not create street fighters. They have had it too easy all their lives. Rant over.
He’s absolutely spot on!!
"Two worst sports in the World. First Cricket, second Baseball."
"first good thing KP has said. be more like ponting, brutal but honest. it gets respect, andd your bloody spot on, well played kevin."
I don't think its the bowlers mistake. It is the Australian batting which has improved a lot
Improved? Aussies won the WTC after being the best team for 24 months it’s just the norm
By playing both Broad and Anderson they are loosing a bowler and on top no genuine spinner. Eng loosing this Test. Its time Eng land should play either Broad or Anderson and start giving chances to other bowlers.
"It is crazy , if you compete in sport you want to win end of !! Needs a tweek in attitude."
Follow on from England after Lyon takes 8
4-0 Australia with a draw thrown in
I'm an Aussie and don't know these bowlers. Was bowling at 78 a tactic or is that the fastest the bowler can go?
After 2005 ashes England have won just one series 😂
The KP rant was brilliant but I was expecting the nasser rant which can be very lethal and I'm hoping hear from him today before or after the game
"Completely with KP. Conditions best suited Anderson and Robinson, why weren't they champing at the bit to get out there and make Warner and Kwaja uncomfortable with the moving ball.
The bowling attack looks good on paper, but needed some sting. Tongue bowling 90mph would have been a start."
In first match English bowlers crying for flat pitch what happens now 😂
Bazzball basics breaking down the opposition again….
So funny 😂😂  Peterson so  funny lol 😂😂 Gatting wouldn't be talking or laughing at Shane Warne bowling LoL 😂
Thats exactly what happened to India. Umesh Yadav the person known for raw pace gets a chance to be in the team bowls 81mph. What? Shardul Thakur great batting skills but again 79 mph isn't picking anyone up unless the ball is moving like a snake....
"KP IS RIGHT 
ENGLAND LOOK OUT OF PLACE

There bowlers think that there batting will win them the game
But they will loose this test in a much bigger way then the 1st test..
Just look at how Australia played in Australia and how england is playing in English conditions...

Same bowlers nothing out of the box thinking
And stokes says that he wants test cricket to reign"
"Its probably a reflection on modern day society, everything has to be nicey nice nobody can do anything which could slightly offend someone. FFS its ENG VS AUS ON our patch get into them 😡👊🏻"
"well said Kev,that isn't rivalry Im seeing..too friendly by far"
"Broad and Anderson, you have been great for England, some of the best to ever played, but u need to retire. Expired and too predictable. We need some young fresh tall quick bouncy pacers who can bat."
Into it KP!!!! well said mate 👍
He is so tall 😮
Op kevin
England have to be friendly and inclusive. Apparently this includes Australians.
"Ive said this for years and would like to see a stat on it, Stuart Broad takes wickets in his first 8-10 overs , after that hes useless. And i said this before the the series started, its going to be an uphill battle for this bowling attack to get Australia out twice in any test match. After seeing this today, it reinforces that opinion."
Spot on KP
I'm agree with Peterson 😁🥴🥴
He is right.
"Kp is absolutely right ,agree with ur statement😮"
"If some commentator on star sports   
had done this BCCI would have taken some non sense action against him.
I love this from KP. Gives us some different perspectives.
Broadcasting Levels of Sky are much better than Star Sports."
"No one cares about Cricket apart from about 8 people. Its not even a sport. I mean name me another ""sport"" where you break for tea and cakes? 

No one cares."
England declaration at first innings was the major turning point of the first test match and more importantly the position England declared. They decided to declare while Joe Root was still batting. If not declared England first innings score will be somewhat around 450 . That's the main question KP was pointing out .
We need KP as a commentator in cricket 24 game 😃✌️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would also go for shambolic. Broad and Stokes aren’t taking this situation seriously. There’s no Bazball and the bowling has no aggression whatsoever. I agree with KP as would Boycott. Scrap the hundred.
Kevin Peterson channeling his inner roy keane 😂
Ian ward 1:48 😂😂😂😂
KP as always OP ❤🔥🔥
KP & GG displays lot of guts to smack thy teams
Respect for KP... Make him England head coach
IPL effect 🥳🥳😂😂😂
Can anyone imagine an Indian veteran speaking like this about India? lol
They are playing with four dibbly dobblers and one part time spinner. Beyond shambolic.
Kp is one of the best england I've seen respect big man should be playing today would smash the ausie bowlers around the part like nothing.
"Yeah I mean entertainment is not the only purpose. They keep telling that the reason is to entertain the crowd. But if they win like they did in the past 12 months, that itself will fill the stands with supporters."
Kp is on the ball dnt like how england look how today.
Bro is always angry for no reason
Rehan Ahmed should play. They need a expert spinner man. Joe root is not a spinner 🤣
Rehan only 18. He doesn't have experiences to play against mighty aus
 @RajPlaysFTF  I know. But England does not have other option. Lets give him a chance.
 @passionpodcast6131  right he deserve to next match
Kevin looks like  a giant😂
Exectly
Good on you KP
Kevin Pietersen right there
Australia want to win -England want to be paid !!!
Need to improve their over rate then. Not going to get paid if that doesn't improve also.
Mc cullum thinks this is IPL 😂
Australia will win 3-1 or 4-0 or 4-1
"Test matches are seriously getting too much friendly these days.
Bring back Sledging"
"Bring back virat with captaincy 
 maybe work"
"Aus is not stupid like Eng to declare on 393/8 on day 1. 

Only Eng can do such stupidness. They have done that twice and lost the match."
They need young bowlers
Kp  being roy Keane of cricket
"If you get too agressive with AUS, they might whip out the sandpaper again"
Blame the IPL for the nice gestures and warm greetings! Its making cricket and  players SOFT
where is mark wood he deserve to play😎😎
Being from India I will also be very angry 😡 if our boys chit chat during any match vs Pakistan when you play ...you play for the nation you are not there to make friends outside the field you can have a dinner lunch I don't have any probs . That is missing in today's set of player's..
"Starc Hazlewood and Cummins are all capable bowling 90mph , Anderson broad and floginson can’t bowl 90k. Joe root bowled a faster bouncer than Robinson 😂"
Bazball doesnt work against seasoned teams like Australia.
KP is an acquired taste in the commentary box but he is spot on here.
England is definitely going to lose the ashes on their Home pitch after 18 years.
Ollie Robinson finish bowler but dude should back himself up with performance not overly aggressive comments
Day one of test 2 and Pieterson is already turning on his own hahaha.  Love it.
"KP IS absolutely right. There was no friction, no heat, no animosity. Doesn't feel like the Ashes"
this is why we love KP
"England had such a great oppurtunity. They won the toss, there were bowling conditions awesome for the England bowlers but thet could not avail. Well said Kevin!"
"Australia played some orthodox test cricket meanwhile england going extra aggressive from the word 'go"". They lost wickets in process."
"Yes, there should be a more intense rivalry before the game, but give it a break, Kev.
Broad, Anderson and Tongue bowled very well. In the first 25 overs Broad and Anderson beat the bat fifty times without luck."
"absolutely agree with KP, these are freaking international matches not friendly matches. No one wants you to pull & punch but at-least have the attitude of not letting the other team win at any cost."
"Kp and Eoin morgan knows their stuff because they used to play for england before and love their opinions! Love it when they say that england had a lot to say win by 150 runs or have australia in the backseat good hype for the ashes but england have to back it up. Let me put it this way, england is all talk but no action"
"Wise words from former ""England"" greats in Kevin and Eoin

Go raid other countries programs. That's all ECB have ever done

Once a coloniser, always a coloniser"
England suck
"Kp has waited a long time for this opportunity to run England down, when you win you’re great ,when you lose shambolic ,really!!
Get him off the coverage please!!!!"
I feel Stokes captaincy is to be blamed here.CONSTANT BOWLING CHANGES AND AVERAGE FIELD PLACEMENT DIDNT HELP THE CAUSE. I FEEL ROOT SHOULD HAVE BOWLED MANY MORE OVERS IN BETWEEN THE SPELL OF PACERS. IN THE FIRST TEST ALSO STOKES CONTINUED TO GIVE THE BOWL TOMOEEN ALI AND IGNORING JOE ROOT IN BETWEEN EVEN HE WAS GOING FOR MANY RUNS. ENGLAND NEED TO PRIORITZE IN NOT LEAKING RUNS
Australia showing England what is called cricket. This is what happens when you make someone coach who has not won any cup in his life. McCullum's strategy works against a weak minded opposition but Aussies are anything but weak minded.
Starc will eat them with aggression
90 percent comments in this video are of india. Shows how Indians have time to invest in other countries cricket 🤣🤣
Slow swing bowlers no aggression
"The reality is the English just aren't on the level of Australia and apart for about 3 series haven't been for 35 years. Even the rare times they beat Australia, it's no convincing, where Australia consistently destroy them."
England missing wood and jofra
"Damn, he is angry and on point with the criticism..."
Well Said Absolute Facts
KP is right
Club cricket caused this .
Ashes is war in cricket
"Hahhaha. 6 days ago they loved the declaration. Maybe, just maybe, this england team isn’t the one to prove 130 years of test cricket wrong 😂😂 but nah, they’re changing the game. Maybe they just need to do a few more ramp shots. That ought to do it 😂"
"Had England won in Edgbaston, nobody would be talking. But they didn't. 
Amazing how victory and defeat can change the mindset of teams. Roles have completely reversed from last test. England will need to find someone to inspire them when they bat like Khawaja did for Australia in the last game. 
Let's wait four more days for further ranting."
Bazball power failure 😂😂😂
Jimmy Clouderson was unlucky....Pope dropped the slip catch.  No Pope for the next match.
Kevin Peterson is the cheater and MATCH FIXER so why ENGLISH MEDIA AND ENGLISH CRICKET BOARD GIVEN THIS IMPORTANCE
I didn't realise the bloke was so tall !
Can he just go away please? Like anywhere? Why is a South African even commenting on this..... he could bat but he is no commentator
"England seem to be afraid batting first. They might have feared of first test result, batting first."
If they carry on like this Glen McGrath's prediction may finally come true. They should think of us pommes living in Oz because it's torture watching this....
"I mean why tf is Anderson and Broad still the heading the pace attack, they’ve been great but it’s time to get some new blood in….."
KP is the symbol of straight forward
Best part about english cricket is that even there owm commentators don't hesitate to point out short comings in their own team or team selector which is great there has to be positive criticism for betterment of sports
"Typical. Piertesen's POV reflects South Africa style, where spectators and players turn the game into a hate fest.  
It's great to see the Ashes teams on good terms. It's good for the human spirit. You don't need to animosity to be competitive."
"For David Saker to get off his (ample) backside (seated at left 0:29) and do what Mr Pietersen suggests would require Mr Saker to think, to make compound sentences, and to stand up for a few minutes while doing the ""speech""...Mr Saker can do none of these things...English cricket officialdom must fire him before he spoils this team."
i wonder how tall is KP?He looks giant infront of them?
Bunch of English Sassy girls
No English bowler would get into the Australian & South African bowling attacks
"Bunch of pie-chuckers 😂

“Bazball” doesn’t take the bowlers into account."
"England will be lucky to score 270 if Aus get to bowl in similar conditions. 
Looking at my crystal ball I am going to predict that Aus win by 150."
"Well said Kevin. 👏 This is what I wannna see in the Ashes, the fire, the passion, the grit, the banter. . .needs to be a warzone."
"Can never understand all the nicety during any sport. Yeah be the best of mates after or building up to matches. But not on the day, you want has many edges you can create in a match. Then when it's over do all this lovey dovey stuff..."
@cyrilstheone  exactly. I had a basketball game against my old school once and one of my old friends refused to talk to me until the game was over. That's how it should be.
"Well said Kevin, this is not d way to play test cricket the way England r playing.  Bazball will not win u test every time."
Good point about declaration. Not enough has been made about the idiocy of declaring in your first innings. Another 30 runs could have changed the game.
And he didn't touch on the complete unprofessionalism in the extras count and dropped catches. English players should worry more about getting the basics right than talking rubbish.
A typical KP as always speaking on point with no sugar coating. 😂
"he's just upset that they're enjoying themselves and he isn't. Keep it up, England team!"
KP taking a leaf out of Roy Keane's book!
"Just ask anyone who played with Allen Border about Ashes cricket , he wasnt called catain grumpy for no reason"
Seems end to Bazball
"Head and green give their own wicket, otherwise it is very bad for them."
"dude KP, all those Englishman on the pitch are getting so old, so their ego maybe subside, of course their ego is gone and become friendlier"
Can someone talk on the same terms for India team?
Gavaskar does sometimes
"England need some real quick bowlers. You can't get swinging condition everytime. That's where Australia are always ahead against any opponents.if you go with all medium pacer with 130kmh,you will not get the result what you want."
"HEAD showed them true BAZBALL😂😂😂
Outspoken FIRANGIS!! 
WELL DONE HEAD!!"
If England lose this test batting recklessly then the English media and ex players gonna go bashing the Bazball tactics ......
First get out of the bazball theory it won’t work
"As an Eng fan, it’s frustrating to watch… It felt like Aus were just warming up in the 1st test and they still won a game Eng should’ve won. Now they mean business, you can see how much they want to win having not won here for 22 years. Good old hard-nosed Aussie cricket. 
I don’t even know what this Bazball is, but it needs to evolve somehow into a smarter approach. Unfortunately, it may take a home Ashes defeat to bring that about. By all accounts, Stokes is super competitive and hates losing, so I’d love to know what’s going on in his head right now. He must know that a bad 1st session tomorrow and this game has gone. 
I feel KP’s frustration!
Arguably only Root would get into a combined XI of these 2 teams."
It’s Australia’s ashes to lose now
England can not win with 125kms bowling attack which lack penetration .....
"It’s nothing to do with being friendly, they’re just not good enough. How can a 40 year old and a 36 year old be within the best 4 bowlers in your entire country?"
I think England are a bit rattled despite the 1-0 lead they've taken into this match
But test cricket is still interesting when it comes to England and Australia. Its for the cricket fans unlike india that still don't know how to play test cricket.
So Baz ball cricket is all hoax.
Pieterson has problems. It's just a game. So what if the players are chummy with each other?
LOL! doesnt this just sum up the English mentality. When things get tough they turn into massive cry babies.
I feel like i'm watching Simon Cowell with an accent
Great criticism! Hopefully England will feel both - guilt for today and motivation for day2
Bazball is going very well
Ahmed is playing. Just give him the ball. Let him have a bowl. This will be a 5-0 thrashing. Drop Broad and Anderson ffs and get some youth in. These two are getting smacked all over.
Just noticed this interview was at tea- there was a lot more dross to come after this lol
Ipl is to blame for this friendliness. The game has lost its spice 😞
"I think KP was spot on in his summing up, but perhaps the England team isn't good enough."
"Yes and no KP - yes England's body language, overall performance etc came off as underdone, but it's supposed to be a gentleman's game (and YES, before it begins I know Aust have broken rules of conduct and such plenty of times before, I can still hold onto my view of the spirit the game should be played in) so we don't need argie-bargie and such from both sides"
Im a big fan of the way england played..keep up the good work🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Yes and no. There’s playing hard and there’s rudeness. You still can talk to the oppo. The declaration was brave. If they’d taken those last two wickets you’d still be applauding it today.
Good to hear Australia is doing good then
"Today's Ashes test comes with the added bonus of annoying the crap out of Kevin Pietersen. Interestingly they did manage to get an actual Englishman into this little commentary trio, that's nice."
"That ashes squad of 2005-06 Vaughan, Pietersen, Flintoff, Jones, Harminson really tough against that mighty australia"
“I’m not here to make any friends; I’m here to win the ashes”
Ive said this on every Facebook post ive seen .....this English team does not know the true significance and the gravy of the Ashes ... You rather die to draw than give the opposition a sniff at winning ... ... Its just shameful shameful how lightly England has taken the Ashes ...but oh well... Aussie Aussie Aussie 👍👍
Ye Buddha bhut bholta hai😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
lol🤣
England is just a mediocre side ! Just like India living on the hype !
Bazball getting a reality check. Against quality sides it'll be found wanting.
"One dimensional England pace attack is not helping them
They need someone like Mark Wood or a left arm pacer or a genuine off break or slow left arm bowler, if stokes is playing only as a batsman then make way for other"
"Did the same mistake with NZ and lost by 1 run, confidence is ok over confidence is not. Who will declare on 1st day when your top bat is 120+ to have just 4 overs mad. Easy win gave it away."
Bazball? More like Spazball lol
i love it
Aussie bowlers gonna rip England apart
Why does KP look like he's about 7 ft 11?
Steve Smith = Batsman + Talented + Captain + Classic + Stroke / Hitting + Motivate + Inspiration + Gem Of A Player 💥💯💛
The Australian batsman are way too confident. England have to make some serious bowling changes or they're toast.
"Absolutely disappointing. Didn't expect that from England, hope they'll come back stronger on day 2"
I doubt it and I see Australia getting at least 425 or 450 in the first innings
 @richardmartins1541  let's hope for the best
 @royalgamer2352  nope
 @richardmartins1541  are you Australian?
 @royalgamer2352  and the issue is where I'm from or not 🧐🤔
Kevin Pietersen is the Roy Keane of cricket
B b but Bazball is reinventing the game 😂
Australia aren't winning this series... England are losing it! There is a difference!
Whatever happened to bazball?????? LOL
Eoin Morgan has an accent for every occasion!
Poor performance by England. Australia will win this series
Waaaay to friendly and JB carrying that dude off was village.
""" Keep your mates close, but keep your enemies closer,"" I feel for all the spectators who paid their hard earned money on a lackadaisical performance."
KP was blowing smoke in unpleasant places day 3 of the first test. Now he's having a rant. Short lived love affair with bazball mate. Not surprised at all as KP was never that good at staying loyal to the team if it didn't suit his ego.
"Love or hate KP, he’s totally right on this occasion"
Can we hear what Ollie Robinson has got to say now please?
78mph bowlers and rubbish bowling. Looked very casual.
KP is fiiiired up
"From an Aussie point of view, this is hilarious it's only day 1 of the second test and Pietersen is already blowing up, imagine what he'll be like on the 3rd or 4th day of this test let alone the rest of the series."
"Roy Keane cricket version lol

Sky surely cracked the formula to get more views lmao you'll be watching this kind of rants throughout the summer on this channel lmao"
Well said big boy
"Hey everyone wanna hear a cricket joke???

ENGLAND!!"
"Kevin is spot on , have a beer together after the test match but during the game no nicities at all !!!"
How anyone can stand listening to that voice for any period of time is beyond me. Nails on a blackboard.
Edgbaston day one will haunt us on this tour....
"Bazball makes your team be like the Harlem Globetrotters but as what was said, they need to have superior skills, like the Globetrotters, to win."
Does cricket means just entertaining nowadays wheres old rivalry gone.
It's gone long ago when professional word entered in the game.... Nowadays it's just money that matters nothing else and that's sad reality.
"As an Aussie living in London, I just want to say- brits, keep on keeping on ladssssss"
"It's rubbish that the ball didn't do as much as it should have done. Those balls that got Warner and Khawaja were almost unplayable. It was very tough conditions to bat in early, Eng are very lucky to have won both tosses. But it's not going to help if you have 78mph bowlers trundling in against international quality batsmen like it's a county benefit game"
The ball was pitched on good length..no drive ball was given..how can you expect good length balls to swing miles..make them to drive
Gee. It doesn't take long for the English supporters to turn on their team. It is only day 1. Long way to go. The Aussies are a very good team. England will need to play at their best if they stand a chance.
SO TRUE I PREDICT A 5-0 WHITEWASH IN FAVOUR OF AUSTRALIA
Don't worry it'll be a moral victory for England because they'll have a higher run rate.....
There was a great book written a few years ago called “Never a gentleman’s game”.    This English team needs to read it.
"Absolutely bloody awful performance, We are playing one day cricket in a test matches, should have won first test, but blew it through lack of patience and poor shot play.
Today we looked like we only had to turn up to win, mental attitude was dreadful. I can see us getting whitewashed in this series"
Bring him back!
"McGrath also raises the same issue few years back.
Now a days players are too nice to each other ,they have no sense of competitiveness between them."
"England ,too much talk not enough action to back it up."
Meh... it's all still about KP though. Always is.
0:45 very true
Aussie Aussie Aussie
KP and two dwarves live from Lords
Think there was enough movement in the first session but the English bowlers were a fraction too short. You can afford to make simple mistakes like that in your home conditions.
England is rubbish!
Lucky root got those quick 2 wickets... but day 1 honors are definitely with Australia
This is why pakistan India is the biggest rivalry in cricket
That pitch will be a nest of vipers when starc Cummins and co get on it.
Spazball destroyed Australia in the first test and now leaves the poor Aussies totally demoralised on this green top. Also too much T20 cricket has made the players too familiar with each other. No real rivalries any more.
Watching last night. It felt like Australia is playing in Australia on this wicket. Aus definitely on top.
Meanwhile Indian media licking the boots of rohit and virat for more trps and their stupid army defending them against everyone who asks questions. pathetic Indian toxic fanbass
Come from original ID Abdul.
I was very disappointed with England today. KP is spot on- very poor showing by England.
Real talk… and how tall is KP?
Well that was embarrassing for England. England are years behind in the game of cricket!!
All day over pitch bowling and they managed to hit quite easy 41 boundaries
"Yep, and now that Australia have turned  them over, the real kicking will start."
"As an Australian, it's always heart warming to see KP carry on like a pork chop."
Whenever he appears on screen generally
It's all he knows
"I remember him in a Test match against Sri Lanka in England. The home team was dominating. He tried to get on top of their spinner. Hit a couple of sixes early in the over then tried another and was caught. England's batting then collapsed and ended up losing  the Test match. 
His ego took over, instead of playing the team game."
​ @blueycarlton Lol ..KP was unfortunate to play for England. He could undoubtedly be among the legends of the game.
" @Airops-td4qs  isn't he among the legends of the game? i would say he played in an era where there were some of the biggest and best we've ever seen, and he was right up there with them"
"KP scored over 8000 test runs, 23 centuries. England would not have won the 2005 ashes without him. Not bad for a pork chop."
He's spot on tho mate
I reckon the Father Time windvane at Lords must have been modelled on KP...turns quickly depending on the wind direction.
Carry on like a Pork chop is an underused phrase
He saw a camera pointed at him & couldn’t help himself
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
​ @Airops-td4qs unfortunate? He chose to play for England.
​ @MartensAD oh he could play but he is and always will be a pork chop
" @MartensAD  so what ? stats don't make you any less a d1ckhead, and KP is a world class d1ckhead"
" @blueycarlton Funny how you blame KP for hitting sixes and getting out, ignoring the fact that as you yourself describe, the entire batting around him collapsed. 

Maybe he knew how bad the batting around him was and realized that he had to score quickly if they had to have a chance which led to him attempting sixes instead of playing a safer defensive game that may have led to him improving his batting average as he remained not out as everyone else was dismissed but a worse outcome for the team."
" @hellojake7684 
All l he had to do was to stay in and accumulate runs. Not play like a show pony.
He cost England that Test. 
Still, I suppose that happens when you don't develop home grown talent and rely on pilfering players from other test playing countries."
Has he got a book coming  out?
The worst ‘sport’ in the world
"This is not ashes cricket....
Well this kinda was ashes cricket pre 2005 (1989-2005)..."
"Ollie Robinson giving it the bigun bowling 79mph. England better start looking for some decent skillful fast bowlers, because the Anderson and Broad show isn't gonna last for too much longer, and wood and archer are obviously not long term options."
"I think they should abolish the ashes and just play regular tests against other teams. The whole thing is so played out. And I think KP is asking for aggression that’s not really possible now, since they all play together in T20 leagues and so on. And I would rather see friendship and respect between the teams. I don’t need this ridiculous rivalry in 2023 when there’s so much more important stuff to be thinking about, like having a future on this planet.

And on that subject, Bairstow carrying off the JSO protester showed me how little these people care about climate change, even though cricket is in imminent danger of being impossible to play in countries like India and Australia because of extreme heat and humidity."
Brendon McCullum should be removed 💀💀
This was just comedy from KP. Can’t take him seriously trying to do a rant.
"The difference between 2005 and 2023 is that players in 2005 weren’t playing together for BBL, IPL and other T20 comps, which meant you made friends from other countries, I can’t see much changing Kev, I get the frustration, but everyone is far too friendly these days, all they do now is rubbish hype talk"
Ward done KP dirty with that one! 😂😂
England more concerned with pronouns for the game title than how they/that/theer/zear actually play. smh
"Good to see the Poms abandoning this whole ""entertaining is better than winning"" cop out they've maintained for the last week and a bit"
I really could not care what KP has to say really
For a test that if England doesn't win they are in big trouble. It looked like a 4th grade attitude
KP is like the Roy Keane of Sky Sports Cricket 😂
No he isn't the guy is an idiot
"I mean Kevin is a go getter but also these are times when players are more friendly since they play together a lot. Maybe ashes is not always about cursing and sledging, but also don’t mean that u let your guard down. This English team is definitely better than his ashes team for sure, it’s just hunger isn’t there."
So its pointless.
England have stocked their team with a bunch of trundlers. They are flat track bullies who lack any confidence in picking 20 wickets. Can't imagine how you justify playing 2 40 year olds together.
Wonder what will happen to bazball now …..after england go down 2-0 after this test. Are we entertained?
Lol KP is just talking crap as he mostly does. Murder at 1:45 😅
How does Kevin keep his balance with those tiny feet?😳
Giant of a man
"Two words: David Saker (seated at left 0:29). I am Australian, and I can tell you he's the problem. Get rid of him immediately. Mr Pietersen is right on."
Nowadays Sports all around is 👙👙👙👠👠👠💄💄💄👄👄👄💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿. Done watching this rubbish. Maybe a 2 minutes clip.👍🏽
Totally agree 👍👍👍
What height is Petersen he looks like a giant
1:48 ripped him to pieces right there 😂😂😭😭
When I saw that some kid was starting over Woakes (and Wood) I didn't even bother watching.
The bowlers taking such a lazy walk when the batsmen were already there was incredible
"Spot on KP, It’s pathetic……."
"5-0. England have big heads after winning a few games against Ireland and other lower quality opposition with Bazball, but are not bothering to actually turn up here in the Ashes"
Kp was right
"As an Aussie, I’m stoked England declared at 390 that first innings in the first test.
I’m also happy they’re being all jovial with the Aussies - in years past there was plenty of niggle and aggression. Jovial can wait until after the series - a few beers and laughs for sure - but when it’s on, it’s on. 
KP is right."
So is the Captain.
Everything is so PC. It started in football and has seeped into cricket
I’m stoked they are batting recklessly. It gives the aussies plenty of time and options. It’s like this england team doesn’t get test cricket. It’s pretty funny
 @alexjones7043  agreed mate
" @alexjones7043  England is Stoked too, just in a different way"
"Amazing how England players are friends with people who hate them? Friendship works both ways you fool. As for the first test, the way we play saved test cricket in a year. We ran that game and but for missed chances would have won it easily. You held onto our coat tails for 4 days, then crawled across the line. Second test test going the same way. A traditionalist and boring Australia trying to frustrate a side playing all of the cricket. How embarrassed must you be as an Aussie?"
Poor choices from team selection to tactics to poor performances
"KP this is cricket, the gentleman's sport. We don't do this pathetic no talking to one another you're invisible nonesense they do in football. 

But you're right about the toothless selection of gentle pace bowlers but that's the selectors' fault"
Even when KP texted SA players he was still in the battle and wanted to win no matter what. Great joke/ribbing by Ward but KP never suffered from lack of oomph or fight.
Well said KP. Says it how it is. 👍Expected so much more from our bowling attack today
"Plus most of the comments follow you like lambs. Come on England, win or lose they put test cricket back on the map and kept so called commentators like you in a job. Other wise test cricket may have died with out Stokes and his team, making test cricket attractive again."
❤️❤️
Catches win matches so England failed in that Dept but at least the chances were created which is something. This pitch will spin for Lyon.... guaranteed.
Love you KP 👍
"bazbollocks then, only thing we can win is the toss"
Gavaskar felt same in WTC final😂
"What better way to motivate an Australian than talking smack. 
Even worse when you can’t back it up, especially Robinson, the slowest “fast bowler” in England. 
OzBall reigned supreme in Day 1.
How will England respond….?"
"KP quite rightly going nuts. Looks like the ""pick your mates"" strategy is falling apart vs players that actually have to earn the shirt."
"Today England lost the ashes. A pathetic, schoolboy performance with the England team making basic mistakes. Some appalling bowling, to say the very least. Not a clue. It was painful to watch and it wasn't just the half arsed bowling, it was the general attitude; it's a bit of a jolly here at Lords today, let's be friends. No. Let's crush the Aussies...should be the attitude and may in the first few overs this was evident but after that it was amateur hour again as the England team entirely capitulated as it did in Australia in very recent memory. And no spin bowler? I mean which idiot chose this team? The real highlight today was seeing those entitled idiot protestors taken away. Bairstow's carry being the only memorable moment from an English point of view........dire."
kP talking about being over friendly with the opposition 😳 really!!!! 😂
Don’t you know Kevin? Players can’t be aggressive with the opposition anymore. It’s just so toxic 🙄🙄
Shouldn't have booed Smith. You saw him as soon as he came in. Double hundred coming up
Come to New Zealand England 🌚
"Same old England, 6 man committees mid over ordinary discipline from bowlers with no balls and line and length. Woeful. If you are going to serve that up you should bat first and play your glorified pyjama party style and try to post a total."
damn he's tall!
Believe Mccullum doesn't hammer anyone. I know that as a kkr fan. Players are happy and laid back
But they feel like winners 😂
England believe their own hype about their new maverick style!  They are gonna get smashed.
Not KPs biggest fan but he’s 💯% right. Englands behaviour is SOOO contradictory. BIG talk before the game but shrunk in their corners the second the game started.
They have messed up the first test and it doesn't look optimistic in this test for the England. I hope they can turn things around
"But, but, but....bazball"
"Broad was just laughing with warner. Not interested in winning. I doubt Australia will declare 'to move the game on' so it""ll be trying to avoid a whitewash alteady."
Well spoken kp much too Paley for my liking just like the Australian team of 85 and border soon changed that in 89
"The arrogance of this England team will undo them.
Ashes will be gone before they know it."
"The England Team is like all England teams in any sport. They don't care less.  All these academies, Pitches etc and we can't produce winning teams."
"Yoh, KP towering over his colleagues like Gandalf."
The 393 declaration was a shocker.
This is the equivalent of the Roy Keane meltdown during the Manchester derby 😂🤣
Maybe for the 1st time; KP has made sense!
"I thought KP was nuts , then I discovered this video."
"Kp is always honest that’s why most of England players don like him. It’s green pitch and all bowlers are bowling halfway deliveries. 
Get new fast bowlers who have aggression, speed 💨"
Well said KP! There was a lot of no balls and wasteful bowling! The highlight of the day was Jonny carrying off the protester! We need to get better ti have chance of winning the ashes
England's bowling was wayward and all over the place. Anderson and Broad look tired.
Australia's pace attack is going to end some careers on that deck. 🤣👍
Well said KEVIN
Vaughn was even more scathing calling the England team far too casual.
You know it’s poor bowling when warner gets past 15
Australians will win the ashes series of 2023 by 5-0
Absolutely shameful performance by Team England  both in men's and women's cricket team
Why don't you acknowledge that aussies batted well in these conditions.
"Kp wow. He speaks negative everywhere he does commentary, when will kp start positive commentary. Aussies did bat well and england dropped warner early , why blame the bowlers."
KP is saying right ❤❤
Looks shocking. Why are they so chummy with the batsmen? Might as well knock it on the head and go for a beer.
How tall is KP?  He is absolutely dwarfing the other lads.
i thought BAZ ball had the Australians bothered you flop.
"Hammering the nail on its head...KP...👏👏🔥  Looked like pedestrian and tired bowling the whole day from England, and that too in favourable conditions after winning the toss... Looks like a long series this for England.."
Well said Kip where were the English team
"England were poor today, but lets face it, Australia batted incredibly well in those conditions. Also, have we all forgotten what an absolute Gasgoigne of a career Peterson had? the guy played about 10 good innings then spent the rest of his time thinking he was better than everyone else. his opinion is less than nothing."
Love this and love Kevin’s passion. Completely agree with him and it’s nice to see he didn’t hold back and said what he thought. Authenticity and honesty goes a long way.
You do know he was literally texting the opposition team slagging off his england teammates during test matches right? The guys an absolute tail
Stokes is an arrogant captain
South african. Love test cricket and yeah... sorry but England did not show up. Its a long way back from here.
"It's not just they are only 5 down, they've scored nearly 350 in a day that favours bowlers, and our part time spinner has taken 2 of the wickets. I really think the selection had been wrong for both tests. Robinson clearly isn't fit, feel like Jimmy isn't either. Fielding not great, led by a keeper who isn't first choice. Bazball is great but you have to question what's going on after days like these"
"The captains of border,Taylor, waugh,pointing,Smith,Clarke and Cummins all great aussies don't do pally amongst their opposition when come to ashes battles,and they do that afterwards when the series has finished"
Bazball not workin 😂
"A WHITEWASH IS ON ITS WAY ,WHAT A JOKE"
I said to tons of people the declaration was wrong and way too soon...But lots because of Bazball wont have it... If we couls get 450-500 vs the Aussies you get it just as they would.... keep the momentum keep the high ground.. We should never have loet the 1st test... I love the aggressive batting but 2-3 tecklesd wickets were lost charging way down the wicket...
Fact is that Anderson isn't the bowler he used to be. Man's a legend but shouldn't be playing now. Broad is fast approaching that time aswell.
“You set me up here” you set your self up kp😂 completely right though
When KP is on commentary our volume goes down -   opinionated verbal diarrhea for 30 minutes non stop.    If only he paused for breath occasionally .....
"Completely agree, great stuff from KP. England are weak atm"
KP sounds like Roy Keane😅
"Completely agreed... plus, what's James Anderson doing out there?? England can't afford to rest a paceman after just doing one or two spells that's insane, the longer he plays the worse he could bring to the fast-bowling squad. JA, it's time to pack up mate..."
Time to check into a nursing home I think
Guess they r trying him to play 200 test matches
Is Kevin Peterson massive or are the other 2 tiny
"I wonder if Steve Smith gets his century would they declare 🧐🤔 I know the answer to that one with the aussies brand of cricket being smartball,and it has been successful for them for the last 5 years and the reason they are the world test champions 👌👍and the bazball crap will be burst sooner than later after this second test"
They just wasting Mark wood for nothing and playing 3 80Mph 😂
Are People turning on Bazball? Winning the ashes is more important than entertaining I would say. Don't get me wrong it has been great viewing in past series but this is The Ashes and Ben Stokes took it a step to far in that first test by declaring like he did.
"Well done KP.  We're playing the test champions,  not the Dog and Duck 11 !"
"KP is completely correct for once! Ben Stokes is a shambles, Bazball is a shambles, saying ""I don't want to always get the selection correct as it would be boring"" is a outrageous. This summer of cricket has been completely ruined and all the England players should be fined and made to apologise to the die hard cricket fans like myself. 
Never going to any County or England game ever again until the board and McCullum go"
6 days of cricket is all it takes for this assessment? 😂
Anderson and an injured Stokes shouldn’t have been picked.
Why play two spinners in Root and Robinson?
kp speaking sense
English bowler seem pale.if not for joe root they would be scoring 400 Such tall bowler's yet the generate no pace
Totally agree with KP
Joe root was the best bowler lol
"how's that ""Bazball"" (cringe) coming along?"
Stop moaning and just admit that the Australia in so much better than the English team
Yes yes KP
So much for Bazball. This is why you shouldnt get carried away and become arrogant. The promo before the series was a joke. Declaring at 393 in the first test was stupid. You need to acore 450 + to give yourself a chance. 4 medium pacers against a top class top order. 😂😂😂
But honestly fielding was even worse
People are saying bazball is here to entertain but I think it is spoiling test cricket. In the name of bazball the pitches are made flat and emphasis is only about scoring runs. After all cricket is only about batsman and boundaries. RIP cricket !!
"One thing about kp apart from being a superb batsmen,hes not frightened to speak his mind unlike so many others"
"Agreed. Love him or hate him, he's an honest fella."
KP. I definitely agree with every word from a true legend ❤❤
"Ever since the first test, he hated the declaration"
well said Pietersen
5-0 aus win ashes
He's tall
even SA women team bowler Shabnam Ismael can bowl 128 kph  than English pacers😂
James Anderson is finished as a fast bowler come sunday he should announce his England retirement.
Club culture 😂
Called shambolic by a man who leaked game plans to the opposition
"Spot on KP there were time 9 years ago when a brutally fired up Mitch Beast Johnson tore through the english, and KP was part of that with him being one of the protagonist in one of the heat moments. Nowadays the players have gone strawberries and candies, either they  mindlessly sledge a hammer bashing innings of 141 or they stay cutie pies with each other on the field."
Johnson retired half the team that series 😂😂😂😂
Lmao so true
Morgan looked like Sunil gavaskar at first but when he spoke ohh he was Morgan 🤣🤣 anyone else? If yes hiy a like I'll know you did tu 🤣🤣🙌
This is gold🤣🤣
Australia is a far better test team than England. Average English side VS one of the greatest test sides in the history of ALL cricket.... are we being fair to the English?
Kevin Peterson is a South African anyway😄
Absolutely spot on. The most exciting thing about England today was when Bairstow tackled that protester.
😂😂😂😂
"Okay, that's the first time I've thought KP was necessary at Sky Sports - he's as close as you can on broadcast TV to losing it over how anaemic England looked today. Old habits dying hard with the 12 no balls to add to the 24 other extras given away. This is why I wasn't too keen on Robinson playing the pantomime villain for the Aussies because he's just playing into their hands. They need to wake up here before it's too late."
Spot on
Spot on KP 👍
"KP made some excellent points but what about him and the South African team, he was mole for them texting them stuff because him and Strauss were at loggerheads so a bit  hypocritical there Kev."
Today Kp was on 🔥
..
What a genius put down by Ian Ward there
England done a big mistakes in both test matches
KP Doesn't hold back.. Does He??
"Speak in Afrikaans KP a proper rant, uit kaak, daai England is kask sleg!! 🤣🤣 It's still strange an English Afrikaaner not from Birmingham but Pietermaritzburg!!"
"Current England team living in a fools paradise.Thinking they beat some rubbish teams and can now carry that on with Australia,Not going to happen.
I think Glenn McGrath joked about 5-0 well England better get their act together or the result won’t be far off that .😮"
😂😂😂😂 great play 🇦🇺💚💛 that shut Robinson and co up
Spot on KP !!!!!!
Its only a game.
Truth
It’s a Jimmy Stuart farewell party at 75 clicks
The same opinion with India when India play against Pakistan
england is like kenya v australia no competition boring to watch from pakistan :face-green-smiling: 5/0 incomming i think
KP don't bring up Punters name again.. It was 15 yrs ago😂😂
Brutally honest 💯
Kp looks gigantic

Root saved them some blushes otherwise Bazball player Stokes would be heavily criticised both for his team selection, and for his decision to ball first."

"My channel got a one week strike over community guideline violations on child safety. An old video of myself got me fucked over by the platform! Thanks, YouTube!"

You’re right!
Joe fist fighting corporate jerks on the side of the street? I'd pay to see that

Youtube has become a woke dump with stupid rules that only favor the usual. This shitty platform sucks more and more every day.
Did they take the original video down from his channel?
Still happening today. Even small channels.
I can't even upload a video without some of my videos getting blocked.  This system sucks

If anything I would say it's gotten worse especially after beer flu lockdowns. Now we've got demonetizations as well as Google removing or at least censoring anything that opposes their ideology
It always seems like he’s mad at me an I am always apologizing to these videos 😭
I support your video in full keep up the good work bro
Joe vargas needs to be the next ceo for youtube.
A legendary video..
Now Joe is part of the corporate greed he once hated.
"I hate Copyright infringements, on a video I had to use someones else Video because I don't want to destroy my computer, That Prick who made that video Threatened to Copyright my video, I refused to because I didn't believe, guess what? He did, I Am pissed because I had to watch that bullshit copyright school, And the quiz answers wasn't even in the fucking video, and It was fucking hard, He even put me in a playlist of ""people Who stole my videos"" and had to delete another video that includes the video that includes that video, I did delete the video because I don't want another copyright strike, It's bullshit, I Don't make money off it, fuck!"
"Are those “62+” flagged videos still available today?
‘Cause if they aren’t, I’ll be flaming mad!😡😡😡"
An absolute classic! :)
I can't believe this is 8 years ago Joseph.. Wow time flys!!
This video is more relevant than ever
The very first Angry Joe video I ever watched.
I'm gonna cry :(
whats crazy is 9 years later this still happens to people
Hell it's getting worse
0:53 i agree with joe 🤣🤣
I'm not yet a monthly subscriber thanks for the comment.R150 (south Africa's currency) times that with 12 months a year i would've lost a lot of money.what do you guys think
YouTube is getting worse and worse. I’m sorry man.
"So, YouTube has been having problems for years."
"YouTube is the beast. Instead of removing my post and violating my ©®™ they should be dismantled and put to death, because silence is death as YouTube are nazi minded, an n. word ..."
Is shit like this that makes you wanna rally Up and raid the YouTube HQ
YouTube hq needs some anarchy in it and boom*ng ............ Obviously in Minecraft.
Peak Joe.
"Watching this in 2022 

Sadly youtube doesn't give a fuck at all Like all of my videos got blocked because of a fucking Japanese company 

For that japanese company 

HONTO NI BAKEMONO YOU MOTHERFUCKERS"
YouTube was bitch made during this time and they chose very poorly.
Copyright gives me road rage.
Hilarious watching this 8 years later. People thought it was bad then. They had NO idea how bad it would get.
I still remember watching this video and it really shows the heart and passion that  angry Joe still has until this day I did make a channel but I stopped cause of what youtube did for there content creaters.But angry Joe we love and appreciate your very very very hard work of bringing us the awesome work you've done ✊
4:11 now this happening to totally not mark
still mostly applies today
"This video is from 2013, but I feel like if this video was uploaded recently xD"
I’m from the future
"8 years later.. Just look what's going on.. Joe, this will forever be your best video. Respect.✌️"
True. Pure righteous rage
it's even worse now lol.
it sucks that it seems like nothing has happened since then
Still a classic AJ rant. 💪🏽
I got a false claim by Capcom USA after streaming Let’s Play Okami HD Part 2 because of Okami HD Gameplay.
You cant even upload straight gameplay now its just monetized by company. Lol
" @dzenacs2011  Exactly. I had to dispute it by saying that I’m not doing this just for money; I do this because I love doing a commentary on my gameplay. And then later, I just got an email saying “Good news! After reviewing your dispute, capcom decided to release the Copyright Claim”."
"I feel the same, my man! I don't see how using The Beatles Music on my video would hurt the music industry. Bullshit! 
You can't even use the midi because they copyright the fucking melody! What the heck is wrong with Youtube!"
2:46 🤦🏻‍♂️
are they expect every content creators to be able to compose the music?!! You gotta think about this shit YouTube!!
Not to mention about the game ads
:/
"Here is a list of all the Movies and songs I liked!

1: copywright blocked
2: copywright blocked
3: copywright blocked
4: copywright blocked
5: Different Heaven & EH!DE - My Heart
6: copywright blocked
7: copywright blocked

I Hope you all enjoy like I did and buy their content! :)"
"Joe you need to drink water in times like this or you're gonna have a heart attack, I'm serious, I really worried for you in this video
you must know your body's limits, if you try to pass them best case scenario you're gonna hard crash and worst case scenario you're gonna shutdown completely, forever"
"Well this video is 7 years old and he is still alive, and in those 7 years he made multiple ranting videos so this comment is pointless lmfao"
I’m here because of scream 4 and the collection full movies that are copyrighted
"And now... YouTube can monetise content from channels who don’t get cuts. 

Why would YouTube ever monetise new channels when they make basically 100% of the revenue instead of 40. 

GG"
the dislikes are from the youtube bots
@GamersVow yeah i know youtube removed them...
"7 YEARS
7 YEARS
WHY"
2:46
"Multiple ads, insane copyright claims u cant win, shadow bans and promoting degenerate trash to audience, shit is a million times worse man, remaster this vid angry joe!"
"I love how this is still relevant, even 7 years afterwards..."
This is all soozan wojcocki's fault
Soozan Pochinki?
"Has gotten worse. I'm a drummer who posts covers of his favorite artists and EVERY SINGLE ONE of my videos is demonitized because of this scummy copyright system. Also, some videos I can't even publish because of how stupid this robotic dumpsterfire is. Genuinely disgusting."
Lets riot
The copyright rules are retarded
Seven years later nothing changes.
2:46 Joe trying to contain the fury 😂
Пхахаза
Angry Joe is right he is telling the truth
Its 2021 . Shit hasn't really changed
7 years later and shits gotten worse. This video was a warning to us for the worst to come.
its still the same
"Oh, they do things to people with just a PLAYLIST. I had a playlist with a name ""Fake News"" and got a strike - I didn't upload the video; I just put it in a playlist. They ended up removing the video that was a critique of CNN. It's not that it wasn't a valid video - they took it down and I got a strike for having shared it. I think the problem is Google. I don't think it was this way when Yahoo owned it. When Google bought it, they also wanted people to use their REAL names. Yahoo had told us NOT TO because of the danger of using real names. I told them I would lose followers as I had this user name for years before. I was not going to start over again. Not sure what made them decide I could keep it. The argument that Yahoo had said not to use our real names? I dunno. Facebook is the same way. I've got some of my own content, but there are some videos I want to upload using fair use because it's going to be taken down due to political correctness eventually. Moving to other media platforms that promote free speech and fair use of banned videos. Hope you find a place to get your videos posted. Totally agree about the Google plus issue. That's part of the ""real name"" business. The only way I could use it was to use my handle as a business which it's not."
This video is epic and once in a while I keep coming back to it to see Joe rant!
I blame YouTube.
7 years later this video is stilling going on to smaller channels like myself
"Reject YouTube, return to Newgrounds."
SUPER ANGRY JOE
Furious Joe mode!!
"I wanna be a youtube staff so I can fuck over everyone that loves me 
Sarcasm"
One of his great rants! Pure! ...... his more like passive aggressive joe now
"Well, there is the explosive type of anger, and there is the implosive type of anger. If I was YouTube, I wouldn't be worried with guys like Angry Joe, but I would watch my back, afraid of those silent guys that put up with YouTube's sh*t, day after day, silently building pressure up, and up, and up. Just saying."
"Nowadays, it is far, far worse."
Most fuckin honest person here...
"How many Bad words do you want
Angry joe: Hell yeah!"
It's only gotten worse since then.
That's exactly why youtube is dead because they don't care fuck them all.
The amount of views this video has is insulting... It should be more. Far more
Just 5 minutes is this video and I already am about to subscribe
Even the Constitution says we have freedom of speech. Which they are removing by not allowing Joe to review games and give his opinions
He's right
Up...
"YouTube is getting much worse hardly worth bothering with now ,,money money ,money they love it"
6 years and nothing has changed. Who agrees that we should protest in front of YouTube HQ?
I'm confused how does copyright claims work and what is a copyright
Even his angry joe mass effect andromeda review is age restricted
That’s when you tube went downhill
7 Dollar Sanchez
"Looking back at this now, this was the start of censorship. Big corps. censoring creators who give a ""constructive"" review fair and square. And then they moved on to people that have a different opinion than the radical left. These are the signs of a communist era we will be entering in. It's literally happening as we speak."
"eppsislike yeah bro, I hate the radical left, fuck 'em"
these problems are still very prevalent today
Understandably that YouTube is actually quite broken however I think there is a solution to this problem Sensei failed mechanic is going on with in YouTube and they are not so willing to fix itfalse verification or fraud in another waytherefore you could actually strike back at you tube within the court of law as stealing or theft as this is a public platform made for public usage strictly within the hands of the publicabide by the countries on which they work inpotentially be a major lawsuit for YouTubenot only by the person that these bots are striking but also by the company that it is claiming to represent but I am not a lawyer so I'm just giving a subjective no I could be completely wrong in this category and if I am I will be more than happy to see if I am actually wrong about thishowever if I'm not this could be quite a large lawsuit for you angry Joe and you could actually sue them for lost revenue but again I do not actually know court of law and I am no lawyer however there is a YouTuber that is a lawyerI recommend giving him an email about it maybe he could give some better inside
YouTube sold out. They put profit before the creators. They’re predictable snakes.
I just came here after reading a comment on the EA/NFL renewal of their exclusive license... damn it breaks my heart to see nothing changed after all these years... ☹
"Oh yes we understand. You, RichGuyJoe, are the one of the ones truly suffering from this. It's not like some people live in fucking apartments and still struggle, no, you in your house with an expensive TV in the background are the one truly suffering."
ok
"@Charles Thigpen Charles Thigpen I do, some YouTubers get bent over by the YouTube algorithm and system, rarely seen them complain, meanwhile RichGuyJoe has to wine his ass off and beg for money eventually for a couple of videos."
This is pretty much the best angry joe rant and It still holds up to this day as his greatest rant.
Well this aged perfectly.
This video aged like a fine wine
It's 2020 and this problem is still happening!
As true today as it was back then.
YouTube does put in some bullshit it sucks
This still holds up
6 YEARS!!! 6 YEARS FUCKING LATER AND YOUTUBE HAS DONE NOTHING TO CHANGE THIS BULL SHIT
much worse now then anything else....
This will basically make us get real jobs
On the topic of watching full movies on YouTube and pirating there are times when your watching clips of a movie there is another company that didn’t make the movie just for the sake of being annoying
This shit is STILL happening.
"You think this is bad? Try uploading a personal compilation on Facebook of yourself with copyrighted music. I made no money, had no ads and the video was for friends-only and I still got copyright striked. This is what happens when big tech has taken over....."
still come back to this legendary rant
Maybe Youtube should have declined google's offer to buy it.
"So this spreads and punish ppl since 2013... Then Soppa, now Coppa..."
"If Soppa is dead fast, then hopefully Coppa will and we'll be free to comment on any videos we want. I can't comment on Tom and Jerry videos because of this shit!"
"SOPA*
COPPA*"
"Joe, we need your help, pls contact with MXR channel, the fucking Jukin Media is tryin to strike his channel, give him an advise..."
"Lmfao read the description and it says ""This isn't the way"" and vise-verca it's ""This is the way"" which is in The Mandalorian. HE PREDICTED THE MANDALORIAN's MOST MEMED QUOTE!"
and here we are back to this again
"This was the first video of yours i watched, still here"
Angry Joe? More like Furious Joe.
His angriest since sonic free riders
"When Joe starring at you on the beginning of the video


Better Turn Down Your Volume"
0:00
Oh boy here it comes brace your ears 9:03
"This is really stupid and BS! Why would they do this? I’m a christian gamer and I have a massive love for video games and Jesus. I was born in 1989 and I been playing video games my whole life. This makes me upset and I think a lot of people are upset over this stupid content ID system. :’(
YouTube please get rid of this and go back to the way it was cause this is wrong and illegal."
I wish I could like this video multiple times
This video is still relevent nearly 6 years later
Good rant!
62 is really too much
"We need a content creators page by content creators. Fuck Google, fuck YouTube and fuck Facebook, ect.

* Really? This comment was reported."
What if this video got claimed
what the heck youtube!
"One of the greatest things ever was when he was mentioned at the Game Awards and the scene with him holding all the money saying ""THIS IS ALL YOU PEOPLE CARE ABOUT!"" showed in front of hundreds of greedy publishers, and messed up journalists and devs. Like man you couldn't have picked a BETTER scene for that."
I know how you feel mr joe. When i make amv or music vids i say that i am not making any money nor want to profit off of others and yet youtube still doesnt give a crap lol. I had most of my vids claimed and i am a small youtuber lol. I know what your going through joe i hope things change
Fuck copyrights
Rules are rules it’s a business angry joe doesn’t get it
Fuk u
Notice anything eerie? Ajs room looks like a hotel.
"You don't have to stop your show Angry joe. you do what more and more people are doing to you tube. you claim we don't have power. Guess what WE DO. WE move our shit to another service and let Google go bankrupt. We move to things liek Twitch. Vemo, VeVo Daily motion. ANYWHERE  that is not owned or youtube has shares in. They loose users, by loosing users means the fat fucks of you tube loose money because we 1: get fed up of their utter fuckwit bull shit 2: get fed up with them being greedy fuckwits."
"Helluva PipeBomb!
... Unfortunately, things are still getting worse.
I'm sorry Joe. Thank You though for your voice of Validity."
what about that new thing youtube premium if you buy it you will not have commercials
Five stages of grief demonstrated under 20 minutes.
"There's a youtuber that got 30-40% of ALL HIS videos flagged and demonetized because of 1-2 second clips of BACKGROUND (VERY low volume, barely hearable) in a Game that was SPONSORED by the company who made it."
5:00 Oof
YouTube in a nutshell by AngryJoeShow
"Uff and it got worse. Beside that now on these days (2019),they are exaggerating the adds. I feel like Im seen videos on a poor website."
@ 1:54 “my Tomb Raider interview with the Tomb Raider people have been claimed by Tomb Raider” lol 😂
This is still Angry Joe's best rant
"2019
YouTubers: there will be consuquences
YouTube:yeah,right
2039
YouTube: why am I the most hated of the internet
Youtubers: good question"
"move to Bitchute, everyone else is ( hopefully)"
Six years later and it's gotten even worse.
I'm sure EA was getting a piece of this...
"6 years later and this still applies. I streamed Kingdom Hearts 3, and had to dispute a copyright claim.
I was playing the game, not letting the menu music play, etc."
"I came back to this video as i was striked by community guidelines FOR A PRIVATE PLAYLIST OF MINE, WHAT IN THE LIVING FUCK YOUTUBE?!"
eee eee eee
"YouTube, parent companies - Google and Alphabet. Google and YouTube are Liberal run Left companies. They need to be broken up"
2019...It got worse...
Fuck copyright
"YouTube copyright strike, what a disaster and a disgrace. Jesus."
The system is a pyramid scheme
i know how you feel even though this is old but still its true cause i had a copyright strike 2 times over a anime music video even though i put discrptions down below and links to the songs. youtube is broken and i know your pain joe. and the part where you say about youtube not responding to emails adressing the situation is also true i tried to email them when i got a copyright strike and they just ignored or blocked it. they really dont wanna hear us lol god bless you mr joe
2:46
What's the point of bleeping in the beginning if later cursing isn't bleeped.
Probably he was editing it and he was fuck it
Because youtube only see 30 seconds in the video
this was almost 6 years ago. It has gotten so much worse.
Answer the 2:46
YouTube sides with the company on the get go cause they get revenue from these companies otherwise Youtube can't survive thus companies can abuse this system if they see fit to
5 stages of grief in action.
"I hit 200 Subscribers at the time he made this video. Everything was going good then EVERYTHING I uploaded was flagged for playing a game as I enjoyed making walkthroughs, Guides, Etc I also was able to monetize my videos and then I stopped, I deleted my videos and quit youtube as I wasn't  able to upload ANYTHING without some sort of flag. I'm now at 208 subscribers as I started uploading again but I heard it hasn't gotten any better, Who knows how big I could of gotten if I continued... I love your videos Joe! Glad to see your still making videos!"
5 years later this is still true youtobe even wrose
"You liberal tard...YOU VOTE FOR THIS!! You side with liberallism, globallism, huge mega corperations. Libral joe votes for the corruption. No one likes SJW abortionist. I bet joe sings a new song these days, liberals cant admit if they have been duped"
Five years later and nothing has changed
Don't bull pee me
"13:36
I'd like to point out that Joe said he's been doing Youtube ""80 hours a week for the past 4 years with no vacation.""

He took his FIRST vacation in 2017 and people complained -_- wtf"
Yeah but watching movies to review and playing games isn't really work
"2013: You get copyright striked by using music that was'nt made by the same company
2019: You get copyright striked by talking"
2025: You get copyright striked by living.
"gives game a 5/10
video gets copyrighted"
"Funny how even in 2019 not only is this still an issue, it's getting worse. All YouTube does is punish the people who made it what it is."
i know and you do it 50 times and youtube dosent ask you but youtube wants that they thing is fair but is unfair 😑🙄😑🙄
With my channel I have to be super careful with  what game I choose to play and always make sure the in-game radio is turned off
this is still relevant today...
It's uh... It's still shit Joe.
5 years ago and everyone's still afraid...
Even tho how much we rant... we dont have a choice because there is no other site than youtube we can see good vids... yep... monopoly
5 years later and it has gotten even worse
That looks like my jacket time to copyright strike
5 years later... same shit lam0
I have been fucked by this system at least 4 times
And you will not survive
"9:03 so this was the clip that got ""featured"" at the game awards ^"
"this is comedy now,  this is everyday life"
"And this was in 2013.
Still relevant.
YouTube has only gotten worse over the past five years.
The good news is that we now have their attention.
Their big flashy YouTube™ Rewind© 2018®™™™ is now the most disliked video on the entire platform.
It took ten million dislikes to finally get their attention.
Let's finish the job."
aaahaha
12:14 Exactly.
I'm trying to upload a tick tock compilation I maid of my tick tock videos and just because it has like 2 sounds that are only in total like 30 seconds of 12 minutes that were blocked in all countries they blocked my video
Plus I only have 32 subs and I dont make any money off these videos
Watch other youtubers they using the videos they have the rights to show every content in the market maybe joe has to apply to use them somehow
ufc gave me a copyright strike and removed my 236k video while people are subbing and now they have taken that away
In some cases ...artis are dead ....no body listening or playing they shit or reviewing it.
Right.
I never will understand...if you buy the fucking game or cd ...then it's yours......you brought it ...you own it ....THEN DONT SELL THE MUSIC OR MAKE ANY CDS.  .ITS BULL SHIT
Are  you really angry or is it a joke ?
What kind of question is that? OF COURSE HE'S ANGRY
I got the same thing today umg
"""yes I do I have 7 dollars"""
I'm surprised no one make a meme out of this 9:00 - 9:09
"Ya, I thought it would take off"
"FB is doing even worse to us.. with algorythms, 2x they've taken HALF of my fan base! They CHARGE ME too get my posts out to my people, because their algorithms say only a few people are going to get to see my content, unless ALL THOSE PEOPLE like it, then it will go on to other people's timelines, and IF, ONLY IF THEY LIKE IT,  THEN it will go  on to other people's timelines too! Destroyed my empire of metal... we had a strong family, and FB KILLED IT...They're killing themselves"
Almost 5 years and still the same problem
"I love how he acts like he doesn’t need YouTube, and I love how h acts like he’s gonna do something about it. Get over it you’re not that big anyway"
This video is almost 5 years old if you didn't know that.
"Even after four years, they are still pulling thisshit"
Thats why theres another platform out there which is so much better than youtube.
"Vidme shut down a while ago...
If you're referencing another platform, could you tell us about it? It'd help to know of an alternative to youtube (that is not Vimeo)"
This is sad greedy suck not fair
He needs a hug
No. He needs an alternative for YouTube.
12:04
Youtube: we hate our creators
Can we get this channel to 3M subscribers?
it needs to overtake morgz mom
"Hey dude. I completely agree with you. I can't live stream again without getting paranoid or scared that I'm going to get a copyright strike. I've had videos taken down just because there was a copyrighted song that was not edited in, but in the game!"
MONEY IS GOD PEOPLE ARE NOTHING FUCK YOUR CORPORATE AGENDA ITS TIME FOR CHANGE
GO TO THE PRESS
BOYCOTT YOUTUBE
BOYCOTT !!!!!
BOYCOTT YOUTUBE ..... WE NEED A NEW SITE LIKE YOUTUBE
MAYBE THEY WANT US TO BEAT OUR DICKS INSTEAD ON YOUTUBE
PRESEASON FUCKERS...... FUCK YOU YOUTUBE
"I FEEL YOU BRO..... A FUCKING NFL PRESEASON GAME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LIVE STREAM THEY KEEP BLOCKING IT OUT 
PHILADELPHIA AT NEW ENGLAND MOTHER FUCKERS KICKING AMERICANS IN THE DICK FUCK YOU YOUTUBE"
SOCIALIST FUCKERS DEMOGOG FUCKS
FUCK YOU YOUTUBE...... STUPID FUCKS
THIS IS THE SOFT PUSSY SIDE OF AMERICA
YouTube needs to go down and be rebuilt
This will remain in the top 10 best angry rants love you angry joe been a fan since 2013.
I agree Joe I'm with you in your side let's show this motherfuckers what it really means to mess with our videos
Still true to this day
Im waiting for a follow up
I think you should make your own YouTube and just quit. So everything is yours. No permissions needed
IS IT STILL THIS WAY? IM SORRY FOR THEM....
5 years have passed. Now it's 10 times worse than this!
Angry Joe please help I worked so hard on my parody of Yu-Gi-Oh just to have it so blocked and flaged because of copy rights and I voiced over 7 min and sound effects and ect. And was going to split 1 episode to make like 3 episode to make sure I didn't get copyrights and I stated all rights to original and song creaters down to names.
nothing on shit tube    any more
"I felt like this was released in 2015, but damn this was in 2013"
Keep flaming those DOGS
YouTube has Become a Disaster They Flag Evey content Not Allowing anyone to use anything so sick of this mothefuckers already
Now it is even worse.
whats fucking next FLAGGING CAT VIDEOS!!??
"5 years later and I still can’t put up a decent mix for entertainment purposes without it getting flagged and having to constantly alter it to which it gets taken down a month later with another song flagged.  Fuck you youtube.  For Djs, musicians, etc use SoundCloud and MixCloud.  10 years of my channel and YouTube is killing it slowly but surely."
"5 years from now, I am still watching this?"
I just got a bull shit claim on my last video from a Spanish youtube channel i have never heard of
It’s still happening...
It's funny how the cursing words were bleeped in the first minute but then the rest is uncensored.
"I have a question, about false copy right claims.
What if a copyright claim is false, and I want to dispute it.
There is cant be choosen, false copy right claim.
Only things like: i own it, this has no copy right and so on.
If someone has a false copyright claim, what reason should I choose if I want to dispute the false copyright???"
2018 and it's still just as true
Why do they have youtube kids but put on restrictions for youtube
Angry rant at its finest! And nothing changed in 2018...
Mate we all feel u mate...
Is joe and other creators still having problems with this?
This is NOTHING compared to your 1st Xbox One Fail Rant.
Go to Bitchute. YouTube is going to be the next MySpace .
Decentralization for the win and let’s get rid of these corrupt companies like youtube
how to beat content ID system???
Furqan Ahmed yes
"I got a video of mine taken down when I made it and I edited it myself without music, brands or anything and was forced to take the video down due to me having another player online that I killed. I am pretty sure that it was the person that I have killed in the clip that was the person who took it down."
have   ANY of the issues been addressed?   it doesnt feel like it.
Sad part is..... This is STILL RELEVANT IN 2018.
"YouTube will die one day. I’ve created my first YouTube video, and it’s already got slapped with a copyright. Didn’t even copy a full song."
"Yeah, let's rise against YouTube executive's who's with me!?"
It's sad to know that this video is still relevant today :(
Copyrights ruin everything. It's the sworn enemy of everyone who regularly uses clips from cartoons like Spongebob to portray recent trends.
Its sad that This video is still relevant now
i dont make any money and iv had to fight off wrong CC. its ok if the right people do for me but no u will not make money from someones work.
Capcom CC a conversation in a game. a convo not the game a fight some art a convo.
I'm fighting sme Japan rn... any advice... I need help
You should make a petition or something to make YT get rid of their system.
Same Joe because I put the copyright law on my video and they still give me a copyright claim!!
I don't blame you. I hate copyright too and we shouldn't have to get strikes especially when we don't even know that we'll get a strike if we put that specific content. And this is a video website so this shouldn't have to be that awful.
I uploaded a video where I used an anime theme song and it got blocked! I took it down but if I use it again every video using that is gonna start with me talking about fair use. I BET SPONGEBOB DIDN'T A COPYRIGHT CLAIM!
"YOUTUBE used to be awesome...but? Now it's a pile of massive shit like the LOGAN brothers, and Shane Dawson...and they're not even funny, but YOUTUBE pays them really well...I'm scratching my head now on how that is even possible."
Not suitable for most advertisers
"""I will fight you on the side of street"" 2016- beyond"
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
copy right law it'self is bullshit
I want to start a youtube channel of lets plays but im scared of the copy right claims and shit so thanks youtube
And now they fucked the small channels under 1000 subscribers..a big FUCK YOU GOOGLE. 🖕😠🖕
"4k dislike = ppl doing illegal shit in youtube lol 

YouTube sucks...💩"
I like how hes carefully picking back is 7dollars after throwing them around
Damn that vid really came heart hes completely mad
I got a copyright notice on a private video.
"Nevrr give up Joe, keep up the good revieuws"
"Hey Joe, I’m a viewer of your channel, and I love your honesty in your reviews. Just a thought as a new gamer...why do they have a share button on ALL of the consoles if your not allowed to share? Kinda seems weird to me. Lol....don’t stress to hard Joe. We luv ya"
Fuck these copyright strikes! I made a DiRT Showdown gameplay video and the fucking music in the game's background got copyright striked
"Just get up and sue them for copyfraud.

Sue YouTube for personal distress, or loss of income, or whatever you can take them to court for."
What they are doing is power tripping like two year old boys. :(
That’s fraud you should sue them
This guy means business YouTube isn't real anymore
cut it out with the censorship
And I love all these fan boys in the comments. Pathetic
"It’s so amazing how big of a whiner he is. He acts like he hasn’t made an easy living from YouTube. ;) 

And guess what?! You are being black balled because if your attitude, not your opinion. You’re a walking talking moronic Napoleon complex. You think you’re entitled YouTube should let you do whatever you like."
"I don't think people understand the like and dislike buttons.
4k dislikes? Gee they must love YouTube fucking youtubers."
Hahaha! Cherry face was about to blow back then.....he was about to cry out loud. Hahaha
Wow this is real d
Unacceptable. This kind of thing is only going to get worse. It's like Napster all over again :/
for the love of money is the root of all evil...
"I just got a strike from FOX for making a filming locations video. I used small clips showing the locations then and now and credited the source.  Isn't this Fair use? Any Tips?  Plus, it's promoting the film if anything!!!"
That's Shocking
i know im late for this one but he actually got choked up and you can tell hes sincerely passionate about this
"If Id have been youtube at that time, I would have been scared about this lion of a man xD"
Is this video claimed to be copywrited???
youtube is like indonesia..... they claim everything....and i mean everything
Luckily this is gone by now otherwise content creators like me with only 2 subs and 5 videos tomorrow would be forced to quit before they even started
"False copyright claims are illegal.. So I dont get how Youtube just allows this. 
I think what they need to do is have a penalty for false claims. $10,000 fine per company. That will stop them real fast."
that'd work too though i don't see a way they can uphold a fine they'd need legal power for that they have the right but i feel they should add in features to identify those that do false claim and when someone is found out remove their channel however since the system is gurenteed to have some bugs at the start maby change it to the strike system they already unfairly use on content creators but aimed at channels that issue false claims so that repeat offences get's the channel banned but it's just a slap for the first 2 problem there then is how would they possibly do that and also how long would they have to do so since a system like that is bound for abuse just like the false claim is so for now they just need a way to report a channel for acting in such a way and have there good for nothing lazy employees actually look into it and see if there is any merit to assuming the claims made by the channel are false and if there is ban the channel that will stop the system from easily being abused and get rid of these company's real fast cause they'd now have to make it through a firewall made up of  people who don't want them there
"They are technically not illegal, since Youtube's systems aren't legally binding. It only becomes illegal if you take it up to court and it's proven in court that the claim is false."
time to start making our own youtube style website
I got copyright claim for soundtrack in Alien Isolation from company which doesn't have rights to it... wtf!? 30 DAYS OF NIGHT-The One who fights wasn't even used in Alien Isolation. It is fucking illegal so it's even worse than Joe's case. BTW. the claiming side is [Merlin] PIAS
Joe you should be a politician because you are not corropted !
And it only got worst
Get a real job lmao
I remember when this video was uploaded. I remember this was the video that made me subscribe to the channel.
"I Might have found this Video late and everything but there still really pinning down Games even now I wanted to become a game reviewer of old and new games, but I'm to scared to do it because of this whole thing with youtube now a day's. Really I wish there was another way to get started without being on twitch because like some people that are like me I don't have the internet behind me to hardly play online games all I want to do is make content, and upload it to some place but with Nintendo doing there stuff and youtube. I don't even want to get started because of the harm they do even if I made money else where even if I didn't do it for the money I bet I'll still be shut down within a year because of reviewing games. Overall wanting to be a new channel on youtube now I don't stand a chance of ever getting people to sub if all these people do is tear you down before you even step out onto the field.

I'm sorry to hear what happened to you i know it's 4 year's to late to say it but I still want to say it even now no one with big channels or even people that have been on here for so long especially people that review games it makes them money having Let's plays, and reviewers out there to get the word out on there products. because people see something they like they'll go out and buy it I don't know how many times i went out and bought a game just based on a review from someone i like or even seeing someone that had so much fun playing it in let play's."
I just got a copyright strike for a song from the PS4 EDITING SOFTWARE THAT IS FREE!!!!!!!!
joe you also only care about money
fuck the content creator viva thepiratbay
youtubes fucked these days joe buddy and btw I'm with you on all this shit and your so right copies and copies of bills and corporate lobbying its bullshit
"until corporations don't get looked at like people in law and corporate lobbying gets banned to politicians this wont get better. Btw when those young lads that made youtube what it was sold it this was due to happen, you know this as well I think Joe"
"bring the prices down and stop charging 60 quid for shitty titles that are not even early access quality then you will defeat piracy, I also think piracy doesn't do the dmg they make out, in some situations it benefits certain games in certain situations"
"Thank you angry joe for helping my essay on ""youtubes new rules are too restricted"""
2017 Nothing change.
"let's make a video chain in which everyone of us say ""YT SUCK MY BALLS"" and putting some music or copirighted names ON PURPOSE just to attract them, then you post it as we do and see what those shitbags can do..."
Thats what you get for talking shit about the Risen series you dumb noob !
thank god his censoring is gone
lol not close
I'm in 2017
I know you stopped allowing comments and i don't blame you when people get negative it is like all of the internet is getting worse and worse we used to have better radar on whether free phone searches were more abundant used to have lots of free good music on youtube to stream if they get worse and keep downgrading picking and choosing what should be common knowledge becoming like Idiocracy
I Got a Video Removed Just Over A Year Of Uploading It Just As The Video Was Starting to Get More Views! (the video was uploaded back in 2015 and taken down in earlier this year) Also there are other videos that are getting views on YouTube. Also there are other versions of the song and they aren't being pulled from YouTube so What the Hell!
"wow, that's rough"
Some prick just false copyright claim me.
7 shekel Sanchez
I'm having issues with a false claim. I posted a video on Aug 29 and some bs company put in a claim against me and is now monetizing my video under false pretense that they have exclusive rights to my video. They refuse to provide proof of claim but YouTube allows them to deny my dispute and appeal and monetize my video.
This is funny cause he says we made YouTube what they are then he shits on his fans after fans say we made you what you are joe damn irony
"Patrolling copyright is the worst because it takes a human touch and understanding. But YouTube is flooded with so much stuff everyday that it's impossible to patrol. So you dump a basic, blanket system that eats anything that matches with the reference material, even if a video game video is fundamentally different from the game itself. That kills me, really. A fucking videogame is not hurt because it's on YouTube. Movies? Yes. Songs? Yes.  But a videogame centered around player interaction? Yeah, no one will buy it after they see a video of someone else playing it, with no input in a interactive system! What a bunch of out of touch fuckwits."
"Joe got it right, still after 4 year's it is so Damn hard to be a Youtube Channel. We need support.
Please sub :)"
"copyrights, youtuber's worst enemy"
You TELL EM 'Joe!
"I did a let's play of Arkham Knight, and I was content ID'ed due to 40 seconds of a song, at the start of the game."
"its really stupid, because even if i dont make money off of copyrighted content, they wont take that as an explanation, like wtf, why even add that in the dispute process to begin with? something tells me youtube thinks it is above the law, to an extent."
"2017 and its even worse now, especially for youtubers who use ""Foul langauge"", #RIPYOUTUBE2017"
" Leirdo Man64  Bruh this comment is two years old, though youtube still is in pretty rough shape at least on the content creator side of things. As for your comment, Im confused to as the point. Cuss words are also known as swear words which is also known as profanity which is also known as foul langauge. I guess you could say Foul langauge is just a more proper term, though they are all still the same thing so  why are you angry ?"
WMG is the worst about this
I had an old channel I made a game review on (an indie one) it took me so long to make and it got removed for basically stating false information...a review. With my opinion
Fuck you give me money.
same thing here they flag me for in  game song
DId he su
0:01
YEAH THEY JUST COPY MY CHANNELS NOW I JUST DELETED ALL MY VIDEOS
Let's create something like freetube
"""Get your s*** together, or you're gonna ruin a really good thing here.""



They just did.
The freaking new Guideline is an absolute bulls***!"
"I can't believe YouTube is still like this today. Even if you have silent videos with no sound,no music, even the slightest sound, you'd get Copyright claim.
YOUTUBE!!! GET!! YOUR SHIT!! TOGETHER!!!"
the copyright shit needs to end. youtube is even worse about it now. even classical music gets content IDed
Almost 4 and getting worse
"5:06-5:18, lmfao!"
"2:35-3:06, just like cancer unfortunately."
Do worry it got sooooooooooo much worse!
"From 9:03 to 9:30, I actually thought Joe was going to legitimately start crying."
Michael Hrusovsky same
we need the orginal league of critics to come together one more time to make a movie and yt understand why their ways are bad.
This man deserves more attention
"this made most of the EDM music channels had to delete their videos back in 2013 :,("
"Angry Joe, Big fan by the way,

     Youtube has been bought by google, a company that takes care of their employees and their families. youtube has been corrupt from the beginning one bought by google. I would recommend that you advertise your website on youtube and post all the videos you want on your website. this would be the best way to counteract the loss of power on youtube. honestly, yes, youtube pays attention to the content with the most views. thats how they work, but ignore the fact that there are millions of bullshit videos on youtube that slip through the cracks. thats my take on it, or you can make a backup youtube account. obviously people are targeting you and your channel. its tedious, but you have to realize that most of the people in the world are viruses and look to kill its own kind's success."
This may not make sense but YouTube is basically turning into a civil war between the cruel YouTube government and youtuber rebels
I got strike because of the music playing in my car 😂
"Youtube 2007

Broadcast Yourself


Youtube now

Broadcast videos that make us money."
A Troll YouTube Now: Go Fuck Yourself
This. Shit. Is. Epic.
"Old ass video but I'm alittle lost here. With this shit getting worse now with claims, if fair use is under law through the constitution, this seems like it would be an easy fix? Go to the lawyers. If the shit's under law, why are these youtubers just posting vids about and letting themselves get bullied? Is there nothing they can do?"
Thx angry joe I really really wanted to here that from SOMEONE besides my own mouth
You always angry
"This reminds me of a saying. ""once the fruit is juiced, it's tossed aside"". YouTube just milked the money out of content creators then just tossed them aside"
And reaction channels get off scott-free while channels with real content suffer. Wow.
"If I say Half Life 3 confirmed, will I be sued for conspiracy?"
Fuck game companies who are large like capcom.Pirating old games is awesome.Fuck you greedy bastards.
I am a small YouTube channel
And look how little has changed with YouTube the corporate vulture.
well i got copyright claim because i used no copyright music on my video
Fuck them Joe. I love your reviews.(be careful somebody might claim your jacket or furniture or tv on this video)
get cancer youtube
how the fuck is joe still alive with this shit?
Google doesn't make any money off of you. YouTube is run at a loss.
very consise this is legit
preach it
4 years later here we are
Fuck all the companies that mess with Joe
"Smart man to know it was CISPA/SOPA/ACTA that was the reason for this.  You really can't blame youtube though for what the american people didn't care about and allowed to pass.  There ignorance has a trickle down effect, this is it.  I imagine they like the idea of information being stifled so that old rich families and corporations can keep there power and keep people in ignorance."
never seen him more pissed than in this video
YouTube's copyright policy can suck the fattest part of my dick Fucking Nazis
youtube clean up your act :(
Jesus christ Joe is about time you shut the fuck up. wahhhhh wahhhhh fucking cry baby.
joe is right so chill dude
Did you even watched the video and listem to him fuckhead
4 years in and things are getting worse.
YouTube changed for the worse after it was bought by Google.
looks like 4880 people support youtube in this
I actually got a copyright claim over a PS4 Livestream.
fuck you joe
Oh and yes he does. Do the homework. He has claimed on quite a few videos. ;)
You call yourself a legit creator?!?! You yell at videos and video games and get paid to do it...... just quit YouTube. No one will miss you.
Pecto's Revolution m8 your comment on a 4 year old video. get a life :)
You make money off of a system that was ok with no accountability until now. And guess what? They DO have the right ;). That's life.
You dont have any
It's crazy to think that at this time AngryJoe was worried for the future of his channel. I seriously thought after this video he would be deleted.
4 years now and still... its gotten worse. I CANT STREAM WITHOUT GETTING COPYRIGHT BULLSHIT!  Even NON copyrighted music is flagged on videos... it really is complete bullshit
"I may be new to AJA and this may have been posted in 2013 but i hope that the AJA of 2013 fucking rioted about this.
Corporate Commander will never win."
Make a new non gay youtube!
i support pirates.
I still come back and watch this
I don't even make money off my videos and I get flagged all the time. Even when I give credit and commentate over them.
"It's a damn shame they're doing this.  There's this guy, Don Shipley, who is a retired Navy SEAL who outs stolen valour imposters, and they made things a living hell for him, too.  Just for talking about another person and showing various pictures of them wearing fake-ass military medals, or sporting military tattoos for stuff they never were a part of.  The point is ... there's a lot of decent folks out there doing good honest work.  And for YouTube to throw them under the bus like this for the sake of automated (unambiguous) due diligence, is disgraceful.  Keep your head up, Joe."
Nearly 4 years later and YouTube might as well be dead.
"Now we're in the middle of another demonitisation/soft censorship scandal 4 years later... its only going to get worse. Just wait for them to eventually overstep one step to far, someone will make the successor to youtube. Youtube will shoot itself in the foot so many times it will eventually bleed out."
lol
He types like the flash
I can't believe this video was made in 2013 and we're still having problems in 2017
First of all your a youtuber
"Fair use is not a law, it's a defence."
"technically there have not the rights, because there don;t owning you voice and game Style and there for this fall under fair use. but youtube  don't understand  far use  laws and being rich there fore misuse their power, so as all rich humans do  Around whole history"
"Sadly it isn't YouTube's fault though, it is the USA laws, if YouTube tried to change​ there ways right now, they will have to shut down the website"
lol cracked up when he mushed his face
lmao!!! he's gonna fight google. XD
"I am furious at YT , I dont even make money off of my damned videos and I got a copy strike just for one AMV that probably 10000 people do everyday. DickTube is out of control."
he looks like Tony stark
">AngryJoeShow
wow, he IS angry."
"Man i tryly feel for you. You are a champion of a man. Don't give up, don't give up, the ranting is necessary and you are going to ask questions, I wish I knew who you could call, WOW< WOW< WOW< . Ya we are going to fix this shit ourself. You are starting a movement don't forget that."
fockkkkkkkkkkkk yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
my brother
subscrib to morgan barclift #funny
I agree!
even though this is an old video i wonder if he could get help from the people on or with Collider cause John Campia has a Law background
YouTube is under Google so I wonder what would need to be done for sure ?
"i'm wit you baby. fucking gootube
they censored and pulled my b-hive 60s playlist
fuck me jesus
gootube is a piece of shit.
oh yes and death to google"
how did this video get dislikes? And it did get worse
AngryJoeShow THANKYOU!!!!!!!!! EXACTLY!!!!!!! FUCK NINTENDO AND YOUTUBES BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"4k people dislike this lol people are so fucking stupid. so i hope all 4k if even that of you get your videos flagged and removed if you even fucking remotely speak your mind about any fucking thing that does not belong to you. i dont give a fuck if its your opinion if what your talking about is nothing that was yours originally you just need to shut the fuck up period. angry joe is right about how youtube started making money due to what he does along with what everyone else does rather its games, movies, music, art, or any other source of entertainment if it wasnt videos or opinions about anything in life then none of this shit would exsist."
i mostly make my own music and upload it minus a couple of vids
How did it come to this?
my persona video youtube say me copyright
made billions of dollars!!! now FUCK ALL OF YOU!!!!...............yup sounds about right............sounds like a typical money hungry corpration.
if YouTube fucks with me when I start my channel I'm gonna be really FUCKING pissed off. #WTFU
I Guarantee You Joe That People Do This Because Of Hate And They Try To Get You In Trouble For No Reason But I Love Your Vids
A fucking men joe
what is there besides YouTube to upload videos that's better.
"There are people who don't like Angryjoe, but how can non fans not like this video? This is gold."
"this is so fucked up, I bet no one from Youtube has yet commented anything"
"dude fuck Youtube and all conglomerate money grubber companies, I will still keep watching your videos"
Shut the fuck up and get a REAL JOB
Mr.Atmos This is his job.
Abdul Wahab no its Not!! Does he pay tax like the rest of us hard working folks? No!!!
What makes you think he doesnt pay taxes on what he earns on youtube? Youtube sends out w2s like any other job.
 @MrButakal123  says guy who probably work as janitor in school
 @MrButakal123  Follow your American Dream and maybe you won't have to slave your life away working normal underpaid jobs like the rest of us people. Don't be a dick because Joe gets to make a living doing this and you don't.
i am witj u
"i agree...randoms ppl just report the copyright thingy in the SAMETIME n i am like wtf,wht did i done to u guys?i am new"
"what's next ? we will need permission from every engineer, game developer, janitor , recording software developer, ISP, keyboards and mice manufacturer,... to upload a single freakin' gameplay with no music or gun sounds cause the designers of those in-game weapons could complain about using sounds of their guns."
"What the Hell happened? GOOGLE Happened, 2008. Right after they bought YouTube, they BANNED our 16,000,000 primary Channel w/o explanation. Period. No response to our inquiries. We've been trying to warn people about YouTube ever since, but almost no one listens until they see it with their own eyes."
#WTF
This video has been claimed by Sony Computer Entertainment due to the visual present of PS4 on the background.
I'm a small time streamer on Twitch and viewers have wondered if I would ever consider uploading my content and streams to YouTube. To that I say HELL NO! My videos would be taken down immediately if I were to do that. YouTube's copyright Content ID system is fucking bullshit!
Are these claims still on his/your videos?
I agree
Also I love the dirty ass room comments Joe!! I think it's hilarious that a green screen makes it all better to Joe:) Clean your house you F*N pig!! lolz jk It reminds in the first Rocky when he's yelling at Mickey about how scared he is to fight Apollo in so many in words. It's his only chance to better himself or leave some short of legacy..But he refers to his apartment stinking like 3 times in a 2 minute scene lmao..I thought the same thing then. Dufuq does that have to do with your current dilemma lolz So funny
His eyes are almost as cashed as mine xD
we need a new website maybe everyone migrate to daily motion?
Somebody needs to make a new website like YouTube that is fair
"It says you CAN use their material for those reasons. (don't want to 
type so much). It does NOT say you won't have to deal with the system. 
Look, you use their stuff, they still have a right to fight with you 
about things. A huge misconception about fair use. But yes, you chose to
 be a content creator, you chose to be an entertainer using other 
people's work. Therefore, you too, suffer like Hollywood/gaming 
industries have to suffer too. You share in their suffering. South Park 
got sued over the ""What What In The Butt"" parody, won over fair use... 
but still, the copyright holder still had the right to sue and file a 
claim. Its just part of the game man. It says you have a right to use 
their stuff to make your videos, but it says NOTHING about 
THEM.............. NOT being able to give you a hard time about it. Grow
 up and just deal with it. Its the way of the business man. Its just the
 way it is.

Really, does it say anywhere they have no right to file claims against you? No it does not. So you use their stuff, fair use. Okay. But they also have a right to file a claim. Fair use. Its just the way of the business. Content creators on YouTube need to grow up and face the facts.

So now that you are in their game, you suffer in their game just as they have to. Why shouldn't you? Example: What makes you any better than south park? They also deal with claims and lawsuits. What makes you so special that you should not? If you win, great, there will be times some will lose. Its just the way the business is."
Someone should create a new YouTube so we all can go there.
"YouTube just thinks they can do anything with their power. They are just gold diggers. Channels like Watchmojo and TheRichest have been deleted because they are using clips and pictures from games or movies. How about the gaming channels? They are using ""Copyrighted""stuff right? They don't have permission to use it. But the people that make videos people actually enjoy are being flagged and blocked. YouTube is becoming more and more fucked up. Same with YouTube Red. They are asking you to pay for videos. They are just fucked up. And every channel that talks shit about YouTube gets flagged or removed, because they can't handle hate."
"I suppose one needs to be an expert in copyright law, the more that one is involved on their YouTube channel(s) with posting music, movies, etc.  Personally, I'm just trying to educate myself, day by day, bit by bit in this arena.  And worse case scenario, if a channel is ever taken down, what's to stop someone from starting a new channel, and uploading all their old stuff, etc. (and making new stuff)?  I mean, what acts would bar someone from YouTube for life???"
"We tried this over 8 years ago. If you try a New Account, they just ban the account in mid download, or they ban it shortly after the videos are done uploading."
"Yeah...  From what I've seen on YouTube videos about the subject, there are so many, many things that just DON'T hold a candle to copyright violation...  Instant termination of an account...  GREAT difficulty in getting everything reinstated...  Probably one of the top 3 things people hate the most about YouTube..."
I feel for you man. I really dont know what the situation is now. You're the only youtuber that I actually dont treat as background noise mate.Hang in there
slimboyfat45 The situation got even worse.
Why the fuck would you flag a top 10 games of a 2mill sub ?!?!?!
"after listening to Angry Joe's rant about the copyright system I starting to imagine a Video called
"" Order 66 but every jedi is replaced with a youtuber icon and Emperor Palpatine and the Republic clone troopers are youtube. ""

That perfectly sums up how youtube back stabbed our youtubers which we love."
History is repeating itself...
Fucking Tubetters Claimed some part of my video Which is originally made by me..and who the fuck is this tubetters..i am just starting my youtube channel i am not famous but if this is gonna happened then we(small youtubers) will never gonna able to produce more cool contents..
"This is so fucking shit. One of my videos completely, absolutely follows the fair use criteria, and yet my ""dispute wasn't approved"" And they said, ""if you send in another one, your account could get a copyright strike"" Lmaooo WTFFF????? What a joke. What am I supposed to do???? I know what fair use is, I know how to follow fair use. So it's not like I'm in the wrong here. If they didn't approve it the first time how am I supposed to send in another one without risk?? What is this? A way to sabotage small youtubers? Fuck YouTube."
you didnt create the content that you use so get a grip mate
"Now to me I wish they would acknowledge people like me who love to make AMVS I still think they are ""Fair Use"" because we are doing something new to the song and making it our own. But if we just post the song ONLY thats pirating. AMVS are not like that at all! Were creating something new to the thing or song that we are doing. Guess I'm screwed from doing what I love. (I just wish I can do something that I love without being screwed)"
did youlickmy@$$tube remove their shit though ?
youtube blocked angry reviews @_@ this is war ! :|
I'm new at YouTube aswell so this sucks
"It's been 3 years.

Youtube...Youtube never changes."
For free songs without copyrights subscribe to my channel
find a lawyer that is willing to take on a class action lawsuit
a computer does not know about fair use
True. A computer only knows what it's programmed to know
take these companies to court that  are giving you problems
"I've been saying it over and over: the reason Youtube doesn't give a shit about fixing their issues is there are no repercussions for not doing anything.  Right now, they're the only medium that we have to watch people we support like Angry Joe.  If these guys were to leave en masse and move to another service like vid.me, Youtube will take notice and do something since that would hurt them where it counts, in their wallets."
IHE x Daddy Derek
angry Joe your right and I believe that!!!
"YouTube are some true tards...truly fucking stupid...so basically a user has been stealing my videos and using my footage..Their shitty network then submits MY FUCKING VIDEO to content ID, and I GET A COPYRIGHT CLAIM for the video that was STOLEN FROM ME...fuck you youtube"
Viral Killer YouTube has fucked up alot Idk what to say There criminals not us YOUTUBE FIX YOUR SHIT STOP MAKING POINTLESS UPDATES
Damn thats messed up!
Joe Rogans having that problem too. Since his live show runs 2 or 3 hours usually they SPAM clips from it and post them while he's still streaming. Stream ends and he goes to upload it and copyright strike hits his channel lol
"Well, Google, (whose parent company is actually Alphabet Inc.) owns Youtube. ""Youtube"" ceased to exist in 2006, it has been ""Gootube"" for the past 10 years. All they care about is revenue, not the content creators. They sucked in people with partnerships and monetization, and now are swooping in for the kill."
I hope IGN gets more blocks than this channel
RPsonicfan they don’t know how to review a game series and don’t ever say a character that is a fan favorite
THE ONLY FUCKING SHIT YOUTUBE EVER CARES ABOUT.
Check out Ethan Klein's (h3h3productions) company called FUPA ---- Fair Use Protection Account
Someone did a false caim on my Michael Jackson video when I've used Sailor Moon OST when he can't even read the note and I was so mad at the person seriously YouTube? and that video was a tribute to Michael but this foolish punk did that I want him banned from everysite and youtube fix this after all that hardwork I did to make that video it goes down the drain.
"I got a copyright claim on my SMB video, and me reacting to a bee movie edit! WHAT THE HECK?!?!?!?"
"+PigPigGamer, I got a copyright claim on my full instrumental of a T&F episode, WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!?"
Fuck the copyright bullshit and let everyone upload the Fuck they want for FFS the music is in a game like WWE 2k18 ffs fuck google and give billionaires the fucking money this is bullshit 😠😡😡😡😡😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
For some reason this reminds me of Francis
"""I don't even have money in my wallet..... Yes I do I have 7 dollars "" 😂😂😂"
I laughing my ass off when he was throwing his money at the camera lol.
I know getting angry and yelling is AJ's thing but damn this video is dead serious. he seems like he was at a breaking point.
im just here because of crowbcat's vídeo about vídeo game awards xD
That 7 dollar scene will live on in meme history
Raptor Badger haven't seen any memes of it. Can you send me a link to some?
This is too serious to be considered a meme. This was a statement
"the retarded problem here is the copyright claims are trawled by bots not people, its an algorithm from programs looking at content. bots cant differentiate between fair use policy or actual legitimate claims."
Man I know how you feel YouTube's been getting on my ass
If i use font from dafont i will get chance to get copyright?
this is Joe's greatest rant of all time
this is really killing new youtubers i cant do any fucking thing smh
"yeah... im a small channel with almost 300 videos but I constantly have to put up with these copyright claims. honestly im kinda scared to post a lot of content because of youtubes copyright system.. I got a lot of false copyright claims to, one saying my pokemon x and y berry farming was spam when it was titled correctly and had all the tags correct on it to. hell ive had some more problems to, when I uploaded a video it seems like people would unsub to me when I made a new vid and uploaded it and I cant understand why that happened. sigh... idk if my channel will ever grow. I sure hope it does but at the same time im scared of copyright claims screwing up my channel..."
***** whats the new algorithm? can you explain a little bit?
"***** hmmm... I hope I don't lose my subs, youtube needs to fix this. someone like pewdiepie has a better chance at getting the message across to youtube because of the amount of subs he has and because hes one of the most well known people on youtube. I been on youtube for a very very long time and ill tell ya... its nothing like it was before. im also getting false copyrights to. its just getting really bad. if I keep losing subs then my channel will never get anywhere and I really don't wanna resort to twitch.."
happy 3 year anniversary nazi youtube ayy lmao
same problem
"You can click the ""dispute""  button, just in case rage has taken over intelligent brains."
Read upload dates

2016 lol
Anyone here from Crowbcat game awards 2016?
4 k disslikes come from youtube
"It's even worse now! I can't watch AMVs, anime fact videos, etc. now! I can't even watch my favorite videos anymore. Even though they're still ""up"" on YT, they're BLOCKED in my damn country. I'm stuck in the UNITED STATES OF FUCKING AMERICA, where the Copyright Gods rule with an iron fist. YT, if you see this, fuck you. Let us watch our favorite videos! I can literally write a 1000 page NOVEL about all of your fuck ups. We have no rights to ""Broadcast Ourselves"" anymore. Stop crying over the littlest things. Flagging videos that just have certain clips from media, not the whole damn movie, show, etc., is stupid, especially if they credited the creators. If I had any videos that were flagged, for the dumbest reasons, I would have a lovely rant all put together for you. Fuck you, and fix yourselves"
"Now in 2017, ..making money off content that is not yours, is now harder to make. In fact, things are getting worse because large corporations think that if any real money is made, it should be made theirs and not yours."
This all traces to the FIRST AMENDMENT YOUTUBE! get your HEAD OUTTA YOUR ASS
Damn this was years ago. The youtube shit just got worse
Profited? Wtf is he talking about?Youtubers make tins of money from youtube. Literally every c or lower least actor and every moron that focuses on drama make thousands per month when youtube is literally in the red zone.......Wtf pissed Jose
Clearly you live under a rock if that's what you think
"RayRoFid I don't really care for pissed Jose's money.
A lazy ass that complaints that doesn't make enough. Why doesn't he try to find a real job? Oh wait he has no skills. Every society reject found a job on YouTube and when they make a lot of money they start bitching......especially pissed jose shouldn't talk. his content blows"
"If you don't care for Jose's money complaining then it's fine, but that's not the problem. Jose isn't the only one affected. 
Millions of people are affected by this. Jose just seem to say what we all think.
As to Jose finding a 'real job', it's really none of your business since he has the right to do what the fuck he wants as long he's not commiting a serious crime.

What you said wasn't fair anyway. ""Every society reject found a job on YouTube and when they make a lot of money they start bitching.....""
Alot of people work very hard for their channels and to suddenly be copyrighted for something so bullshit is unacceptable."
"RayRoFid No pissed Jose doesn't say what everyone is thinking. I think youtubers are paid quite well. They have no schedule. Their content quality mostly declines and their enthusiasm stops after they get bigger. However the payments stay the same.
in youtuber quality isn't synonymous with payment. I support hard work. not no good drama bums"
"Thank you. Someone agrees with my opinion that ""Angry"" Joe sucks as a content creator. This piss ant knew the risks of doing YouTube for a full-time job and then whines and bitches when people want to protect their IPs and other properties. Why do you think I stick to podcasting? It's easy, fun and doesn't run afoul to Content ID."
Pirate says FUCK OFF.. you don't know shit..
THIS GUY IS FUCKING RIGHT AND ITS ALMOST BEEN 3 YEARS AND YOU DUNE NOTHING YOU NEED TO FUCKING STAND UP AND STOP DOING BULLSHIT ABOUT COPYRIGHT GROW UP YOUTUBE GROW THE FUCK UP
start a new tube
if it wasn't  for the public pics they would not exist.
"I've just got a copyright strike too, on making a narrative of the Magic of Thinking Big on my own."
3 years ago
"Since Public Domain Content on another channel of mine got multiple claims of i don´t know what companies i gave up with Youtube. Why support them. I rather support every pirate out there than upload anything worth while to youtube anymore. If i upload something it took me no effort at all. Big Guys like Joe or Totalbiscuit can fight back, but ""fun"" channels which just friends watch have no chance at all."
hay I subscribed you now please subscribe me and share my video and make me also little famous please
my firend made a video and i lisend to 50 cent and he goted 1 coperite strike and i diden't make a video wtf youtube fuck off🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕👎👎👎👎👎👎
"Thank you, we all need to be making videos about our experiences with this copyright issue, I will be creating one very soon myself."
"And for how much he bitches about youtube, yeah, he's still around. Once again, an hypocrite."
CastelDawn well youtube is his job
"you wouldn't like YOUR material to be used by other people without authorization, stop being an hypocrite."
Man you are more lost than 5 year boy in corn field
"if every youtuber stopped acting like money hungry assholes and stopped putting ads in their videos then you would start seeing a difference from YouTube. if all of u guys came together and just stopped making them money for just one month, you'll see a fucking difference. I'm not saying you're wrong, I understand, just get up and do something about it instead creating a rant video which isn't gonna change anything"
"Nope, because YouTube can monetize videos without the consent of the content creator."
inb4 this gets flagged and the person who claimed it is named JOE.
"Watching these older vids you feel so bad for Joe and others and hope it works out, now he's even in vids playin games with Chloe Moretz!, glad it worked out for you Joe!"
"I just uploaded the next part for my Battlefront 2 walkthrough, and one of the songs in the video made it unable to watch in 243 COUNTRIES. WTF Youtube"
"This makes me worry about even having content with fair use in it. Great rant though, watched the whole thing!"
"I got a claim from IDOL claiming my Shovel Knight video claiming its music. This is a company that has an auto claim system that will claim videos hoping that smaller youtubers wont dispute and take their possible profits. I wont back down to this, I wont stand by and be a victim to this. How are smaller youtubers supposed to grow when stuff like this is allowed? This whole system is flawed to all hell. We can't let this continue. Keep on keeping on Joe, we cant fall to this."
YouTube heroes 😂
"they take all the eggs out of the hen, then they kill it. perfect analogy for content creators and youtubers. amirite?"
Found this videos because apparently all of my videos have copyright problems and have ads despite the fact that they're all trashy Spore GA vids.
welcome to Youtube. It sucks but it is their sandbox. Yes I know this video is three years old
nothing's changed.
"DO YOU KNOW THAT I JOINED YOUTUBE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY JOB I CAN DO SINCE I'M 14!? DO YOU KNOW THAT MY MOM HAD 0 JOB AND MY BROTHER IS STILL IN TRAINING AND WE'RE BEING CHASED BY BILLS AND LOAN SHARKS!?!? IF YOUTUBE WAS LIKE THIS EVERYDAY, YOU RUINED OUR LIFE!!! I WOULD BE A HOBO EVERYDAY!



 IF I WERE PRESIDENT OF YOUTUBE I WILL KILL FAKE COPYRIGHT PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE! SKIP THAT JAIL THING, KILL NOW.
IF I WERE PRESIDENT OF YOUTUBE I WILL KILL CLICKBAIT VIDEOS, REMOVE THE SPAM, KILL GAMING COMPANIES' BROKEN COPYRIGHT SYSTEM, WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE CAN I DO IF I WERE CEO OF YOUTUBE?"
"ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO THE YOUTUBE STAFF. IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE FEW PEOPLE, DON'T DO YOUTUBE HEROES, HIRE US!!!! YOU CAN'T DO THAT? YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU WANT ALL MONEY ON YOURSELF AND NOT ON HUNGRY STARVING POOR HOBOS!

I'M TELLING YOU, DON'T MAKE ANYTHING LIKE YOUTUBE HEROES OR WORSE, HIRE US!"
The Stackin' Minecraft - MCPE the fuck?
YouTube has changed...
"I keep getting copyright strikes from fucken INgroove. Even if I give proper credit and even put the proof that I can post this video without any copyright infringement This INgroove is pissing me off. This is what was put in my Description 

 -Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for ""fair use"" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Now how the fuck can thy just do that to not just a small youtuber like me but to others like this....

I call bull sht."
also i can download the new Alter Bridge songs cuz of this
Greedy people make the wold an awful place. My opinion.
I think that Youtube eventually will change because of enough of rants about the copyright-issue.  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I read news about Youtube eventually calming down about the whole copyright-use.
"YOUTUBE NEEDS TO SHAPE THE FUCK UP WITH THE COPYRIGHT NONSENSE.  EVERYONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO UPLOAD WHATEVER THEY WANT (Fan-made videos, movies, so on: AS LONG AS THEY GIVE CREDIT TO THE CREATORS!"
I wish I could like this video 20 times
well I just started 1 week ago and I already have gotten a copyright claim I think I'm gonna make a rant because I'm gonna blow up
Baxneus I subbed
And you're NOT interested in money huh joe? XD c'mon
Curious if anyone knows how to make amvs without getting a strike. Need tips.
abe sale tera kya jata hai gadhe..
Studio71_2_1   Random company just monetized my Typhoon video I filmed from my home.
patreon is a good way to go seen more youtubers using it and im support that to 100%
I wanted this year to put a gameplay gta 4 lost and damned and you tube still do this FUCK YOU YOU TUBE by the way joe big fan of you
copyright MY ASS
Just watch this because one of my video got copyrighted. You what the worst? The people that copyrighted isn't the original content or even the maker of the musics and i didn't find any conten on their channel related what they copyrighted. Tf youtube
"I'm a channel with 6 subscribers and got a copyright strike on a Tomb Raider Let's Play. No monetisation at all on these videos. Someone called ""Epic Music VN"" from Vietnam claims they OWN (lol) the visual content of the intro cinematic. How is this even possible?!

This is my first week as a serious Youtuber and I've already have to deal with this shit…"
Cyber bullying and cyber suicide has increased because of the false YouTube Copyright strikes. YouTube CEOs should burn in hell for hurting innocent people!
"Mr.ScaryPasta I have an idea to stop cyber bullying and cyber suicide.





TURN OFF THE FUCKING COMPUTER!"
Mr.ScaryPasta it’s a business u people really don’t get it
Etika is a great example
Screams a lot!!! next singer for system of a down founded peeps! :DD
YouTube needs some competition
#youtube is a stupid bitch
"YouTube is all bout that money, and it's dumb and stupid."
"This video is so funny at speed x2 especially the 5:05 part, speed x0,5 also work for this part xD"
Chi Cha it starts at 5:06.
"Updated comment: alot of people confuse a strike with a notice. When you get a content ID match thing it's just the claimant knows their music is being used and they can put ads on your videos.If the music is in the game, the game doesn't own the rights to the music always. They just own the license to use the music in the game. Not going to lie YouTube's copyright system is messed up, on a channel I had before they nearly gave me a strike on a video where I made up something funny.  It was automatically flagged and I had to delete it so I don't get a copyright strike. Like Seriously, I made that up ( what I said in the video) how could it have possibly been copyrighted?!"
well said man
if joe shows stop im gonna fight them 2
this was in 2013 lol check your dates
Still though but he is doing fine now right or nah
when my videos music even a link it got copyrighted makes me pissed!
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Turnabout YouTube Copyright make it happen CAPCOM!
"Content ID = Apocalypse ascending
Youtube Heroes = Apocalypse ARRIVED!"
And the YouTube Heroes rant's pretty much the Pt 2 to this one. YT's decision there might be even worse than this trainwreck and that's saying some shit
"7:52

After he said ""I'm waiting"" my video buffered. No joke."
It's kinda strange seeing Joe genuinely angry as opposed to the comical over exaggerated anger we see in normal videos
"Im sad about this man, this was legit anger and frustration, I know im 2 years later but.... this still makes me feel bad for him"
dON''T GET TO SERIOUS...THEY ARE STUPID MOTHER KAKA
Two words: YouTube Heroes. FML
quit bitchin man u make hella money sitting on ur ass playing videos games! don't see me wining for makin minimum wage being a slave to a business so fuck you! hahaha
Actually it was proven that he does not make money from this so if you're bitching because you're only getting chump change at McDonalds it must mean you're too stupid to be qualified for anything else! hahaha
cant earn if they take your videos away work it out
thank you joe its true we small channel always get copyright i had 5 video copyright i just upload a tutorial video in the video a music is playing i did'nt even edit the video i just play the music on my browser youtube and they i just upload it the copyright strick for using the music im just hearing the music
its only gotten worse :(
"Youtubers are complaining all over, start ""JoeTube"" and they´ll all move to your platform."
YouTube isn't YouTube anymore. It's owned by Google now. YouTube was great before Google bought it
"google has owned youtube since 2006, the year it was created. So that's counterintuitive. Blame modern Google"
"Kappa that is 100% Pepsi Close, but no cigar. YouTube was founded in 2005. YouTube was at first, an independent website that got really popular very fast. Then, one year later, Google bought it."
And that's why I hate Google
that is why I failed to start my channel
59:00 yes more bonus reviews like a bonus DLC
Ok that's enough internet for today 💀
I bought the game at $60 dollars. I left for a few years and came back and played with a few friends and enjoyed it. I re-downloaded it and I'm going to give a good fair try again. Bethesda has been a huge favorite for me and i always want to try and give them the benefit of the doubt but you guys definitely nailed it.
No one is watching your streams fat boi del
"Fallout 76 is still going strong... so yeah, not really the disaster you thought it would be."
"""strong"" is an interesting way of putting it. More like ""holding on for dear life"" waiting for Amazon to release new seasons of the show."
I miss Dell. You could tell he put a lot of hours into these terrible games and his insight was great on what the problems were
"Same here, I remember he made a new channel but I don't know the name, nor do I really bother since it's been 6 years."
"I played the game in 2025. I won't talk about bugs here — just one oversight that negatively impacts the gameplay.

Reloading your weapon is mapped to the R key.

Looting all nearby enemies is also mapped to the R key.

During longer firefights (fortunately, there aren't too many — ha!), you might move your cursor over a freshly fallen enemy and instinctively hit R to reload. But instead of reloading, the game opens the looting interface for nearby items dropped by enemies. That's not great."
"In hindsight now, which is worse starfield or 76?"
"30:40 - Bro, straight up. I actually did this. I roleplayed as a Chef in the game who made these recipes which were difficult to make and time consuming. I chucked them into my store to be sold. You know what happened? NO ONE BOUGHT THEM. Bruh, no one is going to buy your spoiling food when like dogsteak or whatever is good enough. There's literally no incentive to do this to begin with. And this alone is a good enough proof that the people at Bethesda aren't experienced in RPGs."
"Can we sign a petition or something to get Fallout away from Bethesda? For real, they can't write a good Hardcore RPG. Fallout 5 will be an Action Fantasy Wasteland if Bethesda makes it. I guarantee it. They'll explain this magic away by describing it as something scientific. But essentially, it'll just be magic.

They DO NOT care about the world and lore of Fallout. This is why even the TV show is inconsistent. Fallout is basically a walking corpse of what it once was. They'll keep using Fallout so long as it's providing money for them. Why do you think Fallout 5 will release in 2030? I am willing to bet it's because they want to postpone the Fallout New Vegas Remaster for as long as possible. They can't write for crap and Fallout New Vegas will expose that."
"Game now is still boring af! Lazy story writing! Lazy design! this game is still trash , your trash too if your defending bethesda!"
"Six years later.... yep, Bethesda still making $$$ on fo76. 😂😂😂"
Game is good today !
I wanna know if Joe or Del have played F76 recently.  I’d love for him to re review it and no man’s sky
30:40 I think about this story way too often
i miss the angry and these kind of sitdown reviews 😢😢
"I finally gave 76 a chance recently just before 2025. And it is actually fun and the graphics are good. There are very occasionally still a few bugs or crashes. The community is very friendly. Still not a huge fan of the inventory management with running out of storage space at my camp or being over encumbered, but that’s always been a gripe of mine no matter the game.
But it’s still doesn’t excuse coming out with an unfinished product at launch. It shouldn’t happen."
Glad that fat guy isn't working for you anymore.   Really spoils the video.  Not a nice character.
What gun did Del get that did that much damage?
BOOOOORRRRRIIIIIINNG GAME
47:22 so it's 2025 and Fallout 76 still isn't free. Looks like Mr Beard was completely wrong.
1 minute to 2 minutes load times? that is even worse than sonic 06 whose load times are 50 seconds maximum and 40 seconds minimum and what makes that even worse is that fallout 76 is taking that long to load such small areas whereas sonic 06 has larger maps to load with more objects and entities to load as well and it doesn't take that long hell you could watch the ridiculously long metal madness transformation from sonic heroes and it still won't be done and that is saying something
I haven’t played this game I heard it was just a live service fallout 4 and I don’t even like fallout 4…. the story is bad and I know it’s suppose to have a post apocalyptic setting but it’s just so lifeless compared to FO3 and NV.
"I'm working on a pixel game engine and game right now and I can tell you with 99% certainty that the number of people who can handle working in a game engine like that and do what they do, dealing with all the different hardware from cross platform, different chip sets, Integrated and external GPUs, etc. is absolutely not many.  they may have thousands of employees, but I doubt there's more than a few who can iron out all the different driver and compatibility bugs for their engine.  it's just there's so much you need to know and keep track of.  I'll bet they've got tons of code that no one can even remember writing or how it works by now."
But it's good now!
While I agree some responses to the election have been a bit much. The takes in this video are actually insane to be making and are extremely ill informed. Sad to see.
What the fuck are you talking about? Are you on drugs?
"All these years since Fallout 4, we got this, 5/6 years ago, and now, Starfield, trash, don't you love gaming and how long they take to make Rubbish nowadays."
"I’m from the future, and I want to tell you about Starfield…"
16 times the failure.
Joe has gotten so much better the last few years at not talking over people compared to times like this. Im proud of the guy.
"Should’ve been a 1/10 

Because 7 - 6 = 1"
"I have went back to Fallout after the show and 4 got me hooked. I bought 76 for $12 and returned it once I found out you need PS plus. I’m glad they patched up and added some stuff, but requiring a network connection is fucking dumb"
"Ya, your right, how fuckin dare a online only game, require online."
"It's guys like you that keep Channel Awesome, well, awesome. Y'all know how to keep it real. Btw Joe, fellow Texan here, been a fan for over a decade!"
"5 years later, F76 is REALLY cheap, $15. The only rightful way to check it out if you're curious. Unless you got it for free off PS+, like I did. I heard you can join the Enclave, I'll try that if its true."
Joe should review Fallout 76 again after all the updates and with the TV Series hype.
Show got way better without del...
Wrong
I’ll say the game is now a 7 after 6 years later worth of patches and updates. 💀 Tho some of the bugs still remain.
"the game is fun with friends but as a new player to the game I felt so annoyed with the stashes and constantly finding Stem packs, relying on crafting, it just felt like a chore for me, I was so lost. I felt like I could've put my time in a better MMO"
"2023: Spoiler, they used the same god damn engine for Starfield.
2027: Spoiler, they used the same god damn engine for Fallout 5
2031: Spoiler, they used the same god damn engine for Elder Scrolls 6
2035: Spoiler, they used the same god damn engine for Elder Scrolls 6 Brain Implant Deluxe Remastered Edition
2036: All good, Ai have taken over and found a way to travel back in time to warn you. Greetings traveller. :stopwatch-blue-hand-timer:"
34:30 30:40
"The only acceptable price was 8 bucks for 76. It's biggest problem outside of what you mentioned is its nonexistent story. No idea what I'm supposed to passed the camp set up, which is a huge mess."
"it's 2024 and fallout 76 is not free, so the other Joe was right -)"
You guys should do an updated discussion on fallout 76 especially since it’s gone to game pass basically free to play.
I’d say the game now is a 5. 6 if you got it for free.
Thank you Joe !!!!! Awesome video you can change the title to starfield and release it again lol
Welp. Sorry Joe from the past. Starfield was in fact on the same engine and it was shit.
What happened to del
He eventually got overtaken by his beard.
"I read on reddit that it was either to do with 
Lollie shit, furrie shit, or ped-o stuff"
Starfield actually looks like it 😂😂😂😂😂
Fall out 76 is an awesome game. Great times.
5 years later the game is still going and sometimes when you try to join a world it's full. Most new players seem to love it.
"I just tried it Yesterday for like 4 hours, it sucked lol"
"Never seen a full world and I played it for a few months last year and this year. Same old cycle of go here,kill,loot, do a quest by killing and no unique ways to solve quest,go to turn in quest or just finish quest after killing and repeat. Same as boring Fallout 4. Bethesda isn't good at hiding the basic game mechanics like Obsidian and Interplay were with their Fallout games. Fallout 3 was only saved by Bethesda playing it safe and copying Fallout 1 and 2 while being in 3d and not turn based. They watered down the mechanics and choices so much while making it a building game and a game that wants to be many things at once while not being great at what Fallout is known for, choice and consequences with multiple ways to solve quests or other mysteries like with New Vegas. F4 and F76 can be enjoyed for only so long before the loop just blatantly becomes obvious and becomes boring. It's dependent on the person for how long it will take and if they are a a new player to the franchise or not. Someone that's new to the games might really enjoy it but someone who has played since Fallout 1 or Fallout 3 will more than likely not enjoy it due to how those games have so many choices and hides the loop that every game has."
I just got my copy of 76 for $8 😂😂
Still not free to play. Lil joe was right.
Game pass
Just wait till these guys play Star Field lol.
Got it for $10 in 2023 after all the free updates and it’s worth it. I feel bad for launch day adopters
This game has come a long way and you guys should give it another shot with a new review?
Does the final boss still scale? I know all other enemies scale.
"Watching back I actually agree with Other Joe a lot more.  He is right, Fallout 4 looked way better.  Not because of resolution/color but because of the level of detail and time they took to place each individual item in the world.  Fallout 76 felt extremely rushed.  Like someone in the Fallout 4 Settlements system did all the details of the world."
"Coming back 4 years later..... game still broken, and Starfield is not impressive at all. Microsoft get rid of the Creation engine."
Watching in 2023. I wonder.. which dev actually gets it right now? I've payed through remnant 2 and was so impressed. But the huge Devs are a shit show right now. Don't get me started on starfield
"4:05 boy how wrong we were
Elder Scrolls 6 will be broken and buggy still"
33:00 this turret issue still works 4 years later i can confirm
"55:00, Joe was right about human NPCs. They didn't belive that, but Joe did. But, anyways, Joe is done with the game, at least not ""done done""."
"It's a good game now, so no need to be angry any longer."
Stop it's still boring with no end game
"went back to it like 6 months ago and it still kinda sucks, 76 can not be saved"
I hope your not buying anything in the shop at least... may god save your soul
This looks like its dels first tine seeing another himan being irl
The Starfield comment at the beginning has aged like a fine wine.
More like a grape that was left out on the counter 😂
They end up creating a subscription model instead of free 😂
"no lie. this game is the worst thing i have ever seen on my screen. lol the bugs and nonsense list is truly endless.. lol and every ""update"" brings more idiotic problems. no clue what the main story is about. all u do in this game is collect fkn plants and putting em in a basket that sometimes don't even spawn. perk cards not working lol its fkn endless its issue after issue after issue. its fkn unplayable. if you're braindead ull love this game.. lol ""30% chance u get double result when crafting anything"" lol 10 x 2 =13 max 14 ask bethesda. big 🖕2 em. never again any of their products. fkn TROLLS"
Nope
 @jegjrtp87  pls tell me u are trolling me
 @thelawless1-n3v  nope
 @jegjrtp87  my goodness..😞
"4 years after, well OJ was right about not turning free, and well, I'm not sure how broke it for you AJ, but bethesda is already EA for a bit I'm afraid."
what is the outro song?
"43:40 he mentioned elder scroll 6, it's been 4 years and we have no further information about this game."
"Wow I can’t believe joe would lie us about giving it a 2 out 10 he most certainly give it an 3 out 10.
😊😮😅"
Awesome!!!! Look forward to more
"11:49 ""this is unplayable"", but the moment the lawsuit comes up 13:15 ""I was able to play this one"". Keep supporting Bethesda Joe"
"I heard people are finally getting the canvas bag they were supposed to get. Only 4 years after this video was posted. hahahaha

Fallout 76 ALSO went ""Free to Play"" before they could get rid of the physical discs! 

Stores were literally GIVING AWAY copies of Fallout 76 with any purchase just to get rid of their on-hand units. 😂

F*ck anyone who still has hope for Bugthesda's next game in 2023. They're going to get what they deserve. The combat looks THE SAME HAHAHAHAHA"
"So I stand on this opinion, not that I’m expecting anyone to see this in 2023. 

Starfield can probably fail and it wouldn’t hurt Bethesda’s reputation too much since it’s a new IP. But if ES6 fails, they are absolutely fucked"
"I disagree people have been hyping up for Starfeild for year, it definitely made them lose fans. Es6 will kill the company though if it sucks"
"I turned on auto update on steam, and Fallout 76 got updated... So I decided to take a look around to remind me why I stopped playing this game... Thank you AJS... I remember having a lot of issues with the game, not itself, but technically, the AI, no endgame.... PvP is usually pretty bad in games that aren't exclusively PvP games; this game made it even worse (I didn't think it was possible)... This hour long review from 4 years ago allowed me the time to decide to disable auto update again.... =D"
The next Fallout game might as well be given to another studio that can put the love and passion back into the community.
"Even the concept of 'the endgame' being the tail-end of every game, some games are (meant) to be great tales told well, that end. Instead of patiently waiting for the next announcement as we all drift to other games we wanted to try....

...no! Stay here and enjoy 'the endgame' ! Spin your wheels, collect the loot and stay jacked-in to our product ! 🤤"
"Been a few years now, just wondering if I can unwrap my bundled copy of '76 ?

😂"
"2k people disagree with this? wow, delusional."
"Years later,Bethesda has gone from an epic company to one who will throw out cheap,annoying games for a quick buck!
Remember Commander Kean?
The idea of a modern version of a classic game like that was amazing!
The trailer looked amazing and I was so excited to see what this game would be like!
...And it was a cheap PAY TO WIN MOBILE GAME!
When I saw that I said this game would not be talked about in a year!
...And i was right!"
"So it's January 2023. Fallout 76 has become ""free-to-play"" for PlayStation as part of the free monthly games. Still haven't brought myself to play it tho but I'm probably going to give it a shot now just because it's free and hopefully patched. Still disappointed it didn't come out ready. Missed opportunity"
January 2023 it's free to play and that's still too expensive to make me play this game again. Bethesda will have to pay me to play this game. Such a shame as I loved other fallout games. Bethesda you done fucked up man
"4 years later I bought the game for 10 USD, and Del was right, so far I only discovered one other vault aside from 76. Vault 51, and all the residents inside are dead, the vault being taken over by the scorched, I mean ghouls? I mean burnt raiders? Whatever they are, Del's prediction was on the money.

Regarding some performance FPS issues, the rig I have is not a slouch but not a NASA super computer by any means.
 it's got a I-5 processor and a GTX 1070TI and a solid state drive.

And I've seen FPS drops like 15 FPS in combat with mild amount of NPC's."
"I decided to rewatch this video now to see what has changed since this review:
4 YEARS STILL BROKEN

Stash is now 1200 weight and still basically unplayable without fallout 1st cause almost every item weights 10-20 lbs each

There is still no end game 
Daily ops is literally daily crash to desktop mostly just before the end boss spawns
Daily ops is 2 game modes that is almost 90 % similar the only ""variety"" is mutated enemies

Theres more effort and creativity in this comment section then Fallout 76. lol
Theres more effort and creativity in this comment section then Fallout 76. lol
I tried playing for a hour today andddddd  yup this is the worst fallout ever
I will say the game is much better now. But AJ was completely justified for going in on the state of the game at launch. I play it through game pass now and am thoroughly enjoying at 4 years later
"""I don't wanna fuckin feed people I'll feed them nukes"""
"Based on this game and also Fallout 4 a little bit, I REALLY don't trust Bethesda to come through on ES6."
Just went to check - Fallout 76 is still £35 on steam...what the fuq
I'm REALLY looking forward to the Starfield review!
"Other Joe was right, it never went F2P"
"anyone remember when cinematic cutscene trailers alone would get you hyped?

Now they dont even register to me.. im almost put off and disinterested when they show ONLY cinematics and it seems like they blew a fortune on it.. & show not a stitch of gameplay..

that last one i think that got me hyped was a Diablo 3 trailer like 100 yrs ago.."
"Oof.. Starfield actually does look like Fallout76. Sorry, Joe."
Ultima Online did (and still does) player economy and player housing best.
Show is much better without Del.
I quit playing Fallout 76 after just an hour. What's the point in playing it when you have players that are level 200 or higher being annoying. Only reason for a high level player like that to constantly kill a level 7 player is to grief. In 1 hour Fallout 76 had more ignorant griefers than Red Dead online and Gta online. In my experience. Fallout should stay single player with at most 2-4 player co-op. Not an MMO like 76.
Just an hour? Wow lol. I never did play 76. I wasn't interested in a mmorpg in the Fallout universe. I decided to never try it after witnessing this type of stuff. Some things should simply stay single player. There are good mmo games don't get me wrong. My personal favorite is still Ultima Online. Still going since 1997
"It’s sad to see how bad of shape this game was in when it released. Really gave it a forever bad reputation, even today considering they improved A LOT and added so many QOL updates, it’s release will always haunt it."
"How come this types of extended discussions still happen with Joe, Alex, and OJ? I love these extended discussions."
Lol fukin Del 💀💀
It is $40 right now other joe was right
Who els miss dell.. ? I do
I don't but do u know y he isn't around anymore??
" @slappydoodle  well he said he “ wanted “ to do his own thing. So last I heard he is streaming on twitch… just find it kinda odd even if it is true.,, he is never mentioned or has never come back just as a friend on the show."
"@Freakgood  yea that's kinda my thing like didn't he have his own Playlist for a sec there were he reviewed indie off shoot games I think it was called rapid fire reviews or something 
Idk weird
 appreciate u answering"
 @slappydoodle  not sure if the idea rapid fire was his.. and the AJS show still uses rapid fire review ..  feel like there is more to the story then we know. Yeah np ..
OJ seemed to be right in this situation considering fallout 76 still isn't free to play on steam (in fact they're currently charging $40)
Does anyone still play this?
"My local dollar store had fallout76 for $1. I bought all 20 copies and sold them on ebay for $10 a piece
An idiot born everyday"
"If you look it up now Walmart, Target and other retailers are still trying to sell new copies at $39"
I miss del
Same and it’s sad seeing some new comments in this video and some other videos saying they like Alex better then Del or the show is way better without Del.🤦🏽‍♂️
Do u know y he isn't around anymore? I haven't seen him on a single video in quite a while
Unfortunately I don't know. I think he wanted to focus on other content but I'm not 100% certain of it.
"He has his own channel where he plays games and reviews stuff, his channel is called Ctrl+Alt+Delrith"
@0-Acerlot-0  but who actually watches del?? Being on AJ is the only reason people even know who he is
"Yeah, true"
"2022-05-01 today so it's more than 3 years later and it's still not free to play game, although it actually came to Steam. So on steam it cost 70$ for a deluxe edition or 40$ for a regular version and it sometimes go on sale with 67% discount. Game's status is ""Mostly positive"". OJ was right when he said that it's not going to become free to play."
"Maybe lil' Todd had different friends from the rest of us, but NO Todd - you cannot design a massive open game where you expect players to contribute to the empty narrative."
"The sad part is, at this point, if it was just a standard fallout game it would be kinda awesome. Most of the issues revolve around multiplayer scaling with the world and server issues."
I pre ordered it when it first got announced cause fallout my favorite series but God it was a waste of money don't buy it
Never seen people pvp in this game 😂😂 I try so hard to like it and play but ugh.. just terrible 🤣🤣
"Late asf to comment on this video.... 1) I come back to this vid for the laughs 😂, and 2) noone wanted a semi mmo fallout, we wanted a multiplayer fallout. 4 players max,  this would've shined honestly. I want to play fallout with my friends... not randoms. Bugs and all, this game would've SHINED as a 4 player co-op game 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"I still have my Fallout 76 sitting on my shelves because Gamestop wouldn't take it back - now it reminds me to never a Bethesda game again...

Waited for Elder Scrolls 6 for years only to be greeted by remaster after remaster after remaster after remaster.... broken ass fallout 76 with micro transactions then the nerve to charge for Fallout 1st? Get the fuck outta here, burned ALL my goodwill and then some."
"I'm amazed at how many people have forgotten how bad this ripoff show was, and are now ready to preorder Starfield after some breadcrumbs of information and amnesia of how poorly they were treated as customers.  Gamers seem to be the least patient consumers around with a gluttony for punishing themselves (the shitshow that is Madden year after year for example).  You know, you can skip out on a title to teach the company a lesson with your wallet, and life will be okay. Hell, wait a year and get a game for $20.  Nope.  Fellow game fans just line up to feed these companies and allow themselves to be abused year after year. What stupidity. I hope Starfield is a shitshow as well, maybe they'll start to learn."
"Get your sound sorted, Un subscribed"
Who are you ?
31:32 wrong!!!! 😂
They didn’t get the co-op right we didn’t want an MMO legit no one asked for it we wanted borderlands type co-op I don’t know a soul who liked that also if the game was perfectly fine 0 bugged it’s still horrible.
I’m imagining Todd Howard as a QB for the Cowboys 🤣 probably better than Dak!
31:31 WROOOOONG
I like how Joe takes every sw feature like just some element that just exists in the world and you can reuse it just by knowing that you used them successfully in some other application before.
lol
Fallout 76 killed the gamer in my soul.
RIP
53:07
16x the detail my ass.
At this point these companies think that patches count as DLC.
Really interesting to watch this before Fallout 1st. Lol
This is why I like alternatives instead of getting a shitty video game. We watch reviews from people that actually give a shit about the product whether they are praising it or basically saying that it is shit(more so if it is true).
"I hate how there's apparently ""mutations"" that allows you to jump high, and fall slower, so players raiding your workshop are able to Bunnyhop all over the place, shooting you with high explosive weapons, unable to defend yourself. Like I know that it's a feature supposedly, but it seems cheap to have a few level 13s bullied by a triple 300+ player with both mutations, unable to fight back against it, bc apparently, they can also one shot turrets which is fun"
I got this game for £8 and still feel like I got ripped off.
Sad how the industry works after so long it's just gonna be about money tod ain't playing wizardry anymore he cashed out and older scrolls 6 will be terrible as well and dude will retire you need a age check on him see this stuff its psychology  how old is homeboy getting lol the whole industry  is corrupt it's been about money from day one world beater games died after ps2 and halfway through ps3 lifecycles and xbox was just American corporate trying to take a slice of market whatver been calling this industry for 15 years ain't been wrong yet those kids  spent to much money on call of duty black ops when it out performed all other media that year that's what started this lazy dev consolized trash corporate commander free for all and the market will crash again now that tech moving towards quantum vr failed to take off indie has no money and triple a has no talent so that's when  the suits came uh knocking its youtube that spawned that hype as well. Tod made all his money on 13 year olds.
Sad how you apparently hate punctuation.
20:30 I can't get over Joe's expression🤣
Where did del go lmao
No quest just robots and holotapes joe is 100% so boring 0/10 want my dam money back 💩
I was so appalled by this it’s started and argument with anyone who like it what have they done?🥲🥲 bye fallout and atom shop what a double slap in the face
Todd has been a liar since fallout 4.
their not bugs their FeAtUreS
So what happened to Delrith anyway?
"He does his own thing mostly, but I think I've heard his voice in some of the streams, like he still plays with Joe. I also heard there was some drama or something with that guy."
Hey 3 years later and still $40.
This game wasn't that bad honestly like Joe needs to review this game in it's current condition.
Why does he need to do that?
It came out 3 year's ago for 60 bucks
OJ was right still not free to play I doubt they’ll ever do it
"Romance girl ,."
"Wow,."
"Perfect reason number 2 that I quit watching this moron,  listening to these 3 snowflakes crying about not being able to grief other players.... smh"
"You are aware that PvP was a HUGE advertisement. 
Griefing was fking intended because that's what this kind of PvP includes.

And they don't whine. They complain that the instigator of PvP is ALWAYS in disadvantage.
And now think for a moment. If you don't want to watch him, fine. But no need to be that hostile."
" @Kairos_Akuma  awe did you stop by just to tell me how to live my life.... how precious of you. Stay your lane bro, you do you, let others do what they do. I can be how ever I wanna bye"
" @rayvencraft  Damn straight! If you want to tell petty lies about people online, well, you have that right!"
" @BWMagus  its not lies, its called my opinion. Do you not understand that most people don't agree with you? These jokers opinion  suck. Sucks that, that statement hurts your buttgole."
@Raymond Price  lol why are you soo weird?
"IS A 2, A FUCKING 2; 2 OUTTA 10.  Lmao"
Well it's still not F2P so I guess Other Joe's right.
25:12 lmao
WRONG! 😂😂😤😤
"ironic people still defend this game to this day, i think its in a ok condition now and days with the npcs but only if you dont know what to play and your board and want something to pass the time i like some of the elements like the enviroments and creatures but fuck fallout 1st a fucking sub to fix ur fucking storage problem"
Times fly by and this game is still a piece of SH*** cash grab
Duke nukem forever is way better then this piece of S**t. Why you didn't throw the fallout 76 kase in to toilet?
"Fallout76 is way better now, WAY better, but the start was just horrendous"
They should have made it like ark or rust
buying games becomes stupid
always gotta come back and watch this every once in a while lmao
"Have you thought about doing an updated version of this now that the game is vastly different? I'd love to see something like that!. Thanks for the videos, keep up the good work
-A Fellow Joe"
awww... there was a class action lawsuit??? now I gotta look up what happened with that. (I was under a rock... in a cave... on mars... with my finger in my ears and my eyes squeezed shut)
Classic example of put it out now fix it later syndrome
"I can totally see them all in the office trying to fix something 

dev 1: someone get the copy of Morrowind on floppy!!!

dev 2: ILL GET IT!

dev 3: you can trust the floppy copy to a noob!"
Still $55 on Steam in 2021.
"Give Fallout 76 a chance since it cost like 5 usd where i am and boys it suck. Bathesa engine had been outdated and that had been for long long time now fallout 3 was it peak and yes they squeeze out a bit more on 4 but that it. The charm of fallout was it story lore that why people explore the world doing all of the thing they do in it. People love Fallout but got hit by a massive rose color glasses, Fallout 3-4 had been buggy broken (1-2 is also broken) and look bad compare to all the game of the similar era and bathesa had never fix any of it, it the community that fix the game release all this mod for player to play cause they love the lore and story. Fallout had always been buy the game and here the list of Mod required to play. and people just forgot that you need to fix just to play and just remember the good part (rose color glasses). and Fallout 76 is when they fucked up, releasing the game with their broke as outdated engine with outdated visual crank up the anti-aliasing make it MMO so no Mod to fix stuff, then remove all of it story and NPC so what is left is a broken game"
"Three years later and Other Joe was right, it did not go free to play."
"What happened to Del? He was a good guy. You're making millions, why didn't you put him on payroll?"
He pulled a Denice Crosby.
 @HempKnight2112  what do this mean
" @knuteknoll6747  in star trek The next generation, Denise Crosby quit the show to become a bigger better actress, but failed."
 @HempKnight2112  i see. I assume it wasnt an amicable seperation then lol (for AJS and del)
" @knuteknoll6747  indeed, no bad blood."
Is that Michael De Santos son there?!
I'm a game sometimes I don't want to play with other people there are certain titles I feel like I shouldn't have to in Fallout was one of them GTA with another one until they made 5 I enjoyed Fallout until they made 76 I enjoyed GTA until they made five install all of the story mode DLC to put on the online version for free so that they can make microtransaction money which is something I noticed you don't talk a whole lot about you hate microtransactions with EA does it but when Rockstar does it I guess there's crickets and I'm not talking about the phone alls I'm saying is this there are markets for multiplayer games and there are markets for story-based game in my opinion GTA V Fallout 76 should have stayed the course if you wanted to do online for both games do the story first make sure the story is good and then do whatever you want the reason why Fallout 76 was such a disaster is because it's that you making a great story you just wanted to make as much money as you could which makes Bethesda disgusting as far as GTA V goes rock stars just a piece of s*** they they saw an opportunity to capitalize on the Grandeur of GTA V story mode so they fired the writer who wrote the DLC for the story mode while he was on vacation a scumbag move if you ask me but I wonder what are your thoughts on the subject of both games a gaming in a ho because I hate microtransactions as much as you do actually I hate them more I believe they totally destroyed the story-based game moving forward
"24:36 
OJ: me
Del: my annoying cousin"
"Ok, 2 years later... I'm watching this and decide to give the game another try, even though I've given up on it multiple times. During the time of this video, I experienced 3 full on crashes from the main menu and had the ""stuck at the workbench when you finish so you have to fast travel to break out of it"" happen twice. Wow..."
"Amazing, fucking amazing."
at least you got 16 times the detail xD
"Near as I can tell, it’s still pretty buggy, and while it respects your time slightly more than it did at launch, it respects your wallet a whole hell of a lot less."
I gave up on 76 a few months ago it's just as screwed as before especially with all of the issues they created for no reason and then they sell us a fix..
"Watched the Fallout 4 review first saying, hey next time new engine. 😂"
Once upon a time I agreed with you but it’s actually really good nos
"This is what a buggy launch can do, can keep a fallout fanboy from touching an iteration due to how many people hated the game. Here I am, 4th if july in 2021, finally considering seeing what fallout 76 is like. CDPR should've taken note from blunders like fallout 76."
It's 2021: Still. No. Elder. Scrolls. 6. Gameplay!
I feel like Del liked this game way more than he let on. How do you get to level 180 or whatever reviewer or otherwise?
Almost heaven west virginia blue ridge mountain shenandoah river. 16 TIMES THE DETAIL 🌋
2.5 years later and I'm still very much enjoying Fallout 76.
"33:30 “What would you call it”
A failure
A mistake
A cash Grab 
Intolerable 
Inexcusable"
"For the record, it’s mid-2021 now and you can still get stuck in your power armor.

I force closed the game after waiting for ages, and it straight up deleted my power armor. (Full Ultracite set with jetpack)

At which point I just stopped playing. 😅"
"I’ll just give you what ever set you want dude, if you are on Playstation.   Ultracite is the easiest set to acquire as well."
"The real question is, why are you wasting your life playing this ""game""???"
I miss Delrith
Never bought the game glad I didn't money saved👌
Watching this post Microsofts aquisition is so weird. XD
"Joe they added tons of npcs with interesting quests and stories, you need to do an updated review, I just bought it and I love it now!"
Too late dumbass
Bulldozer...oh good god what were they thinking!
Got this in 2021 for 10 pounds .worth  the money  now lol
"Only hardcore fans will come back to play the games after they’re “fixed,” you as a game company have to get it right the first time or you will leave most fans jaded and annoyed, no need to rush development but get it right at release"
Fanboys now still defend this game....Ridiculous. 16x the fanboys.
This didnt age well it didnt go free to play and its a really good game now
"Who cares. Games supposed to be great at launch, not 3 years later."
wow
"In 2021, the game is much different."
"""Ooh, that person threw trash in the trashcan, let's applaud. Give them a trophy and a pat in the back too. What, he threw a car in the lake last week? Don't worry, he is different now."" That is what it feels like."
 @hirobeez  ok :/
"I think they did a better job with ESO to be honest. One thing that pisses both me and my girlfriend off in relation to Bethesda/Zenimax online games is the bloody inventory space. ESPECIALLY Elder Scrolls Online! ""Yeah you just killed this boss... INVENTORY FULL!"" So you either have to just leave or drop some shit that you may need. Luckily I have that merchant assistant I can just call on but still if it's armour, etc. then it's not an option as I want to deconstruct it."
"I shit my pants when I heard 76 was a new Bethesda game, then I shit my pants after playing it. But for different reasons."
"76 looks slightly better than 4??  The fact the he didn't even get a wtf? Look, i take this channel serious as a gaming channel."
If Bethesda monetizes the perk card system  in the next Fallout I'm gonna f**king lose it
I watch this every time I think about playing fallout 76 😂😆😂😆
"Me too, but with Internet historians video"
"""You got Morrowind on floppy?""
I fuckin spit out my coffee ALL over my desk. Love Joe"
OJ was right
I think people have the memories of goldfish when they forgive everything that this game did
"The people praising it now are the people giving the exact reaction Bethesda wants. They’re ignoring the game’s past to say “it’s fine now”, which in turn excuses Bethesda’s actions. Waiting 2-3 years to get the game in fine condition is just gross. It should’ve launched that way. It’s like nobody has the balls to make a stand and are just fine with indulging Bethesda in what they did."
" @KizaruB  It's the problem of this civilization, really. Most stuff only works because people learnt the concept of authority: Do, think and feel what other people tell you, and you're a good person. This then leads to businesses easier getting away with fraud. I'm glad the independent internet / freedom of opinion still exists."
"I've never played this game and likely never will because products like these at launch and overall don't deserve my money and this comes from someone who has been Fallout fan for long time. I think players are stupid and part to blame that they  tolerate this kind of business practices and philosophy that it's okay to have piece of shit, broken ass, fucked up cash grab, lore breaking, unethical microtransaction shitfests as long as the company fixes it later.. well if they do. If you give them to your money you are part to blame."
Game is good to go now!
It’s fine. Fallout 1st and Atomic Shop tho are still crap.
They should’ve made it good at release
This game should have been just a single player Fallout with Co-op. That's all I wanted.
Here everyone! We added content that should have been there to begin with... it crashes the game but fuck you there you go.
"This is basically live service, and it sucks. Sell absolute garbage that risks destroying a franchise, then add content and people with the memories of goldfish forgive you for it."
Its free use the glitch to get and keep all game pass games
"In retrospect.. AngryJoe was actually pretty spot on about where the game went from launch. 2 and a half years later Bethesda is attempting to monetize perk loadout and perk points. Wastelanders did come with human NPC's. Would like to mention only one other vault has actually opened in Adventure mode and that is Vault 94. The vault was empty but came with a Vault raid for four people. They took it offline shortly after and now sits as a location for the new ""Daily Ops,"" which was good for the game, but is extremely boring. Survival Mode did come and did decent but was replaced months later with a Battle Royale that is the most redeeming thing about the game to date. Fallout 1st is of course, absolutely ridiculous. At least you get the best value in atoms for the Atomic Shop. Private servers are nothing that was promised. Only 8 players per server while public servers hold 24 players with no mod support. The game is still not Free To Play and never will go Free To Play. It is still $40 on Steam. They have attempted to draw people in with ""Seasonal Rewards"" but they are pretty basic in nature. (stimpaks, radaways, lunchboxes, perk card packs, some skins and CAMP items)"
Sounds like Garbage GTA Online. Such a Sad Pathetic Grind
"2006 - November 2018 ""In Todd we trust."""
...what has happened to Del?
He's doing his own thing
"That's why lauding No Man Sky is dangerous. Publishers see these success stories and think ""ya it will be fine to release a game half done"""
Its still trash and will never play or buy it.
"Yes. Fallout 76 is definitely better than how it launched, but it’s still and will always be mediocre due to its poor foundation, built upon lies and greed."
"I think the 2 out of ten is deserved when you take into account all the lies. Some people couldn't get access to an easy refund - they were screwed.

Lies so ludicrous as these should be an automat -5 points to the rating."
"this is like my 6th time watching this, im still laughing way too hard, good job Joe and team!"
How broken does have to be to get a 1/10?
There is no way this could work in elder scrolls. Make Skyrim with newer graphics a new story and innovate some things I love the star system for levels and perks.
"Here in 2021. Gotta say, the game made a huge comeback. I'm absolutely loving it now.  Took them forever, but im glad they at least stuck with it"
Yeah me too. I've enjoyed FO76 since wastelanders dropped.
Still it should’ve been good on release instead they lied about everything in the game
"This did not age well, as they improved the game since released"
Improving the game doesn’t erase what Bethesda has done in the name of this game. The PR damage is still done.
Where's Del?
Doing his own thing
1:33
"why this game got 3/10 and cyberpunk got a fucking 6.. its basically same shit and if you really look at it in depth, cyberpunk is fundamentally broken. even more than this."
"The story somewhat adds up. The gameplay is not finished and polished , but it's there, everything else break down really fast. But i agree, 6 is still a generous score, should have been 5 or 4 at max but i think Joe has a soft spot for CDPR"
 @jakenguyen1150  cyberpunk is trash the bugs actually hide the real flaws of the game smart
"Probably because if you removed all the awful game-breaking glitches and performance issues, the game was quite decent. Fallout 76 on the other hand had almost nothing redeemable about it."
"this is out of date, game improvements made to 76 have fixed most of these issues."
And? They fix that?
"It’s better, but still only like 6/10 material imo. It’s definitely not peak Fallout."
This review is 2 years old when the game was released and shit sooooo clearly it’s not up to date
Remaster New Vegas? Is that a good idea?
Looks like someones is making a new “new Vegas”
"Its called fallout new Vegas frontier, I know nothing about it."
CyberAnthem 2076
I miss dell so luch hope hes doin good
Funny thing is that now it’s on game pass lol
"I’m sorry, fallout 3 was and still is the best fallout game ever. Yes new Vegas and four may have pushed some innovative boundaries but fallout 3 felt like a fallout game in the best way possible."
Yeah 3 a carbon copy of fall out 1 and 2
19998?
So many points in this are so relevant to Cyberpunk as well.
"In my opinion, I wish more people would have went like:
Oh cool a new fallout game! Online only? Hahahahaha. No. 
That was my reaction and I'm glad I stayed with my gut."
"If you don't protect the bench properly like a base, of course your base sucks and it gets captured, like yeah turrets deactivate but if you choose to build like an idiot or easy path to that bench yeah your gonna get captured pretty obvious"
"Looks like Other Joe won that bet. They still haven't gone free to play. Without special sales prices, it still has a regular retail value of $40, according to the Playstation Store."
2/10 is still too generous
I think it's called Fallout 78 because it's better than 77
Big steaming shit of a game. Almost as bad as Cyberpunk.
it was that bad 2 years ago
" @mariusv.3097  it’s still got quite a lot of issues. Fallout 1st, Atomic Shop, the fact the community literally forgave Bethesda after all the lying and betrayal. It also still has that signature Bethesda buginess that doesn’t go away no matter how much you patch games."
Fallout 76 turned out to be an awesome game.
"As of rn, this game is ftp with GamePass xD"
I honestly think it shoulda been a 2
I’ve played this game a lot (Level 195). I took a year off of the game after I played it when it dropped. It’s pretty good now. You should check it out.
I went from level 11 to 53 since wastelanders was introduced. It's good not great now and I have fun with it.
Looks like there's Spiderman behind Joe.
51:06 I love how the camera switched away from Joe as if the spanking or beating he was giving Bethesda was just so brutal it couldn't be shown.
I know.  I know . But what's Dels channel. Thanks
ctrl+Alt+Delrith
57:00  18$ FOR BLUE!!!!
After 2 years... the game is free
"""I think Blades is gonna be one of the best mobile games."" Well THAT sure didn't age well Joe!"
The only cool things about the game are new weapon types and some of the armor sets and power armor are cool. The rest is still a dumpster fire.
"Joe: 'Lets talk about how they could have done PvP right'
Tom Howard: ""Battle Royale?"""
Now it's encouraged to play it like a single player game instead of multiplayer due to recent updates. lol
"still cant get it out my head in 2020...""Tell me lies tell me sweat little lies"""
"21:50

The way Joe addresses Del here is the only I revisit this video"
"YT sending me here during the Rona, good times to only biatch aboot suits like Thodd."
Also it’s Not free to play.
"[56:35] ""They had planned to do 6 DLCs, and they're all free""

Oh how wrong you were. But then again you said it yourself, you were a blind fanboy of bethesda. FO76 was probably the start of the tipping point, you were still clinging onto your last desperate hope."
Skyrim was/is broken but at least it was fun and a ton of stuff in it to
"It’s so weird because I remember initially being excited when it started getting announced, but so soon after fo4 with no es6...what’s wrong with it? It’s an mmo! Oohhhhh, pass. I’ve played mmos too. Wow the longest but an mmo fo? Just no."
The could have just remade New Vegas and that would sell more than F76.
"I remember buying Skyrim for ps3. I had no internet at the time, so updating/bugfixes were not available for me.

Guess how that went...

After lvl 25 in that build the entire screen was just blue, completely unplayable.
I restarted the ps3, played for 15 minutes and the screen went entirely blue again.

I returned the disc to GameStop, thought it was something wrong with it.

But no it was Bethesda being incompetent.

Honestly, I dont think they are able to create a bug-free game. Prove me wrong.

If they tried create the simplest game in the world, like snake for phones, it would still crash or bug out every 15 minutes."
In 2020 this game is still garbage with nothing to do
OJ was right it aint going free
Because Bethesda still wants to stuff their face in their own ass.
Millions of players have played the game. And also Millions of players have uninstalled it immediately.
All I wanted was new Vegas but with multiplayer to play with my friends

11:33 the rose colored glasses was there when skyrim came out
five finger death punch
Microsoft owns them.... lets see what happens...
"It all comes down to who's harder. When push comes to shove in decision making, whoever holds the final say will determine whether this franchise is redeemable."
October 2020 Fallout 76 is on gamepass... kinda f2p
Its 2020 and I still love watching Fallout 76 videos on youtube
To think this was Microsoft's secret weapon...
"these people are such pieces of shit. Bethesda, rockstar, turn10, EA ect they're now making literal SHIT. at a premium price. are they working the employees this hard? or what!??"
This game has got so much better. I would love a different review for this
You can now expect this quality on Xbox 😆
"Joe was right about the NPCs thing haha. 
I don't miss Dell so much 😉"
"Dell was being prudent, can't fault him for that looking at the state of the gaming industry now."
Besides all the SHIT FO76 has... its still a quality game with nice animations and lots of things to keep you busy and happy. Maybe you should play it also overfeed bethesda and maybe they fix it and give us PvP never ending content.
1 star cloaking wood leg drop from a 3 star SBQ is still a thing in fo76.
"Who finds broken one sided pvp with no reward fun?

Dark Souls players"
[over priced amount] dollars for blue! That’s the bench mark for micro transactions. How much are they charging for blue?
You look a little stoned here joe
"47:22 well they certainly did something within a year.....
but it was quite the opposite of going free-to-play"
The game still sucks balls
"Had to update yesterday xbox one, played after it updated, got disconnected twice in my private server with fallout 1st whenever I joined my friends team, my buddy in America had a glitch with fallout saying he needs to buy 1st even though it runs out today, it said that Yesterday What The Fuck?..

I ran into a glitch myself where my ap drained from being overencombered, so I scrapped all my junk, used some hunger/thirst items, still drained even though it said ""192/195"" carry weight..

I also ran into the glitch Del mentioned the ""Damage bug"" 2020 August 24th yesterday.. I got the same exact glitch 3 times exp farming..

Overall the game is Slightly better, But hey I'm British how would I know about the fallout series when I like this game, I tried fallout 4 didn't get into it same with 3 because I prefer elder scrolls, but I like this only because I can build, also vats needs patching, I aim and it changes target when I didn't choose that target because It's further away.."
He pulled a Peter molyneux
I believe they didn’t add Human NPCs because they were trying to be realistic. If bombs actually fell all human life would be dead and the only thing left remaining would be technology in a damaged state besides for those that would have survived the bombs by being inside the Vaults.
Always watch Todd Howard's on stage behavior. When they announce Skyrim. You can see Todd is being humble and nervous. While here in announcing Fallout 76. He change a lot. He became so confident and joking around and Emphasizing how good the game will be. We should be worried if they announce future games with Todd acting like Fallout 76
I got it free xbox game pass lol
not worth the memory
"My fav is NV, then 3 then 4. But I actually like 4 more than a lot of people. Not the main quest but I love the dlc far harbor and nuka world. It just didn’t have deep RPG feel, felt more dumbed down first person shooter in general. But I’d kill for a obsidian fallout at this point"
"Movies cost a shit ton to make but you don't pay $60 for a cinema ticket, I don't see why these games should be sold for that much and THEN monetised more with micro transactions. Like if they did that with movies, the cinemas would shut pretty fast. I'm tired of what is happening to computer games and tbh I won't be getting any of the new gen consoles or even buying new games anymore. Feels like a waste of money if you have to pay $60 for an incomplete game and then pay at least another $40 to play the game how you want. It is fucking pathetic and money once again has ruined the industry."
"It’s not free...this is no theory, nor a game theory."
55:30 I'm from the future.  Joe is a prophet.
"Legend has it that the background isnt a real green screen, and that Joe actually has a secret AJ underground lair"
Evolve had shitty microtransactions but at least it was more fun most of the time.
I can only really see The Elder Scroll 6 being like the old Bethesda games with some modern improvements. Fallout could’ve evolved but you did it wrong - TES needs to be kept in a certain state.
"I find it funny that developers that brag show up with a shitty game, and the smaller developers that go “ok guys we’ve got these little features working, and we’re hoping to try to import this” then show up with what’s considered a AAA title"
"Since the Wastelanders dlc has been released and has had time to actually fix Fallout 76 to a more stable and playable state, I can safely say that Fallout 76 has gone from being the worst game in the franchise to mostly positive. Making Fallout 76 the most polarizing of the franchise. I still enjoyed it since but I’m sure they’re still nay sayers out lambasting the game."
Who gives a shit how the game is NOW 😂😂😂
 @JohnDoe-dj3lw  cause it's an MMO? and MMOs are constantly expanding and updating. Elder scrolls online launched the exact same way look at it now
 @Richtofen  I consider Fallout 76 a cross between Bohemia Interactive’s seminal survival game DayZ and Elder Scrolls Online in some cases
But at least you have a glow in the dark map and a plastic helmet
"2/10

And now, with the updates?
2/10

Fuck you Butthesda

I don't even have hope for Elder Scrolls games now"
Free to play? Nah suckas $99 a year subscription fee.
"Dude, I bought the game in a pre-order and God, worst thing I could have done, now I don't pre-order any more. So thanks bethesda"
I mean I’m enjoying fallout 76 a little more now because of wastelanders and a few things they have changed is good
"To be fair I like the mechanic where you can't just go around murdering everyone,if that did happen the game just wouldn't be enjoyable, when I'm a low level I wanna enjoy the game and rise up uninterrupted by some sweaty nerd who wants to flex his in game pecks. Granted I've only played the game once at a friends house and didn't take it seriously, making my character a walking burn/mauling victim for fun, but it wasn't entirely bad to me"
I don’t know shit about this game but from what I hear I don’t get how it gets a 2 or 3 out of 10... seriously sounds like a 0 🤔
the hit bethesda took from this made them delay Elder Scrolls 6 to 2026 in hope of the world forgetting about this 🤦🏼‍♂️
It’s July 2020 and Fallout 76 is now available on Xbox game pass. Is it worth downloading and playing through it now??
Try it you don't have nothing to lose
Storage amount because the server can't handle it but charge you for inf storage.
"It's basically Fallout sandbox mode. I like fallout, so I'm glad I finally disregarded all the negative reviews that have deterred me from trying. Heck, I just now bought Fallout 4, too, and that game is so much better than reviews made it seem. Having a blast going between FO 76 & FO4."
Guys todd did not lie because he didn't say the game would be good
"A nice example of why I always wait for reviews from known non-shills before buying anything. Except Dragon Age II. I foolishly trusted Bioware and they got me with that one. But to get revenge on them for scamming me I haven't bought anything they have made since, and never will. So this is definitely a very short-term strategy for game devs. The next time it won't work. The time after that you'll be unemployed and the company will be gone."
"One year and a half later, and I’m still waiting for it to go free-to-play"
"it's fun on gta v, but they need to spawn like 100 feet away in another town"
"""hey guys were gonna do something new but we have done it before"""
It is on Steam now so i can buy the game just to refund safely.
I still dont know how so many people fell for this obvious scam of a game
Skyrim got a 10/10. How far we have fallen..
Also the raiders had raider legends that you could listen to if you were undetected
"To this day I still don’t get how people just call joe a “troll” for honestly showing how garbage this game was and honestly still mostly is, there’s only so many ways you can defend a polished pile of shit"
human npcs are in the game lol
"Yeah, they're down to 30k-40k players at any given time, that's so fucking sad it's not even funny."
Maybe they should take a lesson from Dark Souls 3 are you going to invade people
Loved Skyrim but it had its moments too. No where near as bad as Fallout 76. Every clip I see on 76 makes Destiny look like such a cleaner better made game
A low bar. Destiny wasn't broken on a technical level like FO76. It was just a boring version of Borderlands IMHO
Hey I never view score for Fallout 76 for Xbox one has changed to a 38 star rating
"I agree with nearly all the stuff you're saying, but I loved when you said ""I have a theory"" with a finger in the air. That's like a parody of basically every armchair CEO and businessman, even if you weren't doing it ironically or anything."
"Why is there a cryolator in Appalachia? In Fallout 4, it was an experimental weapon belonging exclusively to a member of the vault. Having it exist elsewhere with the same design is just lazy on Bethesda’s part. It’s like the jet retcon, it’s not a huge deal, but it shows how lazy Bethesda really is about adhering to Fallout lore."
Lol you can make blue in Fall out 4 free
Fall out never be online
Bethesda Was Never That Good It Was Just That They Were So Good At Storytelling That It Blinded Us From Their Bugs And It Is Just Said
"Holy shit, AJ is the best soothsayer ever!!!"
"Bethesda sold people the ""Frame of a car"" for the full cost of a car, and then just planned to slowly patch their way to a full car. Releasing this game like this was CRIMINAL in my opinion."
I told people that this game wasn’t meant to be but noooooo I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about
Thier is mod that fan made for fallout 4 but besthda used that mod for fallout 76 in its core game  and said they themselves made it. The original creator of the mod spoke out about about it and was attack by fallout and besthda fanboys. He made one final mod for fallout 4 called a Asad farewell. To this day at least to my knowledge he hasn't created any new mods. Its sad to know that fans work was stolen from a company that he probably liked and dint get credit for it and was attack for speaking out about it.
"We human beings are retards in general, especially in groups."
Joequel the joequel
Free to Play equals $100 subscription?
Its an angry rant till the middle then it becomes an intervention for todd and bethesda
"Only a few people will get back to this game

Laughs in Fallout groups already celebrating and praising Bethesda for adding NPCs"
"That is why i think you should include in your reviews version number you are playing, so maybe later you or your team in a rapidFire can make an update on the new version of the game, like Crash Team Racing, at start it had no microtransactions, later they add it, and you can review that version"
"Nobody replied to Del ""How you doing?"" at the start."
"I swear seeing joe and Todd Howard in a picture together is legendary. While I know some people hate Todd at the moment for how the way fallout 76  turned out, I can not get over the fact for all of the great things he’s done for gamers around the world."
"Regarding Fallout 4's graphics, I think Far Harbor looks really good."
"I like the game on PC Steam. But it runs like garbage. Every time I try to do something the game freaks out and I fight with the controls, the camera view. It sucks. You can easily have a good time if the mother fucker works. Dead Island zombies, those are a masterpiece zombies with tons of variations. Here you can count the zombies."
"I have been playing 76 since launch on and off on Xbox and have about 300ish hours. I got the delux pre order that came with the helmet and I felt really betrayed by Bethesda. Fallout 4 is one of my favorite games of all time and so I was super exited when 76 was announced. The world just didn't feel like a fallout game before wastelanders. I've now had about 20 hours playing wastelanders also on Xbox, and I have completed the main plot and some of the ally quests. Once wastelanders came out it felt like a whole new product. Lots of the locations were the same but it just felt so much more filled out and lifelike. The alloys (companions) are a bit of a disappointment, most of their quests are just, go here get this, or go there kill that. Also, some really well written and well voice acted moments are ruined by the bad animations as the gravity of things is lost when the npc's are limited to so few movement patterns. My final critique would be that you cant explore more than one option in a situation. I get that Bethesda wants to make players have to choose and stick with their choice but still, one of my favorite aspects of previous fallout games was the ability to quicksave before an important conversation and see what options I could explore. Too many times in wastelanders I wanted to say one this to see what would happen but didn't as I was worried it would damage my faction reputation of rewards later on. As an extension of this I would like the ability to try and kill every npc at crater or foundation. I thought that it was great in previous fallout games that you could just raid a whole town like diamond city just to see if you could. Yet, in wastelanders I cant do that because that might end my ability to associate with that faction. The grind to gain that status is so long that I don't want to risk losing that. Plus there's no real reward for just going on a murder spree (admittingly there isn't in previous fallout games either) so the game just kinda forces you to play by Bethesda rules when previous fallout games felt so good because you could make your own rules in your own world and cater the experience for what you desire. Wastelanders was a step in the right direction for fallout 76 and I am very excited to see what Bethesda bring out next (hopefully a price reduction on fallout 1st along with more new content). By no means is this game now perfect, there are still bugs and it is very much still fallout 76, but it is more on par with just a bad dlc then a burning fire of ""microtransactions, the game"". My pre wastelanders rating of the game would be a 3/10 and post watelanders 7.5/10. Both of those are not compared to all other rpgs but as far as fallout games go 76 may yet grow into one of the best!"
The glitch that was patched about being overcumbered and respawning at vault 76 happened to me today
"Back after the Wastelanders DLC and I still don’t understand why anyone would consider playing this game. It runs like shit, looks like shit, and boring as shit (and I’m NOT exaggerating). It took long as FUCK to download, the battle royale is shit, the FPS IS STILL SHIT. Like I don’t understand. This is a new era for video games and this is something that should’ve never released PERIOD. YOU FUCKED IT UP (again...)"
Would u consider doing an updated review on this game tho Angry Joe?
I keep on getting Ads for the game before AJS Episodes
Don’t throw the engine out joe?! It’s like 20 years old ffs
Funny cause he said in his fallout 4 review that the engine was crap and he said Bethesda should use a new engine next time. How right he was they did need to use a new engine.
"none of you can even explain what the engine is or how it works, let alone how it is the problem versus the fault of the development team utilizing it"
"Bethesda: “Hey id! Can I borrow a pencil?”

id: “Sure bro! Here ya go!”

Bethesda: “ We’re getting a lot of help from places like id Software for the development of Fallout: 76! “

id: “YO! WHAT DA FUCK MAN!?”"
Makes me worried about the future of all Zenimax games.  I'll have a gaming PC by the time Starfield comes but geez MS fanboys acting like they're perfect since the buyout is hilarious to see after seeing people complain for a decade before that buyout
"Just me imagining Doom Slayer take off his helmet, crush a cacodemon he was holding, and shout ""WHAT!?"""
why not have id software work on a fallout game or obsiden again them and bethesda is both owned by xbox now
and tomorrow...we should see human npcs lets see what happens.
"HOLY FUCK, just got a Mary Jane brain explosion...Fallout 5: post apocalyptic pirate game!!!  Only let Obsidian do it tho..."
"I am from the Future, Fallout76 is still garbage."
Watch AJ straight up cry on his review if ES6 sucks
"Oh man if Bethesda fuck up ES6 I swear to god they will die as a company The Elder Scrolls is their last chance to redeem themselves if however they mess up elder scrolls 6 i.e. rushing development, putting microtransactions into the game (a full price 60 dollar triple a game should not have microtransactions in it.) and treating their fans like garbage basically if they repeat what they did with fallout 76 in the next elder scrolls forget about it they're done as a company."
Fallout 4 and 76 Singlehandedly Killed The Lore.
I don't understand why people pre order games. Just wait a couple days after it comes out and other people like Joe will let you know whether or not it's a complete piece of shit.
Buy fallout 4 and install mods that make make fallout like fallout 76 but better
and the game is coming to steam....
2020….yeah fuck this IP
"“Hey guys we are going to try something new, well we’ve done it before”"
"I'm gonna start off by saying I didn't buy Fallout 76, When I was seeing previews for it I honest to god thought the game would be interesting but also had a gut feeling it would be a flop. It was one of those games where its was either gonna be a big freaking hit, like game of the year or it would be a major flop and I really wanted it to be a big hit. I always dreamed of fallout with a friend or 3. I will be honest I actually really sad the game was a flop, I'm happy I saved $60 dollars but I really wanted my co-op fallout. And I feel the same way about Halo 5, These game companies need to start doing right by us and for the games. I love these game franchises and I love to keep buying and playing them it it makes me sad that I can't do that because of how these game companies are treating us the consumers and killing the games I love."
"Halo was a disappointment for sure, but at the very least it worked. What FO76 was, should serve as a lesson in what not to do. The game was broken. Like BROKEN broken. More than a standard issue Bethesda game. I lost count on how many times Skyrim froze on me for 360, but still finished  it. FO76.......good lord man"
I'll rather have a real fallout the playing this shit
TLDR 31:31
"If they make a Fallout 5.  Aside from fixing the bugs and keep the microtransactions to a minimum, I'd like to see the environment, characters, and overall story be impacted from the decisions you make in the game."
I believe u and now they’re putting wastelanders in.. and a fuckin BOW BRO of all things basically a shitty crossbow
⁰
"Bethesda owes an apology with elder scrolls online problems and the complete disaster of fallout. Thankfully elder scrolls online is way better now, but there’s no fixing the issues fallout 76. Can’t wait for elder scrolls VI!"
No give them a $100 plus 60 more.
Every customer who bought Fallout First for 100$ gets a copy of Ride to Hell: Retribution for free.
Fuck no🤣🙁
"To quote the press release for fallout 1st ""you deserve it"""
Joe was right with his human npc theory
"this is a terrible way to go about games :( a game shouldn't be ""fix later through updates"" a game should be full of content from release then maybe add stuff as EXTRAS :/ other games are gonna follow this lazy trend if you just forgive them after a few updates :/"
"Not in a bad way but on joe’s own scale a 1/10 is for games that don’t function. This game does not work in any aspect and Bethesda imo has never been worthy of the loyalty they’ve been given. They’ve only come under fire now (imo) because game technology has come so far that people are finally seeing what Bethesda really is, a joke. 1/10"
“Iam the wendigo man “
"This ""game"" Fallout of my PC after 76 hours"
Contry roads take me home please
Just wait for it Joe mores coming ;)
I don’t even like the Fallout franchise and somehow I feel disappointed and ripped off by Bethesda. My heart goes out to the fans who were invested in this series.
I just used to change my time and date on the ipad and then i got like 50 lunchboxes in an hour in  fallout shelter for free
The holo types killed it for me at the beginning before the bugs!
its 2020 and i keep watching 76 reviews
little did we know fallout 76 is still a topic in 2020
Saw this in my local used games shop the other day for £7.99. Still way too much for this shit.
47:13  Oh boy 🤣 do i need to explain?
"Talk about the Endgame Del.... 

I can do one better...... 


It takes place 5 years later after thanos snapped his fingers lol"
Overwatch... the best Hero shooter! ....ME: ...only thing good about itis the Pornhub assets...
It should've been a 2/10.
"OJ was right, not only NOT free to play, but - Monthly"
"Alex ain't here cuz he won't stand for this game at all. That's my theory. Maybe it's explained elsewise for other raisins and I just haven't seen them yet, but if I had to guess: he's excused himself from touching this piece of trash game, and I don't blame him one bittle. ...but I do blame him for calling HL:Alyx a ""game you have to buy a stupid helmet to play"". VR IS TEH FUTURE, GET W/ IT ALEX!!!"
Watch reviews before u buy any game nowadays.
Its at 10 bucks on ebay 💀
9:23 Yeah... I think 2/10 is now more desired for what's happening to the game currently. Probably even less.
"December 31,2019 going into 2020 and it's 20dollers 😭"
"Damn, It's been a long time and it's still shit lol. So glad I never played and fallout games."
Year later and still not free-to-play... yet 🙃
Oh an extended rant 🤣 This game must have pissed off JoJo Royally
Still not free to play.....
2 of 10? Thats too high!
"Robert A. Altman is the current owner and CEO of Zenimax, the parent company and owner of Bethesda game Studios. He's a law graduate whose represented royal members of House Saudi in the 1970-80s. During his time with them he was accused by the United States of a scheme to defraud the state Banking Department in order to obtain a license to operate a bank. Prosecutors had charged that the deceit allowed the Bank of Credit & Commerce International, whose customers included drug dealers, Middle East terrorists, corrupt politicians and dictators, to secretly gain ownership of a major U.S. bank, First American Bankshares Inc. of Washington. Shortly after he was acquitted he co-founded Zenimax with his best friend in the 90s, only to push him out and take full control of the company.  He's the real villain you're looking for."
underground868 404 error: relevance not found
The Looinrims I think he was trying to show why decisions that lead to fallout 76 occur because there is greedy and selfish people like this man at the top.
"Seth Cabral these decisions have been made for over a decade, if you actually played Fallout 3"
The Looinrims True. Who knew horse armor in the elder scrolls would have eventually led to this lol. So many more examples of that as well.
"Seth Cabral just look at the game design, Strat-Edgy did an excellent video on what he called “the insidious design of modern fallout games”"
The Looinrims I’ll give it a look. Seems interesting.
Well I’m not sure if they monetize the perk cards but they did create fall out first so they went above and beyond your projected stupidity
Just came here to say that other joe was right... fuck this game.
Didn't they say that if they added more space to the stash boxes it would have break the game but yet her is fallout  first and  adding an infant  stash box for your junk aren't they just contradicted themselves
bro why not go down to the studio and c if u can talk to them and c if there is something that can be done
Millions bro?
"Love the fallout series, but i seen this disaster game coming and avoided like the plauge."
Should do a post-launch interview with Rib eye steak man
Oooh.....so Goerge R.R. Martin is a game reviewer now. Joe could you please slap George and tell him we want the last book already?!
"I will never buy from bethesda ever again. Not only did they lie about the game but what about the collectors edition? Tha canvas bag??

I have never seen so much dissrespect to a customer. Litteraly stealing and fraudulent behaviour towards the customer. 

This isnt just some “Oh well we tried but we were rushed sorry it didnt turn out like we promised” 

No, not at all. This was from the beggining to the end “lets fraud these fools” they dont deserve ANY sympathy! 

I bough the outer worlds which si better than anything bethesda has put out in a loong time. Fuck bethesda I hope they go out of bussines, shameless scammers!

Even EA and Activision watch in shock and probably taking some notes from bethesda on how completely fuck over their customers. Bravo Bethesda, you showed the world there are new lows still to be achieved in the gaming industry. An out right fraud"
they sold a million copies - why should they care then lol
A game so bad that this video was recommended a year later just to remind me how much worse it's gotten
Sixteen times the detail!
On those dollar bills
"They need to go back to fallout 3 joe, just saying lol loved that game lol"
You honestly were way to kind you should have given it a zero
will it go free to play 😂 a year on they're charging $100 a year subscription service 😂😂
Madam of Mystery quest was the only good/interesting quest
Lol yea 2 3 months alright.
55:42 Delrith truly predicted the NPCs would be found dead
"""will this game go free to play?"" if you only knew guys... if you only knew..."
It needs a lot but an offline mode would be one step in the right direction 😉
"The final nail in the coffin for me was the release of fallout 1st which made the game a pay to win now. They totally ruined the franchise, please Bethesda sell the rights to fallout to a game company that cares about making fallout a cool game thank you."
Just replay older Fallout games.
"Since this video
- Various Hacks
- Terrible Battle Royale
- More Bugs
- Mold Helmets
- Fallout ""Fuck you"" First
Wow! Bethesda has become Bethetic."
"Bethetic is right on point! Have my upvote, sir!"
Bethesda is joining EA on the dark siiiiide.  But the rebellion will RISE! UNITE! And fight against the wrath of Corporate Commander's blight!
I'm here after Fallout 1st.
Will it go Free to Play. No. charge $100 a year?
🤣
CALL YOUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES! Demand AJS ratings mandatory for all video games. I can't always watch a 20-60 minute review to know how bad bad the micro transactions are in the latest games.
Fallout 1st has given players a reason to pvp :)
"Me watching in November 2019 - “Oh Joe, if you only knew what they had planned for FO76.”"
"thats crazy after all the shit theyve done even these guys are still riding that ship. poor bastards... bethesda is dead, there is no more elder scrolls there is no more anything. pandoras box has been opened todd has shown his true colors and they will not go back unless they get hit hard right now and as far as i can tell they still somehow making money so they wont care. expect this same shit in your elder scrolls games and any future release from this company. i guess there really is no true despair without some level of hope. rip bethesda."
Amazing that bethesda managed to fuck up SO much more since even after the release when this came out
HOW ABOUT $100 USAGE FEE.  THE OPPOSITE OF FREE.
"Seeing the part about the AI sitting in place as you kill it, didn't the mothman sit in place as you kill it?"
Omg 16:00 you tricked poor souls into buying the shitter version do your homework bri
"In the future Todd will just cut out the middlemen and charge you 60 dollars to slap you in your face.
It'll be sixteen times the slapping."
Joe sounds drunk lol
"Man this game was hilarious on launch, I immediately broke the game and got almost infinite ammo. 0/10"
Who else is watching this again after fallout 1st? Lol
My favorite mission was waiting in that fucking dmv to get a fucking id
lol I love how they predicted the game was going to go FTP and Bethesda went the opposite way with their broken subscription system
"Pretty much lol. What sucks is they have a fantastic map, with a pretty solid building system/scavenging to support your building and crafting. But the devs literally give zero fucks about anything, never test any of it, and only want to milk the community dry. Then they try to add a subscription like ESO... even though the game is hollow in comparison... 

It doesn't HAVE TO BE... but they don't do shit to fix that fact lol."
"Have to say, he was right. I was willing to give them a shot. Since ESO was such a dumpster fire, and Joe didn't revisit it after it was made MUCH better imo. I assumed he was doing the same with FO76... but he was right. 

A year later and nothing has been improved lol, and i mean nothing. If anything they just swapped out one bug for 3 others. 10/30/2019 over a year later, FO76 is in a worse state than it was when it launched. 

No joke. It's just monetized nostalgia. 

They had a great world, with some very good base building mechanics that needed expanded upon... but nope... they've done literally nothing lol. Just pump out bs Atom store items and a broken, half assed raid."
"After all these years I’m still waiting for someone to actually explain why the game engine is at any fault, instead of everyone parroting each other I want to hear some technical KNOWLEDGE, but whatever people are simple creatures that subscribe to mob mentality and mob ignorance. And I’m not even defending the game, just wanna know what’s wrong or not wrong with the ENGINE"
The engine wasn't built for online activity... it's really that simple. When playing the game you can see this very clearly lol.
"i cant “see it clearly” because i dont look at the code while play, and you didnt even answer the question, what was the point of your response? to be a useless smartass?"
The secret shady boss at Bethesda is the Master from Fallout 1.
Hahaha
"My friend game shared it with me, I want a refund"
10 months later - FO76 is just as buggy.
"Bullshit! 

It's way worse now."
I think this review needs DLC
"O.J. wins the base price increase prediction! (base only...)
 47:10"
Copy and paste video games? Good job Methesda!
unfortunately Dell not even a year on is the game free to play they now charge you $100 to play an even buggier version of it
Lol truth.
"Over 2 million views.  WOW!

Bethesda.... Stop it, get some help"
What's Del's complete name? I'd like to find his YouTube channel.
"He doesn't have a channel, he does a lot of work on Joe's Channel. Same thing on Twitch."
 @nightrat42  Thanks!
"Everyone: This game is so broken, only Free to play could make it might worth a visit!
Bethesda: Ohh have a 100$ anual subscribtion! The game is still not Free to play...lolmao!"
I started fallout 4 and i was like fallout 76 is $20 and i got it but im thinking if i should keep playing 4 or put it aside for another title on my to do list.
"That is absolutely so funny joe said he thinks hes a ""hard hittin"" journalist lol 😆 lol"
So much for going free to play lol 60$ new sub system
Funny thing is. Joe was actually right about the Austin team thing:
Why do you justify micro transactions if it goes free to play? They already have are money. The perks are primed for M T
“The drums are sounding in the deep.” That smooth reference to LoTR
Yes!
A lawsuite is nesacery for them to change because thing about this dramatic change takes a dramatic twist of events this lawsuit hooefully will get them to open their eyes then their never going to do it again i hope
"When Other Joe gets banned from show
Del: ""Mohr time Fohr my drum solo!"""
Todd is a n idiot bhetesda eployes ore all idiots they not have a big fwwwwwkin engine to maickin a big multiplayer high map
Fallout 76 more like fallout -76
"stop misusing the word ""literally"""
Yeah good job Todd not even gonna look at elder scrolls 😂
Nice beard big boy
The little engine that could
It's been almost a  year I got the game for free and I still have zero interest in this dumpster fire.
Fallout 76 absolutely deserves a Netflix documentary explaining what happened
"#  Microtransactions, loot boxes, season passes should die out in future games completely on console. On mobile games like joe said yeah I get that too. But  on  Certain mobile games that's how I feel about it 😑😑😑 dam I miss the🎮🕹🎭 80s,90s, early 2000s games when none of this shit  Existed  Micro transactions, loot boxes,  season passes on games on console games .😑😑😑🎮🕹🎭"
"Bethesda would you plz fix your game plzzzz come on . Idk if your going to read our comments  or if even care about your fan base it feel like you do not care about what we say about your game but look plz fix your game .I haven't played this game or even buy it yet because ppl , friends told me not to buy this game because of its bugs , the  Graphics is good at times and then it fuck up at times or kick the player out of the game completely. I'm a big fan of your work on the old fallout games yes it was  Buggy at times but I bet your new game fallout 76 much worse . I thought   Companies like your self care about your fans ,players alike deeply but you have become money hoes and you let greed get the best of you like EA,  Bungie, and  Activision."
There is also a raid now for end game
"""I think blades will be one of the best mobile games"" hah"
BethEAsda
"It sounds like all the shitty GTA online people should move to fallout 76. Theres no benefit to killing someone, but tons of people do it anyway. Just to be pieces of shit."
Been about a year since this travisty has been unleashed upon the masses and it's still not f2p
"Regardless of how much this game is shit on, some need to look past the shitty outside and dig deeper to find the real gem in the game. I understand people not liking the game, but this is only because the game casts a small net. If you dont like the game, cool, but dont shit on bethesda because your specific needs are satisfied. This game is not for everyone."
"27:00 OJ speaks again, with his silky smooth voice, I love him, Marry me Jose, even if you're already married to Joe and Del."
Wtf
wtf dude
"17:32 first time OJ talks in the video, he said some impressive stuff, it was worth the wait. Love You Jose!"
I probably put like 5 hours into this game at launch after the BETA was done and it was supposed to be the final release. Questing sucks but I want to open it back up to explore the world. That might take me another 10 hours before I'm done. When I buy games I want to be able to get 60 hours for $60. $1/hour. That's why I prefer open world games. Not only does it have a story I can do like every other game. It has exploration and side quests. So far Skyrim on PC has been the best value at $10 on sale and over 400 hours between the original release and special edition.
He pulled a Peter Molyneux.
I like del more than that new guy who hosts it the other guys a douche
Still priced at $39.99
9 months later game still f**ked up
I actually had a friend in highschool who said this game was good. I feel very sorry for him
I’ll be honest I used to not really like Del  but I feel like he’s gotten way more comfortable and talks way more and I love him
What if they fu%k up doom eternal
When's the ps2 release
How many hours a day was Del playing this POS?
42:52 Sorry Joe but no. It wasn't good. I'm sure you were disappointed like hell.
What is Joe's censorship policy? I haven't watched many of his videos but he bleeps himself most of the time and another 25% of the time it slips through.
🎵 tell me lies tell me Sweet Little lies 🎵
Corporate Commander had a hand to play in all this.
"""Vaults are going to open""
Bethesda: New dungeons are vaults"
I got a refund and it's the best thing I did.
best bits 55:40  57:02
"That patch in february brought some life quality changes, but this does not outdo to negatives. Less ammo production, power cores get used faster, legendary enemys spawn less"
"I am never gonna buy this ""game"". Digital manure like this ""game"" has absolutely zero usefulness. At least real manure makes your lawn look nice.
PS. They really have to stop programming their own games. They suck at it. They've always sucked at it."
Aaaaand they are bring back NPC Del's wrong xD
"Almost 1 year after release, what a joke."
You know a game is bad when you can get the spacial edition new for 15 bucks and are still on the fence...
"Eh, I’m having fun with it, but I only had to buy it for $8, so I got more than my money’s worth"
Fired this game up once more because for some reason I still have hope. It's still a boring chore. Save time and drive space and move along.
"I'd buy Other Joe's Fallout 76 for $5, but only if he Signs it....and then it would only be for the autograph.  Maybe another $10 if all three autograph it, and do so to my attention."
That's how a Bethesda game explodes. By lies.
This vid aged so fucking well lol
"still getting one star legendary items from three star bosses, getting unbalanced hordes of high level enemies swarming you randomly in dumb situations, still getting frozen enemies, sometimes getting invincible enemies, most often point blank shots will do no damage. 


Idk why I still play, it feels like the patches are making the game worse rather than better....also the other game modes aren't any better"
Bro let em know this game is just not good
Just uninstall that piece of digital junk.
Why stop your being a part of the problem ps plz tell you still don't tell me
 @jbarton291  because I still spent 70 bucks on it? lol
I still get stuck in power armor lmao. And lots
"Damn 2018 was a shitty year for gaming...we had SJW/broken battlefield 5, we had The infamous fallout 76 and we had the boring ass Red dead online...damn...better luck this year...please"
"This is like having a support group for those if us who feel victimized by bethesda lol....Can you give a link to Del""s channel.... And thank you for funny and truthful reviews, Joe. 😁"
I think del only livestreams on twitch and he only does it on the angryjoe twitch channel.
 @AlphaNinjaFTW1  thanks!
"In order to make a score on a product, any kind of product, you firstly need to have a working product for itself.
If this would be a car z You will be able to start your engine, but the steering wheel would be missing, no windows, and only the gas pedal would be there.
After this ""car review"" the score would be non existing. So it will equal to 0/10"
you get what you pay for! ya feel?
Del is THE most obvious virgin ive ever seen in my life xD
I'm so sorry that you had to spend $200 of your own money on that piece of shit excuse for a game
Imagine getting to 180 in this shit
Why is this pos game still 70 bucks on PSstore!?
how about Fall out 76 on the Nintendo Switch
Because you forgive Bethesda their bugs is why they never improve any of the games they put out. Mods wont always save these God awful games
Blades is worse than 76 if you can believe it
Started playing July 2019. Still a bad game. But it's fun.
"The problem isn't the engine but how you use it. This same engine is used with success in many modern games with no breaking bugs, why? Because good developers just don't copy/paste the engine as it is, implements it with other party  copy/pasted physics, and expect it to work with no tuning. Bethesda is lazy for money. I wonder if not spending that few ONE TIME extra thousands bucks for fine tuning was worth it."
I really think you should have kept this game a 2/10. It doesn't deserve that extra point.
Rewatching for the lols
3:57 I completely and respectfully disagree with your opinion here. The Engine is basically a fucking fossil at this point. I really REALLY hope they change it.
"Wierdly enough every time I come back to this video I feel it longer, it might be because of all the things that this game dose wrong that this video reminds me of, idk"
To sum up fallout 76: Boy...did you waste your time
"and yes, the perks were originally monetised. people dug into the files and found evidence. and, also yes, it was solely because of battlefront 2."
lol babyface
"I stopped buying games at release. I don't regret it either.  Now all I need to do is wait out the hype and for the player base to lose interest, then these companies try to rekindle interest with dlc versions and GOTY versions at discounted rates. I pay an average of $25 for triple A titles now. Got witcher 3 and horizon zero dawn complete editions for $20 each new. Still havent even played witcher yet."
Bethasda are a One-Engine-Wonder. They dont have anything new to offer.
So one bad game and everyone is trying to blow up the headquarters
I'm hyped for TES 76.
Sixteen times the detail
with pubg mobile you get a temporairy item for around 20 dollar
"Todd is all talk... even though he has the background and the know how, this game happened, the developers are becoming lazy and lying pieces of shit who are trying their hardest to get the money at all costs and they don’t even have the courtesy to make a game that you want to spend on because they think you are dumb enough to eat their shit and not complain. This is their self deserved cash in for all the shitty stuff they’ve deuced on our collective chests starting at fallout4 on... something happened in that company around that games development that chased the creative minds largely away I think."
If i would of got 200$ Edition an got that shity bag an they gave me a response like that i would of Grab the most badass layer an Sue the live'ing hell out of them
Fast forward to E3 2019...Joe was right about them adding human NPC.
Yea Del was so confident it wasn't happening lolol
PC Gamer said it's getting human NPCs. I bet they're half-assed bullshit ones though
Why can't they fix it like they did elder scrolls online you guys don't know what you are talking about I'm a big fan of you guys but you never gave elder scrolls online another chance you just made a review and never looked at it lately you gave mass effect 3 another chance with the extended cut so you should do another review of elder scrolls online please Joe just check it out
Why can't fallout 76 fix everything like elder scrolls online. Elder scrolls online was horrible when it first came out now look at it its the best mmo ever don't believe me look it up it has the most players and great reviews now they started off terrible and really fixed everything they went above and beyond why can't fallout 76 do the same thing
I heard it's only bad because of the glitches i guarantee it will be fixed remember when angry Joe was upset about elder scrolls online when it first came out but now it's the greatest mmo game ever made they fixed i wish angry Joe would give elder scrolls online another chance because it's not the same game anymore
"You are completely missing the point. ""But now"" it's no excuse  to release games not finished and making them priced as AAA 100$ minimum to enjoy ""the true experience as it was meant to be played"". This are reviews of new releases, and if at release it suks, it just suks. Period. They could have made it as ""But now"" from the start but they didn't, because they need more your wallet and wanted to get away with it. It's beacuse of reviews like this that bethesda did something, otherwise you were served in theyr eyes. Ah, and dont forget to buy Blue for 5$."
no doubt that Betheseda is ruining their REP if they FUBAR ES6 prepare the modding community to rain down fire upon them by modding the hell out of ES6 to the point that it will look like this  pirate>mod>profit
"I'm thankfully not a member of the ""Millions"" who paid and fell victim to this Fraud."
"I really like Dell and wish he was in more content, he is hilarious and knows the game really well"
Isn’t it they keep putting fucking Alex in instead of del
 @marksteyne7795  well del made his own channel so they wanted a third person in the group why not alex plus he is pretty good as well 👍
Todd howard fangirls will end up fucking elder scrolls 6 because they don't complain about the shitty game they get handed and Bethesda will keep pulling the same shit over and over again with no consequence.
I spend 3 or 4 months playing fallout 4 it was awsome and after 1 or 2 weeks i was done with fallout 76 lol plus is not a free game when you have to play ps plus to play it on ps4 lol
"21:27 33:58
Just some timestamps I am leaving for myself."
BIG FAT FUCKIN DEL I CAN SMELL HIM FROM HERE
Joe knew that there would be human NPCs
"a game so bad Joe gave it two full videos, this is the better of the two imo"
"""And I think blades will be one of the best mobile games..."" HAHAHAHAHAHA"
He was right to worry about those microtransactions it made blades very bad
"WORSE The game... after trying and trying to get on with it is complete f**cking shit!  I have played from the start... all the glitches, bugs,  weapon nerfing, camp closures, blue screening, other kicking fr no reason, updates fro hours on end, ghouls that slide across floors that you cant kill, falling through game floors, legendary monsters you spend thousands of ammo on that drop 1 star scrip,  and now the new vending machines that for no reason just empty you whole inventory so you camp doesn't show up on the map and you have to populate and price every item you sell over and over (sometimes 120 vending slots) I've had enough.... don't buy it really... and every update and bug fix they do... another pops up worse, and every new event they bring out you still get crap if you complete it.... its the best concept but the worst game I have ever played... maybe some players should start suing them. IT IS NOTHING BUT  DIGITAL COCONUT SHY WITH ALL THE DAMN COCONUTS NAILED TO THE SHY POSTS... you try for a while but after throwing the balls hundreds of times as hard as you try the coconut just don't fall off... when a game is no longer fun, it is no longer a game.... this is utterly crap.... I just though if something else crap too... and then forgot whil typing... and I really cant be arsed even trying to remember any more.... IT IS SHIT.... YOU WILL GET BURNED.... oh yes i remembered... now it lags like cray.... so when your in battle r like rd zone - you lag - and just end up waking up a bag on the floor with all you junk in - if you do get back and pik it up before another player takes it your lucky... and if you get to beat the monster your fighting guess what... you still usually get 1 start scrip... f*ck all incentive - 101% frustration and pissed off... but dont believe me - go on and spend you well earned money on it and find out for yourself... good luck... ITS F*CKED - INCOMPLETE AND ARE REAL DAMN SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Del just makes shit up so he can talk more. ""70% of the player base is experiencing this problem"". ""Nobody wants PvP in Fallout 76"""
"I wish I knew how to send links on mobile but, after watching this video of course, type in ""Todd Howard It Just Works"" for a wonderful song about Bethesda"
Fallout 4 has never had a FOV slider...
Bug men took my moo moo
"i'm terrified for elder scrolls 6. If it's on the creation engine there's no way i can make myself buy it. Even if it's not, simple game design choices make Bethesda games feel so dry. If they implemented better AI, better animations, desirable loot, non-level-scaling loot/enemies, visible NPC levels, and a more robust leveling system (respeccing, XP gains for killing enemies), they would solve 90% of their problems."
Let's face it.. FO76 was not meant to be a blockbuster.. FO76 was an attempt at providing minimum viable product while being sacrificed to see if they can monetize singleplayer RPGs. This was a beta test for their underhanded sales tactics.. nothing more. Testing the waters so to say.
And Todd basically proved you right in the IGN interview by admitting he knew it wouldn’t be a highly reviewed game.
Wow
"Lol ""i dont care if this gets 100 views.""
Gets 1.8 Million views as of 6/18/2019"
WROOOOONG!
and here it is six months later and it has gottin better
fallout 76 has no story and is online some people don't play online
I just got this game for 10 bucks lol
"Turns out Bethesda was selling us a... Fable. A Molyneux-redux, if you will."
"Don't give Todd the benefit of the doubt. Don't forget. Whether it's his fault or the fault of those above him, HE is still the one that lied to your face. I'm not forgiving Randy Pitchford for lying to me and I'm not forgiving Todd."
"TES: Blades, one of the best mobile games. HAH. Hahahahaha. An Infinity Blade rip-off with the worst aspects of Dungeon Keeper: Mobile grafted on."
Piece of dog shit game from a piece of dog shit company.
"45:44 we shipped the game yesterday


If u get this joke you are a level 15 chad"
Joe was right! Human NPC's lol.
worst fallout game in history
"Man, all 1000+ Fallout 76 players disliked this video. Good for them."
"fallout 76 is crap Oxhorn raved about how great it was so like an idiot i bought it only to find it bland and boring and now all Oxhorn does is walk threw the game 76 reading story lines and boring every one to death even though he is also doing a series on FALLOUT 2 which is far more interesting and fun all he does is one video a week on FALLOUT 2 and Fallout 3 the rest of the week it's 76 lore and it's so boring i try""d to trade my fallout 76 for another game at every store i went to told me they had to many 76 games that people traded for another game there over stocked on fallout 76 biggest complaint was it's boring and they don't buy Fallout  games for PLAYER VS PLAYER they buy it for the interesting people you meet the factions you can join and a great story line and 76 isn't that"
Follout Shelter is better then Follout 76 :)
"Welp time to go back to fallout 3, 4, and new vegas."
Is it still shit?!
no but there are WAY better games out there
it went from 2/10  to 5/0.
"Bethesda approached the generator they thought fallout 76 is a god not a glitchy game, so they collect samples and other patches after weeks when the game is out..."
11 years later. This is the gold standard 😂
"it's hilarious how people are putting this game on a pedestal compared to bf6, this game dogwater on launch compared to bf6 launch."
People either have short memories or they were little kids back then and didn't know any better
Why is this on my home page youtube?
LOL this is a certified hood classic
I came back in 2025
$60 for games. We didn’t know how good we had it.
seeing it crash to the windows 7 desktop was kinda nostalgic
I’m pretty sure Del is dead.
Who is here in 2025 waiting for the bf6 launch?
50 DOLLARS NOW IS 100 BRO
aint no way im paying 100 for ANY game. I'll wait for at least 30% off
11 Years later and I still return to this
Thank you guys for the hard work
"Ah, what a great time capsule when we were still talking about $50 dollar games being a thing of the past."
Still fascinating to see that one of the best Battlefield games had one of the worst launches😂
2042 had a very similar launch but it could never be like bf4
EA fault for forcing dice to releasd a new game 2 years after bf3 just dropped
"No matter how good BF6 looks, remember this game.
DO NOT PRE-ORDER."
It's a trap lol.
I love that this video exists and also that BF4 became the de facto standard of a great BF game.
"I feel like this would happen the same in BF6 at launch. Everyone will be pissed for the bad server and crashes, then few months or a year later, everything is fixed, hate has died down, everyone will say it's the best thing ever.

It's a cycle."
Who’s here after battlefield 6 trailer to remind there friends who forgot 4 was a dumpster fire on release
Who would've thought that after more of a decade this will be last true BF game and we will beg to EA to make another BF game like this and 3 was :(
Battlefield 1 was one of the best Battlefield games
"2025/2026: ""Battlefield 6 has stopped working""

lmao"
Thanks to Dice LA For fixing the game 🎮 it was so messy especially on PS3
Old good days let see Battlefield 6
This is nostalgic AF.
this was peak AngryJoe.
"Can't believe this is 11 years old already. This was among the times when the decline of gaming first started. 
Joe also doesn't quite rant like this anymore, this was art."
8:36 xd
"I have to come back to this every now and then. Best rant I've seen until, or since."
Jeez this was over a decade ago. Crazy. Game is the best one now. Lol
If only we knew how good we had it even at those low points...
Battlefield 4 is not a good game.
Ur an idiot
"games have always had issues that's why crack websites existed back in the day, and why steam revolutionized gaming. pc gaming has always had issues since like the 90s and consoles started getting issues with the xbox360 and PS3 from what i remember. 
back then you had to wait much longer for fixes, and they were harder to download, and so much more. 
games have gotten a lot better it's just that people always focus on the negatives."
this is so fucking funny i always come back to this video when my wife beats me
i come back to this everytime my batlefield crashes its so fucking funny
Pure Golden Legendary Quote is born.
1:31 You done f&*ked it up!! 8:52 FIX THIS S&*T NOW!!!!
Angry Quotes are born from a bad rushed game.
"I’m coming back from 2024 and they never changed a thing. Doesn’t crash but fuck it’s still not good. Am I still paying it? Yes



HOT TAKE battle feild is a FPS league of legends"
I just figured out he never made a bf 4 review or bf 5 or bf1
Legendary
"In retrospect, yes this game was a technical disaster at launch but god damn is it amazing nowadays. 9/10."
"Oh boy, the road we had ahead. And what bs is yet to come."
Oh only if 10 years ago Joe would have known the disasters that would release years later on
I played COD Warzone this morning and after crashed game on wrong time i threw my gear and rage quit gaming for the rest of the day. I remembered this video 😂❤
"Omg win 7, this vid is old."
This never gets old
Who knew that history would repeat itself with 2042 (still garbage today...)
Still one of the best rants
BF4 is great now.
"Thank god,we needed to be reminded from a 10yr video...."
"I feel like I'm one of the few people that hated BF4 over BF3. BF4 had the same damn issues present in the beta in the full release.

Let's not mention the terrible hit reg, weird, randomized bullet deviation and the fact that the game has too fucking many vehicles making ground to vehicular combat so unbalanced."
😂
"10 years already, what the hell"
is this a 2042 review?
"looks at the calendar 
Huh, 9 years later and this shit still happens lmfao damn"
Too often
It’s even worse now in my opinion cause it not just ea doing it. now it’s about 90% of the triple A company’s
Oldie but a goodie a good old classic
"U could tell he was pissed .. are u fuccin serious Oh ,no ,oh okay"
"Ah, gaming. Hasn't changed."
WTF IS DIGITAL DELUXE ☻️
When I played the game I was instantly disappointed the gunplay just didn't feel right
"bf4 being bad in 2013:
- people angry
bf4 in 2023: one of the greatest battlefields ever created

bf2042 being bad in 2021:
- people angry





2042 one day will be the greatest of all time"
Difference is that 2042’s core gameplay design is trash
 @mikesmith145  that's subjective. Bugs aren't
 @WatdaFrag  not subjective when that’s the common consensus
 @mikesmith145  if the common consensus is made up by people who didn't even play it.. then ok. But we who play 2042 think it's not as bad as people say.
Nope 2042 isn't a battlefield game  been 1 year and are you stupid most of the fan base has moved to the older games
"Naa people played it, over 100k on steam, now it gets objectivly less than BFV, 2042 is straight cut garbage"
 @WatdaFrag  I own it and played it each time a new patch came out. I don't like the core gameplay at all. Vehicles especially feel extra arcade-like.
 @mikesmith145 It’s in line with Hardline
I mean i got today for 8 dollars
“Dice wouldn’t let something this buggy come out the door” how wrong he was and how wrong he always will be about dice😂
"And EA took that personally and said ""fuck you, here's 2042"""
This will never not get old
"Battlefield 4: A great game with a terrible unstable launch, wracked with bugs. 
Battlefield 2042: An awful game with a terrible unstable launch, wracked with bugs."
Still think Battlefield Bad Company 1 & 2 are the pinnacle of the franchise. Why can’t DICE just do the right thing and make Bad Company 3? Instead of regurgitate this half assed crap.
"Still relevant nearly a decade later. Fucking travesty, man. Fuck EA."
Don't worry I'll buy a copy in your name
"120 dollars for a game in 2013, my goodness gracious."
*120 dollars to Beta Test their product for free
Hard to believe this game actually got better
Years later and it still resonates.
HoF video
Who's back here from battlefield 2042
To this day this is still one of the BEST rants Angry Joe has ever done! YEAH!!
1:59 Joe yelling and screaming kills me every time lmao
Just a lil taste of things to come
2022 and EA never changes
1:41
Wenotowetouanything
"It's because despite the expensive (and transparent)PR, there's a lot of prejudice towards 'the gamer' and with today's slimy tactics it's clear which term they apply to us each of us:

                  A D D I C T"
This is what you'd love to 'Clockwork Orange' each and every board member. It would be a start.
He lived another day to witness battlefield2042
fail ??still better than 1 to 2042
This was before the state of bf4 currentlyt. Bf4 was almost as bad as 2042 with all the bugs and glitches
dude this was made in 2013
 @broodingsoap9469  lol
 @monkeybenchmarks  lol
The Best Angry Joe Moment of All Time. And it’s aged perfectly given 2042’s disasterous launch.
Yep
"This has to be the greatest rant ALL TIME!!!
I just started playing BF4 again the last month daily, what a classic, it's still great.
Never tried 2024, I just knew, cause of all the stuff that';s been happening in the last couple of years.
But I did watch he review of it, then came here out of curiosity as I'm currently playing BF4 again.

OHH MY LORD what a great Review, I was laughing each time he exploded. this is classic rant.
I like how his energy goes down at 5:50, and I thought he burnt himself out, NOPE!!! LOLOL 🤣😂🤣😂

EDIT: I have tears in my eyes, I rewatched the last part when he says about servers, ""Here comes EA< NOPE!!! NOPE!!!"" LOLOL 🤣😂🤣😂EPIC can't even describe this masterpiece."
It's still broken in 2022. 4 headshots from a sniper rifle still don't kill an enemy. Heli targeting system still doesn't work. Crashes galore. It's like a fun sponge.
Some things never change.
You could tell someone that he's talking about 2042 and they wouldn't know any different LMAO. I went from crying laughing from playing the beginning over and over before realizing it wasn't a skit. It legit crashed during the stream.....damn XD.
Should we go back in time and tell younger AJ about BF2042?
Who's here after 2042?
"OMG!
Your bullets actually hurt people in this game!
it's already better then 2042!
They should just scrap 2042 and make a clone of 4!
And then add all the cool stuff from 2042 to it!"
"Haha! This has aged equally bad as it has aged well…
Keep fighting the good fight joe!"
And now we have 2042....
😂😂😂 amazing how this lazy cookie cutter map design of a game is considered the best in franchise. BF2 > BF3 > BF4 > BFHL > BF1 > BF5 > 2042 ANYONE notice a pattern here?
Looks like EA saw the v
Video
In my opinion they sucked after Bad Company.
Battlefield 4 is 8 years old now!?
"yes, but evern WAY BETTER than SHitfield 2042"
"And here we are, in 2022 BF4 is the best BF of all time."
Dude this game was the the best battlefield we will ever have gotten
This is an 8 year old video back then this game was pure garbage this is before any of the patches that eventually fixed all the issues
End of 2021 and I’m coming back to watch this. It is amazing how many loyal dogs keep buying this EA drivel and accepting it because it’s all they are going get.
somehow this video guves me hope for battlefield 2042
Bellevue far is now a masterpiece thanks for the failure that was 2042.
"Past joe had no idea how bad things would get, battlefield 4 is fundamentally the last great battlefield game"
"2042 was like my final hope into them getting it right and not dick their loyal paying player base around, but nope...shits gone on long enough, good riddance"
How could you not like bf 4? The mp was a step up over bf3
Because it was super buggy at launch. Way worse than BF2042. But people tent to forget….
BF 2042 is soooooooooo much worse it’s not even close.
After 2042 launched I thought I could go back to Warzone but now that’s shit… just playing BF4 again.
"Best angry reaction, can tell by the tone by boy Joe putting in that  work; frustration in it 👌."
So it looks like this franchise actually died a long time ago.
mah!
Watching almost 10 years later and these companies are still a f joke..
"why the hate at their first year, i'm not trying to defend EA as their lawyer but... look what happened now to BF4, it becomes one of the best BF out of all.

so give it time and i have a feeling that BF2042 will be a solid game"
 @kostationable   Why do they ask full price day one if it is not working day one?
Now we only wish bf42 was like bf4 T-T
"a game crashes after u finish ur MATCH...no sir i don't want em here on the start of BF2042.
sure it's buggy but it's playable...Loadout bug? sure just leave and start again and u okay. The only thing i saw and it was a huge problem was when u die you got that bug that u can't do anything until the game ends, and i think they already fixed that"
" @kostationable  convenient ""sures"" doesn't really cut it lol

My dude bf4 with its bugs had more bones in terms of gameplay content than bf2042 by a huge amount, bugs aside (cuz we got used to them), bf2042 is not a bf game anymore, nearly all elements that made battlefield is gone in bf2042, literally everything except the name battlefield and rideable vehicles (which even that suffered a cut on naval vehicles)

so again, bf4>bf2042, any time of any day in any year on any universe"
Funny how the problems he outlined are the same as with 2042 release.
so glad BF4 evolved and became one of the best military FPS ever
"took it like 9 months to be so 
not acceptable .. i bought it at launch day and been BF fan since BC2"
I thought it was a BF2042 rant for a sec
"The comment ""Dice wouldn't let something this buggy"" Hasn't aged well"
"Watching this afther the 2042 release just worries me, Cus ever since BF4 release there games has been declining HUGE in every release, now with 2042 they just pushed the line and its a worse money grap than hardline was, At least hardline has meaning compared to 2042, Maby EA can win the golden Poo for worst company in america again with 2042 :D"
Battlefield 1 was good
"""dice wouldnt let something this fucking buggy come out the door"" this comment aged like fine wine lol"
I just knew about joe. Went from 2042 review to bf5 to this. I HOPE THERE WILL CRASH AN ASTROID ON EA HEADOFFICE
oh how low we have sunk since these days. At least bf4 was a solid game beneath the bugs. BF2042 is broken and an insult to the franchise. RIP battlefield
"i have the same feeling about BF2042, it's actually a solid game beneath these bugs."
"But... 2042 is a solid game, needs some work tho"
 @Hunonn1  sarcasm right?
" @ThePumpkinBasher  no, me and a lot of people actually enjoy it now. Update 3.1 really did wonders. Still theres a lot of things that need be done..."
Why did people ever think BF was the superior franchise that was above the CODs again?
Because its downfall began when Battlefield tried to be more like COD
Anything really is above COD's tbh
Oof back when the GTX 780 was new
and look how BF4 turned out to be
And at some point 2042 will do the same
This video aged like milk
"Nah. His reviews like all are on the day of release type and how complete it is. It took BF4 2 years to reach this ""perfection"" state that we know it is today."
" @gman8796  because bf4 had solid bones to work with, bf42 has nothing, no commander mode, no classes, no factions, no proper sound design, no levelotion, nothingggg"
 @xxCrimsonSpiritxx  I agree BF4 as a base had good things in place. I dnt like the specialist at all in bf2042 I would genuinely say that is the thing I hate the most. Unfortunately the other things I can see getting patched or added (which isn't an excuse as it's still bad that it's missing) but they'll never get rid of specialist's as they developed the game around it.
"​ @gman8796  Yeah man, they just added specialists so that they can sell skins, everybody knows this and it was obvious when they started pushing on santa skins before pushing on fixing bugs or adding important mechanics (I know there are different teams that work on those assets, but the idea of pushing something ""no one asked for"" to the public before something ""people asked for"" is my point)

But anyway yeah, so many things have changed in bf2042, no commander mode (which was super fun and teamwork intensive), no classes, minimum to non-existant levelution, and other sticks and stones

These things can't be added without pulling everything on hold and recoding it, which won't happen"
Damn after 2042 lol
"2013. Battlefield 4 releases, sparking a rant. 
it is now 2021. Battlefield 2042 releases, along with a brand new rant. history repeats itself."
Had to revisit this
This aged well.
imagine if he could see in to the future and watch his 2042 review😂
"4:08
i can only laugh in pain after bf2042"
Watching again after the 2042 launch….when will I learn
Returning after 2042. This video has aged very well.
classic
THEY LEARNED NOTHING!!!
this game is one of the best all-time
Life is a cycle...
"Oof this video was a massive foreshadowing to what would happened...
Scratch that already multiple times in the battlefield!"
"i did not realize that the last thing he said in this rant he said in the 2042 rant  ""fix this shit NOW"""
here after the 2042 review
Battlefield 2042?
Tell em' Joe!
"2021, just 2 years after my last comment.  After trying out 2042, that game made me appreciate the older games.  Hell, I uninstalled it hours ago.  Going back to Battlefield 1 and looking to try out BFV in the near future."
Wow... It was back in 2013 but now it's even worse! Welcome to the future. We can't even rent servers at all anymore.
bf4 was way worse stfu
Holy shit GTX 780 was the top of the line stuff back then. Holy shit I'm getting old...
Man has pc issues plus bf 4 is gold 😎
"EA be like. HAHA you thought BF4 was bad, hold my beer and let me show you what REAL bad looks like."
bf4 was way worse u obviously didnt play tyhen
" @ak86db  I don't remember BF4 having hit register issues. I remember crashing, graphical bugs and being unable to join at times. BF4 still had the fundamentals that made Battlefiled, well Battlefield. BF2042 is Fortnite COD and Overwatch combined."
"This game crashed every 5-10 minutes if you watch Angry Joe's video, he highlights everything about the release of both 2042 and BF4."
clearly didnt play bf4
" @ak86db  At this point, I think you're trolling. I played the Battlefield 4 beta and this was a lot worse. Hell, I even pre-ordered that game too."
 @serversideissues4249  dont need to keep proving my point u already did 3 times now
2021 and nothing changed.
hes been ranting since bf4 damn this guy is on track
"Battlefield 2042: Exist
“Perhaps we’re being too harsh for you”"
Battlefield 4 was totally unplayable in 64 player modes with insane rubber banding on PS4 for 6 months after release. But at least the flesh and bones of the game were great. That can't be said for 2042.
“Dice wouldnt let something like this out the door” ....2021 says hi lol
Now Battlefield 4 is the best
I know there are tremendous differences between bf4 and 2042 but this gives me hope
This game is the last golden game they made
What about bf1?
AAH SHIT 2042 AGAIN!
"Not EA, DICE isn't what they used to be, face it, they'll never make a battlefield of the same quality as bad company 1, 2 EVER AGAIN, cause all the actual talent already left the studio."
I think 2042 is gonna go through the same thing.
"Everytime a new Battlefield release, everytime a new bottom line testing to all of the battlefield fan boy"
You could just retitle this to 2042
Dice is back at it again
Ironic
Just replace every time he says 4 with Insert battlefield number/name here and you got yourself a great re-useable meme video!
if only Joe would have known back then that 8 years later there wont even be a scoreboard lol
"I see EA, EA never changes and actually DICE would let something this bad come out, over and over and over again......"
"Crazy how after 8 years and longer, companies are still getting away with releasing half ass garbage games. Sure they become amazing after a million updates a year later. But at what cost??"
Bf4 becomes masterpiece
I found this because I looking  up why Battlefield 2042 is so glitchy...
mannn this hits different in 2021 after the 2042 launch.
I love watching him lose his mind lol. Makes me laugh all the time.
Oh... Damn...
The YouTube algorithm never fails to disappoint
I wish we knew when we are in the good old days before the good old days go away.
Imagine telling this past Joe that $70 is the standard price for games now lmao
"And has the quality of what's being shipped increase at all?   No. No it hasn't.. 

Because these companies realize so many people will still give them money for an unfinished and broken game.."
 @thisisntthewholesomefuture649  that's the reason why i never like modern games and i am not boomer it's just that modern video games all look like crap
These games these days are too much overpriced that way too much over priced at
" @thisisntthewholesomefuture649  the more they do this, the closer I am to the line I drew between piracy and buying games"
"Due to inflation, I still don’t think a $70 price tag is that bad. I feel like we’re lucky to even had a $60 price rage for like 3 console generations."
 @marcoslopez_  you are apart of the problem
"""THEY STILL DUN FUCKED IT UPPPPP WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY AND GOOD TO KNOW EA WILL NEVER GIVE DICE TIME TO FINISH A GAME FUUUUUUCK""

How'd that"
That’s what’s keeping me from buying new games hahah I could barely justify buying a $60 game but $70 is way too fucking much especially when you consider the state of the game and content you get at launch. Remeber when you’d pay $60 for a game and it had content and wasn’t buggy? Yea me neither cuz it’s been that fucking long lol
And now it's $80 with COD BO6 💀
"Welp, it’s $80 now 😊"
You mean $80
 @w12266  About to be $100 with GTA6… (That’s the rumour anyway)
BF4 still fine
Aged like milk in the sun.
"Everyone using this guy as reference point of how BF242 will ruin the franchise


and then exist this video XD"
lol
This will be reiterated with Bf 2042………
Little did he know what comes in 2021...
Who's here after watching bf 2042 angry rant
Best battlefield game
This aged well lmfao
Launches are the bane of dices existence
Enter battlefield 2042…
Wonder if he ever goes back and plays games after he rants... angry joe is a travesty
of course he does but these games take months or years to get fixed
"Don't rely on hindsight mate :)    BF4 was bug filled pile of shit for nearly a year before it turned into a masterpiece

BF 2042 is no different, but Dice should have learned since then"
 @GTChucker86  wait so you said don't rely on hindsight... but then say dice should have known better in HINDSIGHT because of battlefield 4?
" @Kermodo  Tbh saying don't rely on hindsight was kinda stupid on my part.

But nevertheless, Angry Joe's reaction is still valid for its time, BF4 is amazing but we all knew it was a shitshow at first.   Angry Joe shouldn't withdraw his initial statement at all about BF4 cause it wouldn't affect the quality of the game later down the line.  It still improved and then some and some might argue it was videos like these that were the catalyst"
" @GTChucker86  ah okay I see. I was confused. I apologize. I agree. You make a good point. I just wish more content creatora or reviewers would check in on games, to see if their initial criticism is still valid or if thi gs have changed. I just find with AJ he doesn't have much wind in his sails if he has something positive to say about something. He has to be ""angry"" with things. And I get it. Some of his criticism is very true and valid but other parts I find are him digging for something to find wrong with a game."
 Sub Bot  good.
Battlefield 2042 here we come againe!
This video didn't age well.
This aged well
Felt nostalgic after most recent rant. Can believe after all these years they still manage to fuck up worse.
Who’s here after his bf 2042 rant. This rant hasn’t age a bit
Bf is dead 🤣
yes same as cod
 @thesorrow96  srry bro i was talking about the new bf .. i love bf4 i hate cod 😁
Whilst Halo is on the rise again
Rewatching this after the 2042 video is very reassuring. Personally I haven't had a single crash in 2042 but man BF4 I had them constantly
"Exactly. BF4's launch was infinitely worse than this, so if BF4 can bounce back 2042 can as well."
" @TheStrikeofGod  yeah dude i'm ngl, I ofc believe everyone is having these issues, I mean the clips are constantly in my recommended, but personally I haven't gotten any of it. Already have 60 hrs in the game (i know, I have no life) and I haven't seen any of these bugs people are talking about, no crashes, no stuck on revive screen, had one single instance of the hitreg being fucked in my entire time playing, and only seen the can't revive next to wall bug like 2-3 times. Only issue I have had is the FPS but even that's been solved since this update (to be fair I run a 60hz screen so even the absolute best possible FPS I can see may be considered unplayable by some lmao)."
" @Literally_Corn  Meh, feels fine to me."
 @Literally_Corn  What mechanics do you speak of speakO?
 @Literally_Corn  your not saying much?
" @Literally_Corn  first sentence I can tell you don’t play battlefield. Team play isn’t a thing and specialist increase team play. 

Yea certain parts are to open

Vehicles aren’t overpowered. There’s 64 players per side you just don’t want to destroy it so you complain. 

Yeah spread is trash. 

70 weapons, they had to re balance portal guns they didn’t just copy and paste. 

Yeah server browsers is needed, same with chat.

Gameplay is actually pretty movement is close enough to bf5 which is the best movement, and yeah EA forced yet another game to release early"
" @Literally_Corn  we had 64 players for a long time now. I welcome the increase player count. 

Vehicles were always overpowered. That's how it is theirs nothing we can't do.

I'm not to botherd by the specialist system but I understand what you mean."
At least bf4 was fun. The crashes in pc during launch were bad tho!!!
Exact words Joe used for BF2042 @8:52
Angry Joe should include this same clip @6:24 when reviewing BF2042
"after watching bf 2042 rant, knowing that bf4 is the best bf game of all time, i already know, we all good with 2042... lolzz"
BF4 best battlefield? That's a good joke
 @timetraveler5547   for many it is.
 @HayateAzekura  and for others it's isn't so it's debatable
If you could step back in time and tell him what would come up with 2042... 8 years later... I bet he would have started to love BF4
"He did love BF4 when it worked at that point and later on when it was stable, he mentioned it in his Battllefield Hardline review."
Lul Angry Joe is realy... angry
Hands up you here after watching his BF2042 rant?
"Ahh Shit Here we go, AGAIN"
history repeats itself
0:41 my reaction to BF2042
Back in the day when crashes were the only thing that you could rant about in a new Battlefield release..
"Every bf had crashes and log in bugs. But it was fun gameplay 
Now its just a media circus"
Bruh I fuckin hate the battlefield players like bro who camps the same spot on the roof the whole game. Fuckin virgins came out the womb too soon.
 @ricksanchez191  battlefield is suppose to be teamwork-type game if you want a movie blockbuster type game just play cod mw remastered
bro bf4 was literally far more bugged than 2042
​ @WatdaFrag The fuck no way that's true xd
 @Empty12345  nah hella true
" @WatdaFrag  We can simply compare:
Bf4 had crashing & server issues, but underneath a decent game.

Bf2042 had same issues plus was literally a broken mess and underneath an embarassing pile of shit game."
"Bro with BC2, BF3 and BF4 they had waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more issues than just crashes around the releases."
"Battlefield 2042; ""Hold my beer"""
Lmao 😂
Yep. Nothing changed. Maybe even only got worse. Lmao... 🤡🤡🤡 I never bought any BF game since 3. Thank god! Thanks Joe!
yeah bf 2042 wasn't just ea's bad it was dice too witch is just sad
Hold my Soy
Lol!!!!
 @chadfang2267  yeah. They did it with battlefront 2.l as well. Luckily they fixed battlefront 2 and made it one of the best dice games ever. Battlefront is hands down the best multiplayer game I’ve played in the last decade.
Fun thing is bf 4 is now one of the favorite games.
I just searched for this video after his legendary battlefield 2042 rant
"says how good bf4 was in bf2042 review

Well...  Atleast bf4 had good gameplay!"
Lol who else comparing this to 2042 ?
1:25 what happened to bf4 being the best oh wait it took months for it to be good . So stop bashing 2042
Anyone here after seeing his Battlefield 2042 rant video?
YUP
Kinda
"I honestly don't get it. 2042 is rough yeah, but saying it's the ""worst BF launch"" is a laugh.

BF4 literally did not work."
True but the gameplaybwasn't as flawed and even improved on bf3 in some ways.
8 years later..... Nothing changed.... Hovercraft 2042
Man coming here after his BF 2042 rant is both hilarious and sad
Hahah came here after watching Angry rant of BF 2042! Complete DEJA VU!
Coming here after watching his 2042 rant. History repeats itself 😂
"After 8 years, we are back here :)"
Here to see if BF2042 is as bad as BF4’s launch
I commented here 5 months ago saying imagine the game comes out broken. I guess I predicted it 😂
 @taransingh9548  Lmao
Ah there is hope for bf2042
I watched the bf 2042 video and came back. To see how was it
This just proves that things can get better. BF4 was a disaster at launch as well but now it's well liked by the community.
Exactly
"Problem is the fundamentals of Battlefield were still in BF4. BF2042 takes radical risks that frankly puts its very identity into question. Remember the days when DICE came up with their own design decisions that put it into a league of it's own instead of copying RS6, Warzone and the like? I certainly do and at this point much like Bioware, DICE is dead and they aren't coming back. Period."
" @ShadowSnowLeopard95  Games change over time. Battlefield can't stay the same forever.

Besides, 2042 still feels like Battlefield imo."
The sad thing is that it can't already be better on Day One
 @TheStrikeofGod  your joking lmao
" @unknownwill4th549  

Cod fans: Vanguard is reskinned of mw19, same perks, same killstreaks, same mode. Nothings changed

Bf fans: Why do you need to change? We don't like specialists! Just bring back class system back and same battlefield experience. It Feels like cod already."
Who's here after Battlefield 2042?
Coming back here after watching the most recent video for 2042 makes me hopeful that the newer game can be made better. Everyone now adays wants to go back to BF4 and using this video as a reminder can see that these releases are pretty rocky. It seems like a lot of those people don’t remember that all BF launches are like this. Doesn’t make it ok that EA still pushes things out before they’re ready though.
this was way before he met other joe
Who here after watching the 2042 rant?
me. it's crazy how a lot of people came back to this review right after the newest one
This is pure gold. Especially after 2042 rant.
history repeats itself
"2042 was borderline hart attack 😅 but its not a bf anymore 
This was still a bf 
I still play bf  3 and 2142"
He paid 120 dollars fpr the game id be pissed if this happened..... lmao Fix this shiiit Nooow
 @lightofchicagoproductionz9012  can't just fix this shit now
 @WackoGuide  XD Lmao
 @HappyDude1  People said this wasnt a bf when it released but guess what now
And people still want a Battlefield Bad Company 3 to be a thing after EA and Dice keep shooting themselves in the foot way too many time?
Its almost like Joe dosnt know what hes talking about and only caters to milk the outrage to farm clicks.
 @shoemcflextheflex2199  DICE repeats itself. Basically every modern BF release has been horrible except for BF 1.
 @Juel92  shouldn’t have dice like learned there lesson at this point? I’ve given up on them
" @shoemcflextheflex2199  They should have, yes. When will they? Dunno.

Took me 2 BFs at release to learn the lesson to never buy at launch."
"maan i got 8 year old comment about bf4 and now shit happens again, they didnt learn anything in 8 years, ridiculous"
He literally praised bf4 in the bf2042 review. Gimmick reviews now
he was way angrier for the 2042 rant. his eyes were red! lol
It’s funny cuz EA said it’s exactly like Battlefield 4
4:04 thank me later
 @Juel92  BF1 had an equal amount of bugs
"The difference is that BF4 was still a Battlefield game.  It felt like a BF game, it played like a BF game, and it had the features of a BF game.  2042 is NOT a BF game.  Even if they manage to fix all the bugs, it still won't be a BF game.  Battlefield, as we know it, is gone forever.  EA killed it."
 @Lobanium  agree with you dude.
" @nikolasoskic9006  you should read rumours (from insider Tom Henderson) about BF2042 development, that sh is sad.

In short: og Dice developers left Dice and guys that were left (who didn’t have as much exp in bf games) had to work on it. Also EA didn’t help with constantly interfering - ala “warzone is popular, so you should turn the BF you’re working on into warzone/apex kind of thing”. Also the thing that didn’t help was lockdowns. People had to work from home and that made things more complicated."
" @nothajzl  damnn, ill take a look, but yea this games feels hella lot like a cod game with all the live menu animations and loading screens with planes and shit, feels like a black ops 2 menu somehow hah
I miss the old dice :("
 @nikolasoskic9006  funny enough they were told to replicated black ops😂
" @nothajzl  hahaha guess i was right, we'll see in a half a year to a year, the game might be good at that time"
 @HappyDude1  it's battlefriends now
 @Vandelay81  he’s reviewing 4 at launch. It got better.
 @HappyDude1  is the BF3 online still high population? Haven't played BF3 in too many years
" @LunaRose1312  not high
But still a lot of fun! 
I think about 10 servers full"
"This game was an absolute mess at launch however it was a really solid game at its core which is why it’s remembered so fondly. Same with battlefield 1, at the end of the day 5 and 2042 lost something"
"Yeah, I was just looking for his actual review of BF4. 
Just watched the Hardline review..

Battlefield 2042 is awful.. I refuse to support this mess."
 @lightofchicagoproductionz9012  he made double that money posting this video
It still to this day a masterpiece of a rant.
 @HawkknightXC88  i still rewatch it sometimes :)
Hi I'm from the future it took battlefield 6 for them to get it right and now the Saudis own EA
" @gavrock3775  hi, im in the future too XD. Bf6 looks amazing, i just dont want to pay 80 euros for it.."
Deja-vu all over again
"Thought I'd come back here and remind Joe of this masterpiece, it took almost a year to become a great FPS so lets hope 2042 can follow in its footsteps"
 wiresss  no look at this vid bf4 launch was terrible
" @grim0882  even if they did fix the bugs and their shitty servers, specialists are still a big fucking problem, theyre only there for ea to sell operator skins and get more money. The maps fucking sucks, its so damn fucking empty like why couldnt they learn from bf1 how to make a good map. Scoreboards are now gone, do I even need to explain more for this? They literally removed this feature because of special snowflakes. The UI is so fucking shit, what made bf4 and bf3 so different from cod and other fps games during that time was the ui, and they fucked it up here"
" @okiean1321  i think maps are dope, ui doesn’t bother me, i never look at scoreboards i’m just chilling i hate all of this it’s just publicity even if it’s bad"
" @grim0882  thats just your opinion, you like the game, good on you no one is going to force you to play it or not. But the general public agrees that this game is a huge disappointment considering with what they've created in bf1 and bf5 only to scrap all those features away like its nothing in order to conform to the new hero shooter trend"
 @grim0882  bro the maps are garbage
 @JohntheWeir509  naw
 @okiean1321  bf4 was considered the worst at launch and was frowned apon at launch...
" @skippy7811  and you know what? It was considered the worst battlefield launch because of technical issues. Where did i say in my comments that technical issue is a problem for this game, its the fact that this game has lost so much identity just so ea can cash grab apex legends kids. Besides that, the fact is, nowadays triple a devs seems to have this practice of releasing broken game fix later, newsflash buddy, if we dont complain about it they wont fix it."
 @okiean1321  lol specialist are pretty  good maybe your just bad
" @KaiserReb  only people that aren't battlefield fans think so, battlefield is about being a foot soldier in a war bigger than yourself, operators would have been great for hazard zone but fuck them in AOW"
 @jacobsteele1178  what kind of facade do you want to play as? It’s call a rebrand
" @KaiserReb  then don't call it battlefield if your rebranding it, that defeats the purpose of a rebrand"
" @jacobsteele1178  your living in the past. You just don’t like change. 

Go play portal"
" @KaiserReb  go back to cod and stop supporting devs when they put out an objectively bad game, it ruins games for everyone"
I can’t wait for the day for everyone to look back on this and see how cringe it was to argue over every little detail and bug
" @tencents1842  the bugs arent little thats for sure, imagine spawning outside of the map and not being able to hit any enemies evrn though your sight is on them. Honestly, if we dont complain about it they wont fix it, this is ea we're talking about."
" @jacobsteele1178  imagine thinkings that’s an insult. Go back to bf4 if you want to buy the same game 

It’s a good game, your just a dude living in the past"
" @KaiserReb  I'll just side step your hypocrisy there 🤣 

Game series are supposed to build off the last entry and innovate and keep things fresh while sticking to there roots, to make sure each game is an improvement upon the last, but when a game steers so far from tradition and guts out so many features and mechanics from past games with lack of content and effort, it's no excuse, I could excuse the operatiors if the rest of the game was worth it but it really isn't

And an example of the same situation but from a different period, COD advanced warfare and infinite warfare."
" @jacobsteele1178  They did innovate based off bf4 you just don’t like it. 

Those cod games were trash only bo3 was really good of the “futuristic” simulator"
"Too bad that the amount of destruction in that game is very limited, blowing up a wall to take out snipers and campers on bf 4 was enjoyable. They need a serious update if they want to fix that issue. I think many of the issues are easy to fix but like i predicted since the announcement of bf 2042 it will take several months or up to a year for the game to be like it should've been at launch.."
" @zippo71111  couldn't agree more, id recommend watching some vids comparing the attention to detail for 2042 vs bf 3 and bf 4 and it's crazy how little they have done, and the sound design... I hate the way 2042 sounds, everything is muffled with lots of bass, there's no pitch or high frequency sounds when you are getting shot at or anything, when something explodes, like it's crazy the world feels dead to me, BF4 may have had a way buggier launch, but it's foundation was much more solid"
" @jacobsteele1178  I've seen plenty of them, it was clear even without those videos that plenty of things had been changed. Beta doesn't hold much power anymore in terms of arguments as it's always out 1 month before the release and only the tiny issues get fixed. I've seen that happen so many times that i consider some games beta from launch and from there i wait a few months and check what has changed. It's a shame, the halo series and bf series are two of my favourite fps MP shooters out there. Halo is doing well but i will wait for campaign first, i've always done it that way even though mp is ftp."
" Lucy Ducy  battlefield 2042 has new mechanics and content.

Change bad is what your saying"
 @grim0882  yes they have no soul worst maps
 @KaiserReb  its a good game he says how delusional are u i dont mind if people like it but dont call it good fo you have any standarts the game is far from finished and its buggy u like paying 60 or more ofre an unfinish product are u seriously an ape? Look at its like 3/10 user score on every reveeing platform how is that good to you
"LOL. Some of the comments in here already showed why DICE and EA would give 2042 a green light with a completely fucked up state to launch. The IP and user base are already enough then even if they fucked up completely, some people would still think it's okay or even decent and try to defend it. And especially after watching this video again after so many years, seeing how the gaming industry has shifted so fast in such a short period. I'm beyond disappointed."
"Tbh battlefield 2042 does not have all the fundamentals that BF4 had, I have battlefield 2042 on my ps4, the game is so hollow. No building destruction physics, like wtf is this amount of weapons, BF4 had triple the amount of guns, like there's so many things I rant about in this game, but honestly this game shouldn't be released in this state, as much as I love battlefield, this game is the ending of the franchise honestly, so many die hards are pissed and refunded their money. Up till today I still BF4 and BF1 on my pc, as they are 10× more enjoyable than this trash"
 @KaiserReb  you’re angry your game sucks and you preordered like a moron so desperately try to justify your purchase to yourself by pretending the game isn’t a stinking turd
" @idrinkmilk282  yes and your a loser talking shit from a screen.

I haven’t bought the game I’ve played it though. You would have to a an idiot to buy a battlefield game within the first 3 months.

Go get some friends. Who tf Says “ turds” lame ass dude"
" @KaiserReb  lmao wow you need a hug there buddy? Who says turd? How about millions of people lmao. That’s who. You seem so angry and toxic, I get that you’re hurt over your trash dumpster fire game, but you’re getting angry over words now lol, sad af. Catch some sun."
" @KaiserReb  imagine white knighting these hack multi billion dollar companies with your spare time lol. You’re the reason these companies think they can get away with release these literal dumpster fire games year after year. You’re THAT guy, apologist kid. You’re their target audience for this trash lol.  Whether or not you wait 3 months to buy this game, it won’t change the fact that even if it wasn’t broken, the game itself is literally terrible. It’s bad battlefield. No destruction, no guns, no good maps, hardly any content overall, botched gunplay, specialists (lol), lame turdy fortnite cartoon character skins and voice lines. Lmao. Broken or not this game is garbage. 3 months won’t change the fact that it isn’t battlefield any more. Bad bones."
 @idrinkmilk282  so sad you want my attention that badly. You replied twice for some reason?
" @idrinkmilk282  I’m sorry if you think I’m reading that your buggin.
Lol imagine thinking I care about your opinion. Peace bro"
" @KaiserReb  I don't think he replied twice on purpose, youtube has this glitch where when you post sometimes it duplicates. It's happened to me before."
"I think Shamoy Williams is one of those ""fans"" Angry Joe talked about in his BF2042 review"
 @guragat2  word?
Ooofff
Here too compare 2042 and bf4 launch seems about the same.
"Here we go, AGAIN"
Who here after the news battlefield 2042 rant? Some things never change 😅
"Same here. It seems like DICE doesn't know how to do 128 players well. So glad I played MAG back on ps3, that did 256 players. No fucking excuse for DICE to only have disgusting specialists, just scrap that garbage. 

I'm going back to BF4. :D"
 @JIMvc2  at least they got the trailer right but everything else ehhhhhhh😔😖
"It's almost a tradition at this point.
""Battlefield (insert number)? Ya done fucked it up..."""
"""War. War never changes."""
 @sambridgers9543  old man snake: War has change
 @JIMvc2  idk man the specialists are kinda cool
This aged like fine wine
Is the wine good through? 🍷
Keep this is mind with bf2042.
Some things never change...
War never changes
Looking at this with the perspective of bf 2042 and how bf 4 is now the golden age of bf and bf 2042 is the new bf 4 of this time
Now we wait for the Battlefield 2042 rant now! Wonder when that will be!
Soon lol. He made one on stream like an hour ago 😂
It's out and man it's spicy same level of rage haha
"Still relevant today with 2042 and 2042 is far worse off than bf4 was. At least when bf4 was fixed, it was a quality battlefield game."
It took almost a year to make bf4 at least playable
BF4 was not fixed in a day. Do not have rose tinted goggles
 @octapusxft  I never said it was fixed in a day?
 @WomanSlayer-69  no it didn’t.
" @jimmyracecar7  It did, servers were dogshit for like a year"
2042 rant is gonna be majestic😂
It's pretty magical and full of rage haha
Can't wait to see your battlefield 2042 review ! Lol
Who’s here after Battlefield 2042 release ? Lol
Who's ready for the 2042 special
Nice profile picture :)
I'm here to compare how bad this launch was compared to Battlefield 2042. I hope they can fix it.
Did you watch the rant for 2042
"Every battlefield 
TERRIBLE launch?
Check
Fans saying the older game was better
Check
New game releases and Crown 2042 as best battlefield game?
To be seen"
"It's happening with BFV now, lmao it'll happen with 2042 too"
"Coming back to this to reminisce as just like Battlefield 4 at launch, 2042 is also presently a miserable time."
Same here let's hope 2042 can follow in BF4's footsteps
The BF2042 launch was so bad that I had to come here to check if BF4 was bad when launched. No wonder.
Not to forget the chopper whores
ohhh i cant wait for him to learn how broken battlefield 2042 will most likely be
I wonder if we'll get a reprise of this for Battlefield 2042.
"I expect something like this when 2042 comes out given how bad that game looks rn.
FIX
THIS
SHIT


N O W!"
"Lol, still by far my favorite rant ever! Battlefield 4 became my favorite game for years after they fixed it up and is still enjoyable to play to this day! By far the best Battlefield game I've ever played! As always,Thank you angry Joe!"
"Still relevant, that’s a shame!"
This one is a classic.
My reaction when I got disconnected from 2042 for the 7th time midmatch
i know this is old as fuuuuuck... but cold war did exactly this last year on pc and it lasted untill early 2021 being unplayable... fatal error constantly on game bootup. i played this on PS3 and 4 back in the days. got BF4 on PC like last year or back in 2019. i regret console gaming. these are fun times when pc gaming.
After 2042's beta I have a feeling we're about to repeat history
I really hope it won't but I have a feeling the launch of 2042 will be terrible.
Gonna have a blast revisiting this when BF2042 launches lol
Youtube was nice enough to recommend this to me right as the Beta ended
I game back after playing 2042 lol
Looking from 2021 perspective this game became witch is considered the best battlefield game ever. So maybe battlefield listened.
yo imma let you finish but..... bf4 is more fun to play than bf3 right now
Me returning to the best Angry Joe review/rant ...
If only he knew
"While relevant for the time, considering how it finally ended up being this did not age well."
"That's not the point of his reviews and that's not how you should review IMO.
You do not pay for eventually."
"One of best bf ever and full of players, salty noob"
and did you play BF4 when it was released? This video is from that time period
" @JiiÄR50  bf 4 was a big mess when it got released, but after a moment it got fixed and it was good"
" @Averageenjoyer_0  moment that took more than a year... and yes, I played from day one."
Ironic that after eight years later this game worth hundred dollars and people accepted the fact this game is diamond
Even the first campaign missions is glitched
2:11 Points the wrong way
"Battlefield 2042 is coming out soon. As much as I enjoyed this rant, let's hope that Joe will not have to make this kind of video again. The Battlefield franchise deserves better without EA's bulls**t"
He's gonna do it have you played the Beta?
"Well this didn't age well he just tore 2042 a new one haha, let's hope it can redeem itself like BF4 did"
Ahahaa syke
Joe had so many legendary rants in 2013. From the xbox one to this and then the Youtube content ID fiasco he was on a TEAR!
Just traveling back in time from an era where video games cost 70$ for the base game.
Wait till this guy plays battlefield 5.
Why am I wearing headphones
Instant Classic
It kinda funny that in his hardline video he wish he can go back to this game
It's sad to see the game is STILL in this state.
Don’t do this battlefield 2042
Just keeping this video as a reminder of why I shouldn't pre order bf2042.
Me too 😂😂😂💔
"Imagine when Battlefield 2042 comes out broken? 😂
Edit: I guess my comment has aged well, hasn’t it? 😂"
I hope not 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good Old Angry Joe Rant
"Just came back to this video, and somehow I was thinking about cyberpunk :D"
Hands down still one of the best Battlefield games in the series common second Battlefield 1 my two top favorites
"- Battlefield 4:
Metascore: 85/100.
Userscore: 7.1/10."
I can't believe this was 7 years ago
“LIBARY”
“LIBARY”
"This has to change
Well joe that was the breaking point
EA never returned the same after 2014 and alot of damage has been done ever since they chose money over their people"
This vid is a classic !!! 🤣
8:36
The problem with an Angry Joe video is you never really know how he feels when you're done watching it...........
6:24 he reminds me of trump when he gives a speech
I wish he came back to see how great this game would become
Hopefully we dont get another one of these this year 🤞🏿 🤞🏿🤞🏿
Battlefield 4 bricked my PS3 back in the day. I couldn't play disc based games for weeks. Great times.
Little did he know this would be last good battlefield game...
Too true.
"Does he have a BF5 Rant, Would be epic!"
that's ur oppinion !!
"I come back to this one, 7 years later. 

One of my favourite games of all time. An experience I’ll never forget. I loved this game 

Operation locker. L85A2. Memories."
"Crazy how this game had a utterly pathetic launch, but now is the fan favorite battlefield game."
"I'd say bf3 or bad company 2 is the favorite but still, bf4 is awesome"
"If battlefield 3 was a towel, battlefield 4 was a wet towel."
It's amazing how far this game has come
7.... years ago.... this game came out 7 years ago already.......
I feel old
"And today, battlefield 3 is finally hacker free. Hooray, can finally play this game again after 8 years."
This is exactly how I felt when I played Cyberpunk 2077 on ps4
Are we getting a review on battlefield 4 or not?
"Crazy watching this in 2020 when it seems like its the standard these days that games launch unfinished 
Looking back I remember the BF4 launch being such a scandal, but it was nothing compared to what we see these days"
Just came here to remind myself Cyberpunk2077 launch is not the worst I experienced.
Still watching bc this is hysterical
Battlefield always sucked COD is wayyyyy better
battlefield is great but had shaky launches. cod has its own set of problems.
COD is like BF Lite
"Back then this was unacceptable, now with cyberpunk it’s just an inconvenience. We have lowered our standards."
Remember when launches like this were rare and not commonplace? Fuck the game industry
2020 and EA is still at it.
Funny how this is considered one of the best battlefields lol. This game is still so good now
This is still the case in 2020 and will be in future too
"that 'bee-atch"" always gets me lmao"
Who else is watching this in 2020 realizing how right joe was
"yep, this is one of my favorite videos :D"
You think people would have learned their lesson after this 7 years ago.
 @saininj  nope. Because people don't want to admit their mistakes or faults. So the cycle continues
Watch AngryJoe lose his marbles again when EA releases another game after the whole 70-bucks Triple-A games becomes the norm. Or any other developer releasing an unfinished game to please investors that want to meet a deadline.
The sad part here is that I am playing through this game for the first time at the end of 2020 and it's still a broken mess.
 AKConnor49  Lol the swimming mission is a disaster on PC. You basically cant swim forward. Its a well known issue. Also character pop in is awful as well as load times. Before you say I should pout in on an SSD it is. Before you say get a better a computer first of of my PC more than powerful enough to play this old game and my buddy who bought the game at the same time I did is having the same exact issues. So YES the game is still a broken mess. Unless you are specifically talking about multiplayer. In that case I wouldn't know. Never play multiplayer.
 @ItsJustJoeC  i got stuck in that mission too still a great game tho just buggy
" @LunaRa22  That swimming issue was by far the worst bug I experienced. The game was a lot fun overall, I was just disappointed to see that some major bugs were never addressed. Most of the other issues I experienced ranged between a little annoying to downright comical."
6 years later I bought the game with premium for 7$
YouTube recommendations are the weirdest shit ever...
Look at DICE in 2020 ! lol
I missed the days when YouTube let you cuss indefinitely
This is when the gaming industry specially ea started going down the hill
"BF4 is just like MCC.
Both had amazing comebacks but started in the worst state of their respective franchise"
"It was thanks to this game that I officially stop purchasing games at launch, and stopped supporting EA. Saved me so much over the entire console life cycle."
the most broken game at launch i have ever played
Little did he know... It would get no better.
it actually did get better
"What are you talking about lol, I have experienced practically no major bugs in years"
"He's fucking talking about the industry, guys."
"This is the best ""U DUN FUKDIDUP"" of AJ so far... What I would give for a Rant like this again...."
"I am having worse problems with jedi fallen order. The game just crashed on startup one day, and I couldn't find a fix. EA pushed the game out the door."
Update: My weak laptop was replaced with a better gaming pc. 2042 is still terrible though.
Look at this bandwagon of comments. Pitiful.
This game ended up turning into a classic
"BF3 is a classic, BF4 is its ripoff"
 @SWATmz  It's still one of the best ripoffs
Only because there's no competition battlefield 4 is still shit
 @Mike-xw4gm  battlefield 4 is god like
" Urn Turn  BF3 was released before 4, its obvious - it didnt add anything revolutionary or even fresh to the franchise. Graphics was blurry, coop mode removed, campaign worse. Name one thing that bf4 did better than 3..."
 @SWATmz  facts
​ @SWATmz ok? It's still good
" @SWATmz  Better hit register, more weapons, more counter weapons, way less heli abuse, updated BF3 maps, better graphics."
" @matenagy9244  better hit register? What the F... Any proof perhaps? Because subjective feeling doesnt matter you know... BF3 got a shitload of weapons, so... Less Heli abuse? Littlebird is the most abusive heli in BF4 than in any Battlefield game ever. Better graphics? Ok, now I know you are just trolling"
" @SWATmz  It's not subjective feeling, they updated the netcode. Littlebird is 1 AA mine and a not very difficult AT shot and it's down, and it's vulnerable to many other vehicles. It does have better graphics because the game's 2 years newer. I'm not trolling, you are hating on the game which is just a facelifted BF3 and therefore is just better."
" @matenagy9244  I still can't see any proof for what you are saying. Maybe you can convince someone else, I am not going to argue over old videogames. Take care now 😉"
 @SWATmz  I don't need to convince you or anyone. I'm stating facts and if you don't believe them that's OK. Have a good day.
 @matenagy9244 he is just wrong so he is acting like you are speaking bs to make himself right. Him verbally saying he is done arguing makes it pretty obvious
"⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠ @matenagy9244 >better hitreg
Maybe if you're playing on nonexistent 144hz servers
>more weapons
More useless copypaste, higher ttk made slow rpm guns beyond useless
>less heli abuse
Attack heli was camping and is still camping, what they did is overpowered little bird
>improved bf3 maps
LMAOOOOOOOO. More like turned them to shit, especially caspian border by adding random wall in the middle cause why not, without thinking how that will fuck up balance
>better graphics 
Maybe only in campaign. Art direction is shit, multiplayer looks cartoonish"
The BF4 hate is so fake and forced at this point 😂
1:44 del calls Joe
I remember in this video EA had responded in the comments but now I I think either they deleted the comment or I can't find it
game is really good now. Running at 120fps on mixed low and high settings (for clarity) and 1440p with a gtx 1080. Alot of servers are still active in asia and OCE and I havent experienced a crash in forever
get it on sale with the premium edition for like $15. One of the shooters i ever played!
Might start playing it again
its great cant wait for bf6
"Hands down in 2020, is still my favorite angryjoe video"
You hear his friend? “yoooo”  lmaooo
This game is amazing now
"3:09 I just noticed the warble in his voice, he isnt just angry but once other people came into the rant he got sad.....damn"
I noticed that too lol
I just bought this game 1 day ago 10$ for the premium edition!!
Good deal I wish I still had this game.  One of my favorites.
It’s baby joe 🥺
Can’t believe you haven’t had a public freak out yet 🤣
The Gordon Ramsey of gaming
Its normal... it is Battlefield 3 with addons.
Really living up to the name Angry
I remember when my brother always played this and I always laughed a lot when joe rages lol
Wait what happened to the bf4 angry review
"Joe: “I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR BS!”
(4 years of EA BS LATER)
EA: “we’re sorry”"
This aged well
4:31 bugs jep
3:36. 120 bucks
4:31 Bugs yeap
3:16 Digital deluxe hahahah what the fuck?
"My only problem with the campaign are the stupid fucking squad members. Like holy shit, it’s like they’re equipped with BB guns"
I’m no battlefield fan but this type of bs happens on fifa Smh
"Few years later , and boom Bf V"
Battlefield 3.5
"Which rant was better? Destiny, or BF4?"
Honestly BF4 but those are my 2 favorite Angry Rants. 😂
" @saininj  I think so too, Destiny's is close though lol"
I never buy any  Battlefield game until the guinea pigs says it's finally fixed.  I guess I'm never getting BF5.
Ohh boy how much this apply to the latest news of BFV dying. We need a new rant about this!
Same!
7:25 walking to the store sound effects
"gtx 780
woah
im stuck the 730"
Can you play modern games with that? I bought a 2070 super last year  and still haven't been able to use it because being an adult sucks..
"You know what I've had enough of EA? Your FUCKING BULLSHIT




FACTS"
"it's been 7 fricking years, and they have only change little.
words cannot describe my hatred for this company"
"Year 2020.  
BF5 one year later -
FIX THIS SHIT NOW!"
This video aged like milk lmao
You need to be medicated little boy.
Back when Delrith was just a casual friend of the show.
Which timestamps?
Sam Bridgers 0:14  and 0:37
 @KizaruB  When did Del become a huge presence?
"Sam Bridgers in the last few years, they seem to have hired him. He does most of their streams and specializes in completing games, especially the ones too hard for them to do"
"👍this rant, even after all these years 😭😭😭"
"""WTF IS DIGITAL DELUXE?"" -  that line makes me laugh every time hahhaah 3:14"
great video
"Ahh yes, who could ever forget the time when DICE & EA first began to show their true nature"
"Just ea tbf. Dice would have likely wanted to test for bugs, glitches and weapon balancing but Ea were probably like ""ps4 and xbox one are here, where is bf4, release it right now"""
 @richboy900  DICE fucked up with BFV
Will you please do a reaction video to Pokémon Sword and Shield?
OOH MAY YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FIFA 2O CAREER MODE ITS WORSE THAN TRASH LIKE YOU CAN PLAY WITH BOTTLES AND BE MORE HAPPY
In 2019 this would be the least of our battlefield problems
"Guess what, almost nothing has changed. Oh yeah, yes.. we got LOOT BOXES and GAMBLING now."
PC the master race 🤣😂🤣😂 dice overrated ah been good to see them fall from grace
Who here thinks games like this is more decent than 2019’s current titles?
"It is, I'd even argue it's one of the best fps games this gen. It had a rough launch though, more so on Pc"
2:08 so funny lol
0:42 will always get me
"Is this when Joe first met Delrith. Awwww


Lol"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I am cracking up 💀 😂
This has and always will forever be Joe's best video ever.
"1:31 Thus, a meme was born."
EA is the LJN of our generation. Nuff said
Gets a bad rating because of PC problems and doesn’t usually use consoles.
That one guy.... you know that type of gamer.
It’s no fun if the game crashes on you when you get so far
Luv it
"EA

N E V E R 
P  L  A Y A B L E"
2019 and we got loot box
"""I know for sure Dice wouldn't let something so buggy come out"", funny how things changed at Dice..."
I Remember this shit too it was bad on the 360 my game always freezes or crashes on me like everyday in November and in beginning december it was still freezing I thought my game was broken and then I found out later on way my game was doing this the game was rushed and ea never let dice fix these bugs in time I was pissed of I was hooked on bf3 for a while being ready for bf4
"6 years later and EA done fucked up BFV, Battlefront I and II, Anthem. EA has infested Madden, NHL, NBA Live and FIFA with the most disgusting pay to win loot boxes with some of the shittiest drop rates. They straight up killed Titanfall, Dead Space, Need for Speed, Sim City, Medal of Honor. Literally fuck that piece of shit company. I know there are good people who work at EA and it's developers but I think they just need to go out of business. 

I'm really gonna be sad that I'm gonna have to skip out on Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order but I can't support that shit company especially after that ""surprise mechanics"" statements."
We need a rant for BfV
Sad to see that joe has to bleep the f word now get a loada this society
Can't be a libtard supporting libtard agendas and then be upset over the libtard consequences. Political correctness is just another way of making people shut the fuck up and do as they're told.
This was the final great Battlefield.
"It all started here. Wtf, EA."
You don fuc*ed  it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"l remember when YouTube had annotations and it said Angry Assault, f."
Now it does again
You’re such a “woe is me” kind of person.
I wish I could punch you in the face.
Oh boy. How innocent we were back then. Bf4 was just a tinie tiny taste of what Anthem was. Bf4's launch was good compared to the the incomplete mess that Anthem was (and still is)
Everyone time stamp what you think are the funniest moments in this video 6:24
Joe just loses his mind at random parts of his rants and just does random shit
"6 years later, it's still funny, sadly company hasn't taken a ""hint"",  this game was optimized, and is fun, premium was free for a time, but it's too little to late, I run into a hole lot of empty servers."
just wonder why didn't joe review this game hmmmmmmmmmmm
Epic hilarious reaction at 0:41 joe at his finest 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it’s funny how popular this game was. EA fucked up. and now look at battlefield 😂😂 nobody plays it
"Colt The really funny part is despite how broken and terrible this game was at launch, it has become the best if not one of the best Battlefield games in the series, and still has a higher player base than some of the most recent entires in the series."
Why play this shit while you can play Nintendo DS
King Kai @ 6:48
"2:08-2:25 should be a green screen meme, yeah"
Lmao console didnt have this problem
True
That's why xbox 360 port is my favorite.
It's 2019 and I'm still coming back to this video to watch you flip out... :D
Classic
">Game crashes
>Shows desktop
>Shows a billion programs open
>Joe wonders why it crashed
>Me: [stares at all open running programs clogging system]"
"2.2K EA employees disliked this. It must've been them, cause honestly I don't see anything inherently wrong with him venting, just seems unnecessary to actively do so. I don't get it"
Oh god here goes 😂
It's cus u played on pc
Love it when be says u done fucked it up
Pause at 2:56
half the game is in the chrome browser....
Loved this game regardless of the shit truly epic multiplayer and hour long conquest games
"the problem was that EA fucking pushes the shit right out of the asshole befote its anywhere near ready.  An incompletely , buggy mess is not worth 60 or more dollars"
"Sad to come back to this video after a couple years and with other studios like bethesda now full in the chucrch of ea (fallout 76), 2019 gonna be a worrying year for gamers."
This never happened on console the game was almost flawless with the occasional rendering... PC master race my ass lol
Nice troll
This never gets old.
I  come back every few months for 8:52
"EA: bf4 crashes all the time


Bethesda: Hold my bag and beer."
bf4 and hardline was in the psn store for 5 bucks in a bundle thats ok but i fell the people who bought it for the full price and hardline omg what the fuck is that shit not even 2.50$ worth
Its funny how people shit on bf v saying that bf 4 was perfect and nobody seems to remember this. But damm i remember too well my first bf4 crash. Bfv works perfectly since launch. Dont have any fucking dlc and its funny and looks gorgeous. Time will put everything on his place
Now it’s one of the best battlefields
Stevethekid 119 not good as bf3
I fuckin love this game
Watching this as Battlefield 5 was just launched. Ironic...
Now the game is very good but tons of hackers. LOL. Thanks Dice.
"Will he get angry with Battlefield V?  ""Stay tuned..."""
Has EA gotten any better 2018?
"one guess, no prize"
ricojes I guess not
What are some “angry” languages? 😠
if the video was made long ago why did you comment just now?
My native language (Georgian) might sound pretty angry to native English speakers
"German and Cantonese

Edit: Cantonese only"
French
 @CheukTheGreatestOfEverything  bro its Not angry im a german

2. Германский. Не злой, совсем, просто у некоторых такие низкие голоса, что кажется будто они только проклятьями 😵‍💫 разговаривают 
3. Арабский. Злой только тогда, когда зол человек 👺 
4. Китайский никак не звучит зло/агрессивно, даже когда они злятся 🤭 
Про французский или итальянский вообще молчу, не может такое изящество быть грубым. Они даже когда злятся или ругаются, всё равно звучат так, будто в театре драму играют 🤌🏻"

"If you speak German like an Italian guy who got his nutsack caught in the zipper, it does sound angry. Who would have thought.🤔"
Ich würde eher sagen:Ich habe dich sehr lieb. Verstehst du mich
Nein
You all think that way cuz of hitler and the nazi time but u guys don’t know that hitler was not German but from Austria and he spoke Austria Dutch and not German
Yippee kid: Are you sure?
"I'm from Germany, I do not think it sounds aggressive, but I will do anything to escape speaking that language. X3
Also, one word that I like is ""tschüss"". It sounds cute in my opinion. :3"
"Also I am so happy that I grew up with German as my native language, because I like learning languages, but I would not have wanted to learn that. X3"

"""Du riechst nach Scheiße"" alter ich kann nicht mehr 😂😂"
Every language can sound angry if spoken in an angry voice. Or nice if spoken nicely.
stimmt doch garnicht
Idk tho as a Russian them Germans give me ptsd with out having a trauma I cannot listen to their language or look at them without thinking of hitler and seeing them in nazi uniform idk I think I watched to much wwII movies to help me with that lol I’m sorry but that’s how I see Germans
Du riechst nach scheiße ☠️☠️☠️

"Ich bin Deutscher, aber unsere Sprache ist für mich in Ordnung"
As a german. We SOMETIMES speak very aggressive. But it‘s not a angry language.
My language doesn't sound angry but the grammar is the difficult thing

We have a secret:we're always angry!
You're making it sound so angry
Hitler speaking in a rather german angy tone: NIEN I SAID A GLASS OF JUICE NOT GAS THE JEWS
"ich liebe dich, Baby, so sehr"
"German can sound very crisp and harsh, which is sometimes perceived as angry, but this is only the case when the speaker gives orders or really is angry.
A German native speaker, when they are in a good mood, adds words to a sentence that have not a meaning of their own, but add melody and gentleness to the language and take the harshness out of it, although the sentence gets longer (e.g. schlechterdings, vielleicht, möglicherweise, glücklicherweise, leider, zweifellos, sicherlich, kaum, bestimmt, hoffentlich, vermutlich)
They are called ""Modalwörter"" and are used instinctively.
Their correct use may be the greatest challenge in learning German."
It's all games until German muslim joins (they're not bad)
As a german i can say ... Nothing in german sounds angry
German is a cold language I think... or it's just because of politics....
Nein
HELP EVEN SAYING MILK IN GERMAN SOUNDS VIOLENT💀💀💀 (i literally am partially german)
Tschüssies <3
"what i heard, "" Ich Skibbidi shots, sould stares "" and "" Dogsh naut  shmll"""
😂😂😂 hahaha
"When a german is mad then ofc it's gonna sound aggressive! Like no shit sherlocks ! But it also has to do with the way u speak it german may have a few more consonants or whatever that sh't is called but i personally don't think it's aggressive

Great game nothing but player haters
21:12 24:22 26:18 basically suicide squats:
Imagine being the doofus that said this is our most ambitious title ever created at Austin in an interview 😂. Did he leave the country after they released this masterpiece ?
12:31 It’s Vaas :D
At least they are will8nf to give back foreskins?
This may not a halloween episode but i do love watching this video in October for some good halloween vibes
The skits Are the best part of this game 😂😂
"i am a vampire, shoots him, aaaauw, that killed me ;p"
Bring back more cobra commander 🤌🏼
with the gamepass price increase we may see him again
Watching it again.😊
This game pretty much sums up xbox and gamepass in one. You get what you pay for. Quantity over quality.
Playstation is king
One of the few times that Angry Joe wishes a game was only 4 hours long.
34:43 LMFAO
"Arcane. Of all studios. What could have been. The old story of cashing out. ( Although, if I recollect, Deathloop was a terrible game. For me, it was)"
I honestly think that Arcane is probably one of the more overrated studios out there and while it is a bummer people lost jobs I don't think this studio was really that talented. Think their last two games kinda proved that.
" @JustinJTime  You are spot on. But they are not as bad , as this one."
😊😂😊
guess someone wanted the cutscenes to be like a comic book or something
❤
0:49 That is a gay vampire. 0:55 Confirmed.
'Mr. Spencer's' mumbled lines on the phone are too funny.
"To be honest, this shit should be against the law. Seriously, all this was a cash grab, nothing more, and yet they got away with it!"
Your video had over 30 ads! It was one like every 4 or 5 mins! I cant watch your videos anymore bc you have waay too many ads on them. Unsubcribed
My favorite part of this review is when Angry Joe snaps and tries to choke out the fourth wall at 26:17. 😂
I would never consider playing most of these games even if they were good but i just love hearing you complain
Angry Joe never fails to make me laugh :D
12:40
"5:04 tbf, every kinect game sucked. I blame microsoft more than Sega on that one."
Nah not every I like dance central and the other dancing games I also like Kinect adventures

"The solution is the same as ever:
- Stop playing AAA garbage
- Buy and install AA or indie game (in this case V Rising, if you want a fantastic vampire game)
- Congrats, you win"
"Prople who buy digitally,  are the nain eeason such garbage us being shat out."
What does buying games digitally have to do with games like redfall releasing? Am I misunderstanding your comment?
No they don't! Stop spreading misInfo.
"Besides, I know on the console, physical releases are still a thing.... however on PC physical releases have been dead for over a decade, so what are those players supposed to do? Quit?"
Corporate Commander Performance= Masterclass
i wonder... did the devs ever patched the 60 fps before the studio shut down?
Crash-fall ✌️
"Can’t help it, seen the intro skit 15 times already lol"
"naaaaaaaaaaa. redfall. doesnt even make my top 20 list.  maybe high 35.  end of the day its labled all badly. open world game, ummmmm and jail cell is just a room"
this game was incomplete and they gave up
"9:45 ARE YO- ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR SERIOUS?!

Did i do it right? Im amedican now?"
Little did he know that Gollum was around the corner lurking.
"Redfall: ....................

Enough said."
Absolutely fantastic work!!!
i love rewatching these
Lmao when joe was shooting Alex an he does a lag reaction haha
"Correction here since Dishonored was made by Arkane France and they never made bad games, Arkane Austin is an american travesty that make crap game!"
"You can just tell a game will be bad if you just look at these activi.... i mean ""developers""."
"""This garbage has a message for you""

Every work related email ever."
REDFALL is better than Gollum
It’s better then THE DAY BEFORE
It is better than Mind'sEYE 😅
"Ngl, I was so glad both this and Starfield ended up being bad games as it felt like karmic retribution for Micro$oft’s underhanded, gross practice of buying out multiplatform exclusives.

We saw how that worked out for them, and it was deserved"
26:22 the entire game
how is this game fun?
"This is the type of game that is written by people who don’t know how to write, but because they tick the correct boxes they are given the greenlight."
Angry Joe casually using a real Beretta as a prop! I knew he had good taste
Best game ever made
and ppl still throw money at it like jam between toes and they will never stop.  greed has won.
"It failed and the company closed, dummy."
🤣🤣🤣
And phil spencer himself revealed this game. 😂😂😂
Good they made the game so we can get a review from angry joe
In the bite back edition...you get fore skins.....
Imagine Joe sitting outside your development studio asking for his money back
"This is just a back for blood with vampires without the card system, probably the only reason the underbosses are so easy is because no one wants to play with game and evenone agreed to shorten it as much as possible."
"Back4Blood was fun on its own, it was failed because they wanted to compete with Left4Dead and people hyped it too; RedFl is complete garbage!"
26:18 Oh no. Joe has finally snapped. HEY JOE YOU WANNA PLAY A VAMPIRE GAME?!
❤
"Lol 27 crashes, curious if it was Unreal 4's ""Enable Stabilization"" setting in the physics settings, shit causes all kinds of random crashes"
What a load of bloody garbage is this game.
Never knew Vampires crave human brain. So does that mean Zombies suck blood ?
4:01 YA DONE FUCKED IT UP!
"Just revisiting this vid becaus' YT, what a shame that this game turned out like this!"
"I admit that I paid $100 for the Bite Back Edition, and I preordered.
In my defense I was quite drunk at the time."
😂
26:18 So the game designers just ruined the entire boss battle and we never gonna get to fight against the boss...
Kindergartners: Finally an Easy Game just for me!
"In the words of the great Reggie Fils-Its-a-me, ""If it's not fun, why bother?"""
40:00  Literally EVERY decision Phil Spencer makes is a disappointment to xbox. And I truly mean EVERYTHING. xbox is nothing but pure corn riddled shit. absolute waste of money unless your'e an ignorant sheep.
i hate what the internet has become

I had more fun playing this than dragon age the veil guard
"Because Dishonored 1,2 and Prey drained the life out of Arkham"
We should have stopped at death loop
"I fell asleep playing this. TBH, this game was great for my sleep schedule."
"I know this is kinda old now, and this is small, but I swear to god the theme playing at about 15:18 sound spot on similar to Higher by Avenged Sevenfold, is that theme from the game? Did Arcane rip that off? Id absolutely believe it, seeing the rest of this game."
2025 this is still hilarious
"I wanted to watch his review of this atrocity, and I couldn't remember the name of the damn game because it's so generic... had to google bethesda's worst game, and apparently that's starfield, so I had to google bethesda's vampire game, it came out with redfall, and still I had to think hard if that's really the name of the game, THAT'S HOW GENERIC REDFALL SOUNDS!"
"""Do u know what a movie is""!!? Umm.. it's a videogame, not a movie...do YOU know what a movie is Joe? I've had to skip like three of the last five of these video reviews, that I've always usually liked--but now, I'm not even big into religion or whatever, but when A literal 40 yr. Old guy is acting MORE petulant than a 14 yr. Boy, blasphemes literally a half dozen times @ just over half the video, it starts to grate on me 2 the point I can't make it through. Even if he's atheist, I just don't get the point of ""chancing"" it, for the upside of....convincing maybe teenagers that you're ""the world's toughest videogamer"" devoid of muscles? I get it's the ""routine"", but I've seen COUNTLESS videos of these, where even Alex just sits there w/that thousand-yard-stare, for 99% of Joe's ""tantrums"" & freak-outs. He might like the gaming part, but even he, OPENLY dislikes Joe's sad little rants about how hurt he is about playin 20 hours of some game, rather than some other game. I'm genuinely proud of Alex though, for not pretending to laugh. I love Other Joe, but he's FAR too kind of a friend to not @ least try to laugh, to make Joe not feel as uncomfortable"
nice yapping lil bro
charging 70$ for games like this is wild. who thought that should be the normal price?
Please switch from gfuel to huel. Gfuel is so bad for you.

"It's just their job, they ain't gamers, i bet these people barely enjoy video games to begin with... They take cover... You mean like in FEAR 1? corporate tools really, just a job."
Corporate commando's plan makes no sense.  If a game is bad it doesn't matter how much the company nickle and dime's people it will lose money.

"I'm curious if that's the original jacket or if he's replaced it over the years, LOVE the videos yall put out. Shout out the AngryJoeShow team fr fr <3"

Similar vibes to Mafia 3
"I actually liked the music, I got the game for free too so I'm not too upset Also that company only did single player games, they were kinda forced to make a co op game."
"Even with bugs fixed, the game is very shallow. I stopped playing a few missions with my buddy. Now we are playing Lies of P while we chat on game chat 😂"
"This one was sad...Arkane ""was"" amazing.
Dishonored 1/2, DeathLoop, Prey, Dark Messiah, Bioshock 2, Wolfenstein 2...All quite good."
Redfall sucked the life out of 2023.
The enemy with the grenade was acting like a Football QB. 🤣
Dishonored says Arcane Lyon. I'm replaying it and it's still fantastic. Sad that they didn't keep up the quality.
you touched REDFAIL ? you have my sympathy
1:00 0:59 0:58
if you hated this game and you are anime fans go watch Hellsing Ultimate it's a fun watch and actually shows you good vampires and actually cool scenes
Good
I understand if its the worst game for the people who payed $70 but i got it for free  and the game aint bad to me its actually fun

"Man. Us dishonored fans have been begging for a new game, and Arkane being arrogant as they are since deathloop ( such a stupid story), they decide to release this absolute garbage?? Thanks Arkane. Go back to dishonored… that’s when they were making ACTUAL good games."
I’ll never play an bethseda game
I thought this would’ve been like Left 4 Dead but it turned out to be a cringe inducing horror themed Far Cry. 3 hours was all I needed to delete it.

Telling Bruce and Gary to get the janitor so he can open the door lol
"LOL!!!!  Very good video and great hilarious truthful review.  
Well it is Sept 2024 and Redfall game on Steam is now 39.99 which is even too high a price for me considering the game is a 2023 game. From what I was told and see about Redfall, the developers did make one last update to the game, even after the game went under and can play it solo now.  Some say the game is a little better now, but until they sell it for 10 dollars or less, I am not going to get the game considering the game is dead far as no more updates will come out for it.  Redfall can be played in UEVR but some say it is not the greatest to play in that mode. 
 The graphics don't look bad, but I guess the game play is not (sucks).  Sounds like if we have nothing else to play, this game might be good just to wonder around the city etc using a VR headset and test UEVR settings.  But only if game is 10 dollars or less.

Thanks for the video."
"$100 Freaking Dollars!?, What Were They Thinking!, Were they trying to take the Action 52 method, with all that money you could have bought 5 different games for just under $20, maybe even more if the games were on sale or cheaper for that matter!"
"Wait, do they each have to buy the game at $79??"
"It sometimes depends, but they all got the game through gamepass. So it wasn't that much money."
Man i miss when Gamepass was only $15
"Why comment, folks? Youtube will take it down if somebody doesn't like it."
"The Day before stole Redfall last place awards, I was rooting for RedFall last year."

"Interesting hairstyle from the creative director of Arkane Austin. It’s like he went to get a haircut than after 10 minutes he just got up from the chair, paid, and left."
red fall is a bad ( ps3 game) its not a B+ let alone AAA
And here I thought Vampire Rain was terrible. 😞
What was xbox thinking releasing this game smh
"Damn, OJ looked creepy near the end...."
That face is gonna haunt me in my sleep...
What happened to Corporate Commander’s voice???
Probably forgot to use his voice modulator to set it up a higher pitch that's normally presented back then. But it's still a neat over the top performance nonetheless
"Aaaand Arkane Austin is shut down because of this disaster of a release.

Good fucking riddance, I'd say.

Redfall is just a fucking joke"
"I am proud to say, I worked with Ubisoft on the original far cry all the way up to far cry three special edition…. Got nothing to do with any of the modern games, thank God… and now look at the company it’s collapsing 😂😂😂😂"
8:15 HEY!! ARCANE AUSTIN!!! GIVE MY MONEY BACK!!! I See Your A$&es In There!! I See You Through The Wind…. You!!! Bruce!! Gary!! Have That Janitor Open The Door & Give My $70…😂😂
"Fuckin OJ
Love it"
"next in line, Cooooncord, get ready"
I wanna see Corporate commander again.
I have a friend who’s boycotting Tears of the kingdom cause he thinks it’s the first game that’s asking for $70. Um…
What’s happening to x box?
"Phil, someone has to be thrown to wolves........its 2024 that wolve done arcane Austin"

My friends tried to defend this p.o.s when this review came out they disagreed joe even tho all the bugs happened to us that you see on rhis review and i couldnt but laugh at them thank god we didnt pay for it but still them defending after seeing the bugs themselves showed me how arrogant some gamers can be sometimes!
32:08
Men
Amem
Who else is coming back here after Microsoft announced they were shutting down Arkane Austin?
This is the 5th time we've had to go to the fucken main menu to fucken play with our fucken friends!!!!
"3:40 How real this quote is today...  ""someone has to be thrown to the wolves"" Rip Arkane"
12:44 Who else thought that the Video was buffering the 1st time they watched this?! 😂
Harvey Smith clearly wasn't drinking water in those interviews. He looked like he wanted to commit suicide.
"You know that, when Gran Turismo 4 and GTA San Andreas came out, on Playstation 2, that those games were finished?! Amazing, right?"
12:44 this fucking killed me 😂😂😂
"This ""you done f@cked it up"" was special XD"
"Prime example of ""telling"" not ""showing"" a interesting story. They literally have the medium to show you ANYTHING as it relates to the story, but it's just characters talking about shit you dont care about. Show us something to have them tell us what happened. Writing basics man."
"Damn, that initial bit with corporate commander rings very differently now. RIP Arcane Studios."
8:15
"This game is terrible, it's so much worse because lets say you beat dishonor and then someone comes into the room and says yo these guys that made this are gonna make a vampire game. You'd probably be pretty fired up, the arkane that made dishonored would've made an amazing vampire game. But nah instead you get a terrible nothing game"
"11 months later -  ""Corporate Commander strikes! Arkane Austin, is no more!"""

"Joe: There’s never gonna be a Redfall 2

Microsoft: You’re so right!"
"7:27 “Redfall used to look like it was straight out of a postcard.” But, don’t most places on postcards look like they’re out of postcards because the postcard is a photo of that place? 
Anyhow should’ve known what it was from that line alone."
All the of the Dishonored games and Prey were masterpieces. What happend to Arkane??
Arkane Austin didn't make dishonored. They made trash like Prey. Are we surprised this game sucked. thank god they shut Austin down. I bet anyone a hundred bucks Blade is going to be amazing because its Arkane Lyon. The studio who knows how to make a good game
prey isnt trash
"Watching this a year later everything makes so much more sense. Phil Spencer never gave a damn about about Xbox, its devs or the games. It was all about just creating Netflix for games. Where’s Gears 6? The last good semi competent Xbox IP left and not a peep. Between this, Halo, and Starfield every middle management and exec should take a 50% pay cut. Phil Spencer is also the one who decided to pull the plug on overwatch PvE, about 200 people laid off not two years after being hired. All Phil Spencer does it yap 24/7 repeating whatever his PR rep tells him. We could’ve had Hell divers 2 but in the halo universe and gears but Phil Spencer couldn’t stop sucking his thumb and chasing trends like an overgrown toddler. The last time I gave Xbox money was Gears 5 and they will never get a dime after closing so many studios that have infinitely more talent than 343. Pirate every Xbox game possible and cancel your game pass. Fuck you Phil Spencer and your entourage of capitalist demons go fall down a flight of stairs."
43:48 Damn! redfall is so bad it already has 2 old hairy resale stickers on it!
🦀🦀🦀🦀REDFALL IS GONE🦀🦀🦀🦀
"Now that Microsoft shut down Arkcane Austin and others, I’m afraid that Dishonored  is no longer a thing anymore 😢"
The introduction  with “Corporate Commander” Joe was actually a prophecy!! 😮😮 R.I.P. Arkane Austin TX Studio…
Just like Saints Row (2022) another studio goes down for making a shit game.
Anyone else re-watching this after the announcement that xbox just shut down Arkane Austin?
"I doubt Arcanes A team made this game, probably the C team trying to prove themselves.. Regardless, how do you let a turd like this out? I mean didn't anyone in Arcane play it first? How do you play this and, yep put it out, we're good. WTF? Prolly should be fired over this type of shit. Or sued!"
A year later & that team is now dead.
"As if it couldn't get worse...

R.I.P Arkane :("
"Joe predicted no Redfall 2, how could he see into the future and.... oh wait, on re-watching the review the game was a dumpster fire of trash."
24:35 I'm sorry for the developers especially since this was their last game. Talent wasted on something so underwhelming.
And now the studio is gone
"And one year later, the entire studio has closed down"
I now feel bad for anyone who paid $100 for content the game’s never gonna get now.
"So it turns out, that Arkane Austin has been shut down by Microsoft after this game!"
It gets a 2/10. For the two L's.
"Redfall backwards is...Llafder. Say it a few times, you might get it."
"So what's that clip from? The ""You should be outside playing in the sunshine"" clip."
"Joe forgot about Arkane's game, Prey, which was fucking amazing. Deathloop was also great too."
8:14 bro haha
"Skyrim Dawnguard:
- Has a focus on vampires with humans (or human like entities) hunting them. 

-Introduces new locations that are both expansions on the open world and a new entire  realm to explore. 

- includes new Vampire enemy types. 

- Expands on the vampire condition the player can gain that includes a new skill tree and a new transformation 

- includes new weapons/powerups that are themed with the established lore with the vampire conflict. 

- Story is written well and allows you to play either side.

RedFall: 
- has a hoard of vampires in a seemingly empty town hunted down by a dude-with-gun 

- Story is borderline non existant. 

- vampire enemies are lacking in difficulty because of both the ai and design 

- labelled as a multiplayer game but struggles with multiple people in a server.

Have to say Skyrim, a game over a decade old  handled vampires better..."
"I got this video in my recommended, this shithole feels like it came out 2 years ago, but it was just 10 months, god , this game's been topped in the shit category so many times i thought it came out longer ago than it did, ain't no fuckin' way."
"In a sea of 30 second videos for braindead, adhd riddled individuals, Angry Joe and his motley crew of Joes continue to serve up epic forty to hour long videos that stay entertaining the whole way through. Fight the Man, rally support for the indie devs, and admire the Joes who put themselves through this trash to bring us entertainment in these relatively bleak and lonely times."
26:16 best part he strangles the camera man
Oblivion has better AI
"speaker warning too, that pistol is loud"
Nice
Nice
Death loop is 10 times Way better than this game
26:18
This game got boring ASF after the first playthrough.
Alex face the whole video 😂😂😂😂😂
"Once red fall is free, I’ll play it"
This is like a game that was made entirely with AI
Emac and mavado. Nice to see them back in the game.
I don't know who that guy in the interview is but my god does he come across as a huge douchebag. From the haircut to even his inflections.
26:18 My reaction with what they did to Batman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
Just bought that game for $10… I still don’t think I got my money’s worth.
Literal slideshow in more ways then one
Lol i remember how pissed joe was when sonic free riders came out 😂
And then Gollum came...
"They fixed the crashing, I had no problems...liked the game"
"The popularity of these crap still cutscenes is getting really irritating. This awful ""rush it out the door"" culture is killing games and my enjoyment of them. The more that time passes, I'm noticing that I'm excited less and less for game releases. I've just lost my faith in the game industry in general. Same goes for movies."
The repeat cuts to Vaas licking his lips had me rolling 😂
"You know, water guns full of holy water would be better against vampires."
Watching this had turned one of my most boring days into a blast
Bethesda.....why you so surprised  😂
well at lest its nice to see one thing has not changed. If you look you can see games out there that are bad. I mean I thought we got all the bad games out back in the 1990's
In AngryJoe & Co. We trust :)
Is it sad that I look forward to these reviews more than the actual games lately?
"I gotta say, I miss Corporate Commander's voice being muffled."
24:22😂
"The absolute balls to call Death Loop a ""masterpiece"". There have only been a handful of games that deserve the title of masterpiece. Witcher 3, Assassins Creed Black Flag, FF7 and a few others. Of course this is all subjective but I think a large percentage of gamers would agree with the games I listed. Tell me your ""review"" is actually an illegal advertisement without telling me your fake review is an illegal ad."
"I actually bought it for full price for myself, my wife, and my best friend to play. Between the lag, crashes, and other issues, we STILL to this day have not been able to play together. We eventually stopped playing altogether. I will never buy a new game at full price again."
"the NPC enemies fight base of them being bland, deft & guessing🤣🤣"
"I love the quote from arcane , ( this is our most ambitious game yet ) lmao if that’s the case then we are truly doomed."
Gotta admit i laughed at the Fart joke.
"6:48 Not mentioning ""prey""? Cmon"
26:17 best part IMO
best part is 32:28
"I can't watch the full review as the game is that bad. Sorry Joe, but it backs your opion entirely."
"Can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mom"
i feel this game could of been way better but they were celarly forced to relase it in the state it was the fucking arkane deves WANTED the xbox staff to cancle it so they could make it a damn FPS single player game like dishonroed but they were screwed that and aparetnly a lot of workes on it freaking quit this game had so many things against it and now arkane is suffering from it PS they never even wanted to make this piece of crap a freaking team shooter looting game it was sapposed to be single player but they were forced to change it
That guy in the interview is the definition of smelling your own farts
I bought this game on steam can I still get my refund maybe??? Anyone???? Honestly forgot about this game lol
You deserve this punishment
Gee I can't wait to see what the next fallout or elder scrolls is going to be like....😢
7:09
Has anyone played this recently and see if anything has been salvaged? 😅
"According to the Redfall subreddit, the game has received some improvements. However, even with those changes, it’s at best a polished turd, and they’re still waiting on the DLC that they were sold."
I wonder if Bethesda fans can forgive this failure if they bundle it with Elder Scrolls 6.
"Mhm mhm great job Microsoft 😂, this is why I’m a PlayStation gamer"
Phil apologizing us such a bad look for a gaming company. Talk about incompetent management
"Dishonored and Death Loop was from Arkane Studio in France, not from Austin.
This is what's happen when openning shitty studio oversea for money"
OJs rape face was terrifying
26:18  Tearing the 4th wall to shredds.🤬😂
I love fart is other joe at his best 👌
Imagine if someone made ride to hell 2 but for some reason make it a zombie game that would make for an amazing review😂
We have that its called Days Gone
"More like Red Flag, amirite? 🤮

Please, don't let this be the end of Arkane."
16:19 This one just says fart!
"everytime joe angry reviews a game it makes me happy at least i dont get to spend my money on a shit game
thanks joe for your service"
Ill make it clear right now...iiiiiiiiii......do not buy games that use still images for  cut scenes. I spend 0 dollar. You get nothing from me...the last game I bought with this bs was peacewalker and that is the first and last time I will ever buy a game with still image cutscenes
Almost every xbox game has fortnite graphics. Fkng lame. Goofy looking character models like Sea of Thieves.
The smile on Alex when he griefs AJ is the best
Just watched this and his saints row reboot. What does it take to get a 1/10?
I think Joe playing it with friends bumps it up a point or two.
"fome on dude, this review is fake, the game is clunky as hell, poor graficks and its AN EARLY ACCES game... Comeon, you can do this better, but now its just misinformation you give us.. Its seems kind of trend for your guys!"
Perfect example of how every game developer bought by Microsoft goes to shit.
"46:09 Joe proving that ""fart"" is still funny."
26:18 best Joe moment 😂🤣
The problem is the Xbox Series S is holding back the Xbox Series X. Also why make the game good if it's gonna go on game Pass. Death loop Is a better game than red fall
Ain’t nothing like a good angry Joe rant… its therapeutic to the soul
and we are still waiting for the two new characters they promised....
"i never paid retail, only played it because its one of the few games that are currently able to be played on crossplay.  so far my mate and i have completed twice and now moved on to other games."
"Alex: BLEGH I’m a vampire!
Angry Joe: *POP*
Alex: Oww! 🥺*dies*

Angry Joe:… Not again, all it took was one shot! DAMN IIIIIIIIT!"
Harvey Smith looks like he crawled out of a dumpster...
36:55
"I would love to be a member of the angry army, except I spend my monthly stipend on supporting indy porn games because I hate myself."
Corporate commander is sounding more and more like Gilbert Gottfried
Then starfield came out too and blew chunks as well
I like how the developers try sooo hard to sell their games
It just works
"It seems like all the other big studios got scared after Baldur's Gate 3 was finally out and had to race their games for competing at the awards. Too bad for all the gamers and the people who actually work hard on these games. Don't get me wrong, BG3 is by no means perfect but Larian still made such an effort to bring out a fully finished game (which is very seldom nowadays)."
Arcane isnt good at Multiplayer. And they were forced to from Microsoft. So Nobody Wonder whats happend here.
I hope the worst games of 2023 list is coming soon....
"I see ""Published"" by Bethesda....and I knew he'd be here...


DAAAMMN YOOOUU KOOORRRPPRRAAATTEEE!!!!!!"
Never expected that 2023 would have enough bad games to forget Redfall exists.
"Deathloop was by Arkane Lyon, not Austin."
Great review
I'm assuming it was so bad because seventy percent of the studio left after they made prey when they found out what microsoft and bethesda wanted them to make.
I hope you bring back Corporate Commanders original sounding voice. It was so much funnier when It was muffled 😂
"I hate all the apologists now crying “it isn’t de dev’s fault, they are unpaid employees, barely making living wages, they just didn’t have enough time, it’s all the publisher’s fault”

Well, remember when people were defending bungie for the predatory mix in destiny? Nothing changed once they split from Activision"
"These studios end up doing more damage to themselves and their products than if they would just wait to release after the bugs are worked out. But no, greedy f-ers just have to get some money flowing and screw the customers."
"Just like what they did to Rare, Microsoft and Xbox will Buttfuck every studio they buy out. With the first Xbox Series X Exclusive being Crossfire X we are gonna experience another decade of disappointment."
Ngl these kind of angry reviews are my favorite 😂 I love when AJ just roasts the hell out of a bad game
"Overwatch with Vampires? Speaking of which,  you might be a vampire if you are constantly worrying about that felony charge from 1826 popping up at every job application  background check."
"In a way, Redfall was even worse than Cyberpunk's launch. At least Cyberpunk was fun"
"To me what really sucks about Redfall is that the concept and art could be really cool if handled differently.
Its a shame, Bethesda done went and pulled a Blizzard/EA..."
this boss easier then the doom 3 one haha
This is almost exactly like if you took the worst bugs of Fallout 76 on launch day and Anthem's netcode on launch day and smashed them together. I'm glad you saved me seventy bucks.
Bro you ar the best I watch only you for true rew
"Please explain without regurgitating someone else's review on how it's bad , I've played it and well it's not what people say , so explain"
"Coming back to play this, god dam this game is monotonous and boring."
"But...they needed some extra devs for their crown jewel project, called Starfield! If Arkane had not helped out, Starfield would not be as good as it is...a controversial 7/10 😂"
Creating this game just for an Angry Joe review is so worth it
"Halo Infinite, Redfall, Forza Motorsport. Every single major game that comes to gamepass is a buggy, unfinished skeleton that's being sold on some bullsh*t ""10 year plan"" in a desperate bid to retain subscription numbers. That's the Legacy of modern Xbox. Quantity over quality. Truly the Netflix of gaming"
Add starflop to the list too.
psychic echoes meant they didn't have to pay character artists to make multiple models
"wow, I wonder how much they saved in not paying animators to animate"
"Wow, what a fall from grace. “Dishonored” (despite kinda wondering just who the hell I was and what I was doing at the start) and especially “Prey” (despite my love/hate relationship with its ending; but that dance club ambush blew my mind the first time) really impressed me.

Now this is what they make? Don’t you just love it when some designer is told to say it’s their most ambitious game to date only for something that’s not even half-baked to be released? This never made it out of the mixing bowl.

And what the shit are VAMPIRES doing out in broad daylight?

Sad. I simply must assume some corporate suits have their nuts in a vice these days or all their core talent left.

I’m glad the premise was so disinteresting that I never took an look at this one."
"I just recently booted up Division for the first time (in 2023), and it's mind blowing how that game, from nearly 10 years ago looks a generation ahead of this turd. And runs at 60 on Series S lol"
Man i wasnt a huge fan of dishonored but I love prey this is such a disappointment.
Bethesda is shit. So is Microsoft.
"Wow ...all games? For Us, we were  used to Commodore and Atari (showing our collective ages). Then new companies:  Sony came into the mix against Sega and Nintendo. (Sorry Sega, we all should have bought Dreamcast's). Being new to Microsoft and our first Xbox Series X console, there have been some great games. Have you been burnt by Microsoft or a Nintendo/Sony Fanboy. Not sure where the hatred against Microsoft comes from. Elaborate?"
" @I5mith  pops the red pill Communist, child grooming degenerates. That's Micro-Soft for ya."
"Well least we have Baldur's Gate 3 now. I say we just support indie studios, and stop supporting the big guys until they can prove they can fix their crap."
These behemoth studios have lost the idea of what a video game actually needs to be good. Most of them probably don't even play games.
"@gergnotsloh  the devs are probably all gamers, the problem is the clowns running these businesses aren't. They have the same type of guy that thinks gamers and Wal-Mart customer's are the same."
Have you tried the game with the new patches?
"the game is unsalvageable
its flaws are rooted deep into the design"
"You can't polish a turd, regardless of what Myth Busters will tell you."
" @gergnotsloh  thanks, what with cyberpunk 2077, fallout 76 and no man's sky ...all coming back strong, curious whether there might have been a chance for this game too."
"Arkane ...

Arx Fatalis .... Dark Messiah ...

Some of the greatest games ever.

I mean Redfall isn't just bad. It's cynical."
"I find it funny how Joe gets annoyed at Deathloop getting a 10 then he goes and does the same thing to Hogwarts Legacy, another 7/10 game at best."
"gollum took the spot, then kong, then the day before"
"As bad as Gollum is, at least it sort of had an original game play concept. Day Before isn't even a game. It was a scam from day one."
Alex trolling with c4 will never get old.😂
I liked for 32:22
"Remember when Redfall was the worst game of the year? And then it was Gollum? And then it was Kong? And then it was Walking Dead Destinies? And now it's The Day Before?... It feels like just yesterday, Arkane put out it's first dud. Oh, how the world turns."
So this is how they're gonna do it now? Game pass games are gonna be shit.
How is it not full blown fraud to charge 70 bucks for this shit?
I think the day before took the worst game of 2023.
"Idk arkane games just don’t hit for me, didn’t care for dishonored and thought prey was bioshock without the fun idk man I just don’t understand the hype"
"Sad to see bethesda also going the way they are going, ontop of EA dice fucking up since the past 3 battlefields. Cd project red is our only hope at this point guys. Praying for a next gen witcher game."
"Expect many more awful games to be made by the Participation Trophy generation. Why are the protagonists saying ""We won!?"".....No one would say that shit after harrowing traumatic events and fights. Literally made it sound like they were acknowledging themselves being in the game itself 😂  This is what happens when writers live in the Twitter bubble, they have no idea how people actually talk and interact in real life."
And to think Arkane is developing BLADE
"Rofl ""the reputation"" of Arkane Studios... It was gone with Dishonored 2 my guy, its been like 15 years muh boii..."
"Arkane was a good developer. Then they were acquired. There was nothing wrong with Dishonored 2, it was just more Dishonored 1 with a fresh coat of paint. It's still leagues better than a large portion of the games that have come out the past couple years."
Well good news actually we are getting a blade game.
"Oh man, you can really see the stress and anxiety in the devs who were being interviewed. They knew how bad it was gonna be."
"You’re washed, bro."
"They keep pushing this live service, play with friends crap and even Devs hate it.  Thats why most of that studio quit.  They didnt want to be associated with this game."
"Worst game? Yall spoke too soon cause that KING KONG gamebis ""THE WORST""💯🤣😂💯"
Such a shame to see arcane put out a game like this
ok other joe say  auyoo just funny
Redfall is hands down the best game ever created... EVER! The difficulty is on par with from software games.
"are you tryna troll? cuz if so, that is the worst attempt at trolling ive ever seen"
Ironically the bad games make for the most entertaining reviews
Funny guy… haha… YT have funny video!
Common Xbox L
40:00 Can he be more genuine? :D I completely feel like he cares. Almost.
Why is it that the only angry joe reviews I watch multiple times are for the games that are really REALLY bad??
"Bad games are bad cuz the game is bad in 10 years, not cuz launch day had bugs. Aka Cyberpunk is amazing now"
A lot of it’s issues have been patched now and it’s still a giant piece of shit. Difference between it and games like cyberpunk is that cyberpunk was actually good at its core
I heard Deathloop sucked
"deathloop was very divisive
I know nothing about the game but that tells me that the game has value even if it's just not something everyone will get"
"The Vaas Montenegro bits were hilarious!😂
""You should be outside, playing in the sunshine instead of watching this bullshit!"""
"I still don't get why a 60 framerate, which has more or less become standard at this point, was considered something to announce and market their game with."
I got this game as a free copy for with my rtx 4090 purchase and I feel I have been scammed and robbed of my money
"The benefit of experience means that I can load up a game and know if it's going to be straight trash after about 10 seconds. This game loaded into a janky character select screen. No splash, no game title, just an ugly character select screen like it was some sort of Alpha. Turned it off and deleted it. An Unholy Duo: Arkane backed by Bethesda"
"One last thing, I love how Bethesda is so hell bent on working on other games and not Elder Scrolls 6. Ya know the trailer that got announced like.. 5, 6 years ago? Maybe longer. Starfield is a joke, Redfall is a dumpster fire."
I guess the Job title of Game Tester is no longer a thing. 🤨
Clearly Game Devs need to go back to school
Why are Game Devs nowadays such dillholes? I remember in the good ol days games werent Yolo'd asf. Devs actually put thought and passion in their work. 🤨
going through Joe's videos for black friday. Saved me some money on this one.
"Coming back to this review after Gollum, King Kong, Starfield and others is such a weird sense of knowing the misery that Joe is gonna be facing going forward."
"“They didn’t even finish their own climax”

I believe the scientific term is edging."
Uh oh corporate commander!!
"The thing is, I think we just don't have as much talent in game development anymore. There isn't as much investment in creativity or innovation, just money at all cost. This is gaming now. Assimilate or find a new hobby."
"If you want to settle for the current state, go ahead, I feel sorry for you. I prefer to demand quality from the people who make this art form. and I do it without buying garbage like Redfall or COD or FIFA, without playing a battle royal just because it's free, etc etc etc"
Man... been a few years since I've seen a game review video and Corporate Commander has gotten some belly
"1:01, first 50 hours of warframe in a nutshell."
Bold of you to assume Phil Spencer isnt corporate commander too lol. Check out the leaked FTC emails
"A game so bad, Joe brought back Corporate Commander"
True evil never dies.
It was so bad XBOX shut down the studio. A year after the game came out. Just like Volition
Crashing L2p issue 🤦‍♂️ didnt have any problems
I think Kong is the worst NOW.
I knew the paper was going to say fart lololoollololo
"13:35 

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
whos the guy with that terrible lisp?
HEEE HE SAID 4 SKINS
"Redfall is proof that even fun glamorous jobs like ""video game reviewer"" involve occasional hours of shit-work.  Arkane Austin has released some of my favorite games over the years: Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah, Dishonoured, Prey.  The studio fell apart when the founder left.  Microsoft is just trying to claw back some of their investment before shutting it down.  Looking Glass, Bioware, Interplay, Black Isle, all had similar fates.  Now Arkane, Obsidian, inXile, and even mighty Bethesda are hemorrhaging talent and launching terrible games in a death spiral.  Good job Microsoft."
Joe pulled out all the throwbacks
"i hear the devs got super trolled making this but idk the full story. but yeah. it's safe to say devs do their best and care about what they make. i do understand it might be part of the ""angry reviewer"" persona to call devs lazy and stuff but i still disagree with it. would still work if it targeted the higher-ups of microsoft or arkane executives. it's not the devs who decide when the game should be released or even what the game will even be (sadly). as i understand it, especially in the AAA games industry, devs are basically just on payroll and model what they're told to model, program what they're told to program, etc. which btw is an inherent flaw to AAA projects in general, so many people are involved that on average the creative control each person has is very low. at the same time it's so expensive that big executives have to take a big interest in it, with a tendancy to play it safe and stick to a successfull formula. which ATM is open world action games. which clearly arkane staff weren't able to deliver under those conditions (mentioned in the ""tl;dr"")

it's hard to determine what was just executive decision making and how much was ""this is the best we could achieve under those conditions within that time frame"". according to what i've read it sounded like some devs wanted to salvage the work that's been done into a smaller scale single player game (towards the end of development, meaning they likely really wanted- and tried to make a good multiplayer game but began wanting something else once it became clear that wasn't feasible). 
i can imagine microsoft (or even arkane) executives forcing the game out tho despite this because they've promised to deliver a AAA multiplayer experience. knowing that if they put their employees in a grinder to have this dying, bleeding project sprint across the finish line and collapsing; to be stabilized by paramedics after the race is over, they could technically deliver. whereas changing course this late (though i suspect motivated by the fact it'd violate what was promised to microsoft let alone the public over anything else) could risk even more dev time and potentially a development hell that never ends. they'd rather get it over with and fail in a that's permissable than succeed in a way that is not.

tldr; as with most things it's often many simultaneous factors that contribute to the success and failure of a project. the acquisition of the company by microsft, the disorganization, distrurbance and staffing shortages that caused paired with an overpromised and unrealistic goal set by executives culminated in a game that was doomed to fail."
"i suspect that even under those conditions, a shorter mission based game for 30 bucks could have been quite good and possibly have had some longevity through gamepass and updates. but microsoft wanted a big AAA open world blockbuster to advertise gamepass with, that may have even been a condition or motivation behind the acquisition. so..."
"You know what I think it is? These studios are working with skeleton crews so each person has way too much on their plate, at first they think no problem but then the deadline is three months away and the game is 25% complete. Of course the publishing company would never give an extension because $$$$ so we get crap like this that only really results in reputable studios taking L's"
"How do you come off games like Deathloop, Prey, and Dishonored? What happened in that studio?"
How to make a dent in these fucked up triple A companies and their stupid cash-cows?
"Remember when everyone thought Redfall was the subtitle for Elder Scrolls VI when some rando went copyright listing spelunking way before Redfall was properly announced?

The Alik'r Desert will remember that"
Red Fail. Lol.
"A Zombie ,Vampire and werewolf game where they all act differently hmmm🤔"
"welcome to woke generation when everyone is good and special. someone allong the way of creating this game didnt have the balls to say ""hold on this game sucks. we should do something about it"" what happened to quality studios?"
"Myself and 2 other gaming buddies just finished this game with a final time of 25ish hours. Since They added the 60fps update on the series x, we had an utter blast playing this game. Sure it was simple, the gun variety soon lost appeal when we found at least one variant of it, and the first map was way too easy, the second map soon ramped up a bit nicer, and some cool missions and scenarios. It's a shame they released in such a state as it is now, it's a great time with friends. Pointless on single player though, and free on gamepass so worth a punt!"
The fact that this is from the same people that made Prey makes me so sad :/
Why does this sound like a Sierra Madre expansion quest in Fallout New Vegas?
Its like an entire game made from halloween town from secret world
It's less modern gaming and more just bad taste in games hahahaha
dishonored was dog shit idk how anyone was suprosed by this.
"""Glitches galore"".

Indeed. I got a commercialbreak."
Stop preordering... especially if it is a Microsoft owned company... they're creating a monopoly and telling use to deal with it...
9:49 He's right. Foreskins as part of a special edition sounds like a bad idea.
"Saying in Palpatines voice:

"" Yes, yes let the anger flow through you"" Joe 😂😂😂"
Hitman series does the same lazy a$$ cut scene style as well.
"""So you've specified that Redfall would be more like Far Cry than Left 4 Dead.""
""No, no, you misheard me, I said it will be a far cry from even Left 4 Dead."""
When people gonna realise Bethesda suck 😬
Little joe on the phone acting as Jennifer: No I am not gonna let you smash. That was pure GOLD
"Arcane Studios... who the hell messed you guys up? You guys had a brilliant idea and the ability to pull this off - so who or what the hell got in your way?! Who took over and ran your game straight into the ground?! Seriously this ain't you guys! Kick this guy the hell out! Hell, everyone that messed you guys up during the development of this game fire them too!

... if Todd Howard... had any involvement in this... damn that idiotic man who has his head stuffed up his ass - out of touch with reality!"
The fact that Bethesda CONTINUES to claim they're going to support Redfall SAYS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARKANE & BETHESDA 😂 fuck these piece of shit developers AND publishers.
"I don't understand why so many people praise gamepass. Do they seriously not see how it's affecting the investment they put into building these games. Y'all seriously would rather have a lot of cheap crap, just because it's cheap, than a couple amazing games a year??? I've left Xbox, I ain't going back. They can keep their cheap crappy games. Even starfeild is barley mediocre"
Same can be said for Sony.
hehe PC masterrace
And its only in the last Week we have gotten any patch or news about reshuffling due to the massive Failure of this game. 10/27/23
Coming back to this review months later and seeing the tagline: 'Worst game of 2023?' is pretty funny. None of us predicted just how bad LotR Gollum and the Rise of Kong games would be. For me 2023 has been the year of some incredible games and some absolute dogshit games.
Little did they know...
"Man, remember when we thought this would be the worst game of the year?"
"Thank you, Joe! You reminded me to cancel Adobe Pro today!"
Damn I just installed it too. It looks better then it really I guess.
"You know the telephone conversation between Cobra Commander and his assailant sounds a lot like the Dead Kennedys and the song ""kinky sex makes the world go around""😅😅"
That's it!! This Christmas I'm just going to re unbox my old systems and games..
I saw the gameplay trailer before it came out. I knew it would suck
"""Worst game of 2023!?""
How the turn tables"
I love these broken fail games and we really need those to teach the dumb gullible gamers to stop buying the cat in the bag at release date ... no better way to teach dumb kids how to become a well informed consumer and the price is also ok ... its good education and we have to reward the teachers.
The intro was golden 😂👌🏾
Good thing I don't care about vampire games unless I get to be the vampire or I can romance & fuck a vampire. 😂
"“Is this closed for you OJ?” 
“Yeah” 
“Ok. Yeah so my game doesn’t load doors” 
🤣🤣"
"""Xbox most powerful console "" can't even run its own exclusives at 60 fps e.g Redfall and Starfield 😂"
I'm done with Microsoft. Never buying another Xbox. Time to get a ps5 shirt. Lmao
"""Xbox most powerful console "" can't even run its own exclusives at 60 fps e.g Redfall and Starfield 😂"
WOTY 2023
We have yet another new contender for this title.
"At least the developers of Gollum got fired, the Redfall devs got a pat on the shoulder & told ""it's ok buddy"" F*CK THESE DEVS RIGHT OUTTA THE INDUSTRY JUST LIKE DAEDELIC!"
"""Redfall, Gollum & King Kong walk into a bar...."""
"""So what,we're some sort of Suicide squad?”"
"""... and started making fun about Forespoken."""
"the same ""team"" could be a branch within a company. not the actual individuals."
Shit zoomers prioritizing wokism. And they wonder why its trash. Its because they are as human beings.
"BUUUUT...
At least...


Nothing Blue right?"
"They told you there were Cutscenes....


Cut Scenes,"
Is it bad i actuaky enjyed playing it through with my mrs? Lol. I think when a big release goes straight onto gamepads tho the dev isnt confident of their game
36:02 3rd party account shouldn't be the norm
Please make an angry review of Kerbal Space Program 2
"Published by Bethesda, under the Microsoft Umbrella, and people actually expected Starfield to be any better? lol!"
"""Xbox most powerful console "" can't even run its own exclusives at 60 fps e.g Redfall and Starfield 😂"
That’s Bethesda/Todd Howard fans for you. They don’t give a crap about quality.
Starfield was made for true Bethesda fans only.
​ @BungieStudios cause they've built up a tolerance
The Umbrella Corps of the 2020s
Starfield is the worst fucking game bethesda has ever made LOL @BungieStudios 
"​@davidsobrito1398  Yeah, I gave into the Bethesda hype like a dumbass and pre ordered it. Never played it because i heard how meh it was at launch so now it just looks me in my eyes from my steam library."
Bethesda? More like Badhesda.
starfield was leagues better than this it just broke every minute
"Funny thing bringing up Sonic Free Riders, I wonder what Joe would think of it now that someone utterly gutted the Kinect support for it and made a fully controller-playable mod for it."
I'm genuinely surprised the $100 dollar version comes with FOURSKINS😅
The vampire intro was hilarious lol
Gollum was released the next day....
He really did tempt fate with that title :D
"Classic! No offense to those who prefer other content, but for me... Videos like this are why I subscribe!"
"I legit am glad I never bought this hunk of shit. I literally do not even know what the hell people are talking about when they say their game is ""AAA"" or some shit. Nobody knows what that means. They just tagged it on there to satisfy their ego as if they are selling batteries."
This was before Gollum stole the worst game crown
You mean Kong
 @EchoX860  ouch…forgot that one
3 minutes in and ... yep I forgot to cancel my subscription
The Xbox effect.
28:54
I hopped on this game and legit hopped right off of it and I was hyped for its arrival such a major let down its not even funny
"How about a final verdict of 0/10, or worse a -10/10?"
27:04 what's up with that gun? It literally looks like a turd! 😂
60 FPS - Performance mode - What is this world coming to?
"""Xbox most powerful console "" can't even run its own exclusives at 60 fps e.g Redfall and Starfield 😂"
You would think cooking the hardware sold them more units - Apparently it sells only more problems ;) @SolarErazer 
I felt “Dishonored” by this game being released
There 500 fucking problems look around
Oh yes let the FBombs drop 😁
If I was Ubisoft I would sue Arcane for mentioning Farcry in the same sentence as this crap. Not even close.
"The only thing this game has managed to make me even LAUGH at was the fact that the water texture and model zone was skewed out of the sinks. Me and my friends have made the joke of Square Water about it.
This game is pathetic. And it’s sad, it didn’t have to be if they went in a much more better direction and with more time. I usually love Arkane games. The idea of slaying vampires with guns in an open world could have been a fun idea."
Dozens of people gave THIS game 5 stars on Google reviews.........
They got money so...
People or bots?
"I played deathloop for about 2 hours when it released,never touched it since or remember anything about it."
It was going to be average anyway but looks like it wasn't play tested and was rushed out the door. Actually does feel like a scam the way the game was hyped up. The studio name is now tarnished with this crap when it may be the publisher's fault.
They just updated it’s getting better
Other Joe's acting chops have really peaked on this one.
I already got circumcised don't need the extra foreskin in the $100 edition.
How does joe have that much skin on his forehead?
What sound is he using in 1:52
I loved deathloop.
"well shit :P i got this game for free with my asus rog 4090 6 months or so ago still havent played it ( cough cough as of the god dam cost of the 4090 my pc isnt finished yet) lmfao but none the less this is disappointing, i was looking forward to trying it but shit good thing it was free i guess lol"
Adored the use of the Act Man clip in this. Could not stop laughing through this whole video.
"When he said ""ride to hell"", ""mindjack"", and ""Sonic free riders"", I knew he was SERIOUS. These are the best bad game reviews ever made. 😂"
Worst game of 2023 is Starfail - by a mile.
By a mile the most disappointing game of 2023 is payday 3
This fell bad
The hardest boss fight ever!
9:50 “foreskins”….huh huh
"Its just sad because you know its Greed. This is what happens to some studios that haven't made games that are like this.

For every Arkhan game Bethesda has said didnt meet sales expectations. Meaning that they sell enough to pay the studio and make some profit which works for them to keep making their type of games. But of course Execs fear making some money"
Who many F**k word did he used in this video ?
why do you care
Why would anyone watch this crap with sponsors and 10 thousand ads. Just cant do it
I love when games are terrible. It's free entertainment versus spending time and money playing trash. And I feel no sympathy for anyone who doesn't do any research before investing their money into a game.
"""all natural disasters and cataclysms are gods work ""~ some guy in the bible . so we ask ourselves why did yhwh do this ? why does he hate black women this much? the newest wolfenstein , redfall and forespoken . also disney did double speak on little mermaid live action success / failure . maybe its the consumers simply not taking to the narrative or maybe its the writers and developers slacking off on projects they dont want to do. yhwh claims he commands all humans wills so e is still to blame as per jewish mythology"
What’s up with Microsoft screwing up with these game developers they did this during the Kinect days and now it’s happening again
"""Xbox most powerful console "" can't even run its own exclusives at 60 fps e.g Redfall and Starfield 😂"
"Joe thought Redfall would be the worst game of 2023. 
Then Gollum was like, ""Hold my beer."""
"Worst game?  You truly done gone and bonked your head.  Gotta' get those clicks, though..."
naw it’s pretty fuckin bad
"Dude, fuckin Adam Sadler as Dracula from Hotel Transylvania is more threatening than any of these monsters in this whole game!!"
"Heck, Leslie Nielsen from Dracula: Dead and Loving it is more frightening than these guys."
The worst game of the year list vid is gonna be lit this year XD
"should have been expected, dishonored was trash too."
No it wasn't
Maybe developers are striving to get top views on bad game review YouTube videos
Its Free on gamepass now... don't ask me how i know
"This is so satisfying to watch since I didn't buy this garbage game lol ANYTIME Developers and promoters overuse the PAST success of a game studio as an advertising campeign, that should be an instant red flag. ALSO: If gamers used their brains more and tempered their excitement when new games release, perhaps somewhere BEFORE throwing money at undeserving studios, they would actually RESEARCH the game they intend to buy. There will ALWAYS be the gamers who lack common sense and buy the game, OR youtubers who lack imagination and let trends dictate their content, so let them make the dumb purchases, and then learn from them what games are actually worth the investment. A game studios past success does not automatically make them worthy of our money or time, so make them earn your respect with each new release, dont EVER take their word for it. Just a piece of advice that has saved me hundreds if not thousand of dollars.

That being said: I understand why Joe bought the game, as his channel is a game review channel, and in no way does my comment on lack of imagination apply to him or any of the other guys on his channel. I find this channel very entertaining, and appreciate the thought and effort put into each review. Its refreshing to see gamers who like myself still have a passion for gaming. Well done  Angry Joe!"
:face-blue-smiling::face-blue-smiling::face-blue-smiling: score should be 0/10
"Worst game?  Should try Dead Matter lol
No really don't."
This one was good
"9:45 
🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀"
16:03 I fucking lost it 🤣
"Yikes, glad to see gamer fighting back against these greedy business deals, £59.99 (GBP) for a game as broken, as barebones as this is just horrible, and £83.99 (GBP) for the ""Bite back Edition"" is so fucking scummy i swear for ""Skins that will release in the future""....you can't make this shit up. Starfield is a game i paid £85.99 for, got early acess and i absolutely love it, got the constellation skins, pre order skins, it just all works right out of the box, that game is absolutely worth my money, i got what i wanted, Bethesda rpg in space, and well, an actual video game with lots to do and content....but Redfall, what a disaster, wow."
Hell with all the shit games they make they should use the money to get people off the streets feed homeless but instead they just throw it in the toilet and flush it down
Thank God i don't pay for xbox game pass i knew back when it came out it would kill creativity and everyone was like nah its good you get free games and i told them no you pay a Netflix subscription for games and they would look at me funny or start talking shit Microsoft has all these studios and they make mediocre after mediocre the new starfield fucking sucks this fucking sucks 😞 i wish my hobbies weren't ruined by cunts acting like they love games the only good games are indie and if i wanted to play 2d sprite games i would get a fucking original Nintendo entertainment system games dont challenge anymore or try to make you try new things its all streamlined nothing new we use Cod controls for every game thats a fps we use it for third person shooters as well or its slow walking to a destination to tell a story if you wanted a movie go to the cinema and if you wanted a good story with good gameplay then stop dumbing it down try something new but everything is cod controls and everything is 30 minute cutscenes to an hour thats only good for the first play through every metal gear game i play i end up skipping the cutscenes just to get to the meat of the game which is gameplay
Theres a lot of worse games this year.
Oh hell no
"This Piece Of Shit Is Nothing Like Far Cry!
Far Cry Is Actually Good
Give Ubisoft Shit All You Want But Least At We All Agree They Give A Shit About Making A Decent Product For Release"
"Joe I’ve beeb watching your videos for years, thank you for all the effort and time you put into these game reviews, It helps as a consumer and I get to laugh my ass off watching 😂 thanks man"
"I mean I've always thought Bethesda made shit games. I mean, look at everyone's darling New Vegas. The game is only fun because it's like one big glitch. Other than that, the story is boring, the graphics were way behind other titles of the time, the map is empty space with hardly anything going on with scorpions thrown in here and there as a poor attempt to break up the monotony. I'm glad everyone else is finally realizing that all their games are half finished"
0:51
Love the Vas thrown in there 😂
"Where’s the open world concept, oh there it is. A completely empty map"
guess you could say its a concept haha
Don’t worry arcane said this game will be played 10 years from now but I’m sure they meant it will be ready to be played in 10 years. lol why would those morons quote that wtf.
9:51 thanks joe
and then came gollum haha
Is this worse than golum? 😆
"No. Well maybe. It depends on which one has more bugs, glitches, and crashes. At least in this game you can actually try to kill your enemies. In Gollum you can't even do that except for maybe like twice by choking them out. And the final 'boss' in Gollum is defeated off screen. I wish I was joking with that previous sentence. The final boss in Gollum, you don't even get to physically see him die. Just some shadows of Gollum choking him out.

Call me crazy, but I would play Redfall 100x over before I even touch the box art of the Gollum game with my bare hand."
why are games getting worse as time goes on
Its difficultly is for ign
Vampire Masquerade Bloodhunt is a waaay better game than this. its also free btw
"45:08 “I’ll give you the fucking 2 after you give me the stability patch!”
Joe says this as if he didn’t have the patch yet, meaning this was essentially a shadow 1/10, the first one in the 5 years since the MMPR Mega Battle review. Holy fuck."
"This game screwed me twice. Not only was it a waste of an hour or two of my life, it also made my achievement score end in a 2 :("
The Music is so Generic you could release the whole thing in a video and people would think it’s AI generated or from a random guy in SoundCloud
47:00 what’s the title of the music that plays during the Patron list at the end of the video?  The music that sounds like an epic March.
ESG ruined everything with diversity hires
0:51 i'm a vampire
💥🔫
I am truly flabbergasted as to how is this was even allowed to be released at this state and also i love Phil Spencer coming out after everyone wasted their money pretending that he is sorry like HOMIE you knew the game was dogshite and was 30 fps.
"shouting and encouraging people to play indie titles is very awesome cause indie developers have standards and care about their product while huge companies don't give a flying F.Gamers need to stop supporting and encouraging this behaviour,stop preordering and have some fcking standards for christ sake."
Austin doesn't need Bethesda to make it look bad.
Harvey Smith was lead designer in Deus Ex (original) how far has he fallen... :_Palm:
The corporate commander part was the best yet! Just awesome!😂🤘👍 more please.
35:09 this had me rolling
"Finally, a real meaning of ""Angry Review"" 🔥"
"Unless one reviews games for a living, if you bought it, you don't deserve sympathy. At this point in gaming history, anyone who complains about a game that's bad deserves to get laughed at. If you bought it, you're part of the problem. To all who contribute to this bad culture then whine when it happens over and over: grow up."
Bugthesda
"They knew they were being put on game pass, so they didn't put extra effort in. Would you?"
sorry for you guys playing that
I didnt pay for this and I want my money back
Seeing that schmuck harvey straight up lying annoys the hell out of me!!! Please someone bat this idiot down!!
Gollum: hold my beer 🤣
For the record this is NOT easy what so ever
"From what I read, it's inconsistent. But I'm not sure myself because I only read about it. Because I'm not a corporate simp such as people like you."
I'm a vampire!  OW! LOL!🤣
Cripple A production haha
"Not sure sure if that's original, commonly used, or if he used it in the video, but that's a good term."
I never found the problems everyone else found with this game.
Was looking forward to a you do e fucked it up intro. 😞
holy overacting
Play V Rising instead!
Is this not confirmation that you should set your console on fire and throw it out the window?
this is the part where you say bethosoda you have failed this city lol
OJ may be the breaker of games but he didn't have to do much for this one.
Worse than Gollum? 🤔
no! 😂😂😂
Lol still Simping for AOC? 😂
Why did you think in your peanut brain its going to be a good game?
"oh geez... he invoked Ride to Hell AND Mindjack....

I'm already going to go hide in a bunker."
Xbox literally can't buy a good game... sad
"Blizzard HQ saw this video title and said;

""NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR ME!"""
This game was trash. All the friends I was living with tried to tell me it was good and I was wrong. I never laughed so hard in my life 🤣 people well look and turd and call it gold now a days and it's sad......
Deathloop masterpiece?
I remember watching the announcement trailer for this game and getting super hyped. So disappointed that it's joined a long list of fast tracked games that are reliant on post game patches and fixes to actually make them playable.
i remembered when a friend showed me ur vid review about chainsaw lolipop. 11 years ago.. glad i came back to the same Joe
Now id like to say the cutscene being still could have been a stylized choice like infamous 1 and 2 do it and it looks good.... redfall on the other hand... looks pretty bad....
Alex looked miserable playing this game 😂😂
"It's a damn shame, cus on paper and looking from afar this seemed like a game that could've been amazing, in concept at least."
Game is still going strong at 70/100 dollars!
Worst game? Did this come out before Gollum?
yes
" @destinyshittiny1168  figured. I don't think anything will beat Gollum. As far as I know, there aren't any bugs. It's just bad."
 @benjaminaswad6486  100% worst game in gaming history 🤣🤣🤣
"At least the music is better then battlefield 2042. 😂 who knows you could almost say the gun play is better too. Theres more then one useable gun in this game what a concept! 

Not defending this game in any sense or means, just rubbing in how bad 2042 was/is."
The game was only easy because they played in a group. If you’re by yourself it’s a nightmare. They throw a half a dozen vamps and more at once at you. And I could not beat the hollow man even on easy because he can hit you with attacks that take almost all your health no matter how fast you are. And he can hit no matter where you are. And the blood bags explode and hit even though your a mile away from them and he has unlimited minions that don’t give you room to breathe. I would like to smack the people who made this game for putting us through this abuse. Not to mention the health your character has. As with most games. Is a joke. You barely get nicked and your out faster than you can heal yourself.
"Ew, you played it? Why are there so many simps for these companies?"
Dead space is a prime example of how to do collectibles….. And that game came out 15 years ago.
00:50 LOLOLOL!!!!
"I can't even get angry about this, the fact that this was Arkane, and the fact that they've basically lost all of their good people at this point just makes me sad"
"Red fall is better than Devil, May cry remake😂"
When it's got cheap cutscenes you know they knew the game was crap halfway into dev and decided to cut back on everything lol. Cutscenes first thing to go.
"CD PojectRed with it's nonsens, kind slut of some hardware companies"
Why is Joe's bathroom so dark?
You mean we could’ve gotten a Jedi Survivor review if not for this trash
Holes in a soap bar huh
"The first sketch is pure gold, I almost died laughing."
Honestly thought deathloop was trash
“Why is everything so easy” and I die 10 times within the first hour
“For a price” he sounding like the sellers from resident evil
Bro I thought the game was okay because I kept dying
Reality checks are fr
I feel very disrespected you gained a sub
Equivalent to back 4 blood but that shit was a disappointment
This is Bethesda right ?
Yeah its published by Bethesda but made by Arkane.
2 is 2 much.
Redfall 76)))))?)
"43:20 Oh... You're late to the party Joe. Several years too late to jump to this conclusion.
Standards have dropped quite a bit, and you definitely supported a lot of these in the early days.
You reap what you sow.

Project Zomboid is the only zombie game that will ever be needed once they implement great non-zombie human NPCs."
"His job is to review games, dingus."
" @510tuber  He isn't employed by anyone to do the reviews, which means he is free to pick what he wants to review.
Regardless, my point still stands true. You failed to invalidate anything. Petty trolling there. I've seen better."
What happened to Corporate Commander's voice? It barely sounds any different from Joe's voice now.
20:00 I'm dead xD
Totally agree with everything said here
"I was expecting a small town like ""Salem's Lot"" with scary vampires and being like ""the lost boys"" Frog brothers as vampire hunters"
13:15- MonkeyJoe not understand tech. Movie is still image. But lots.
I want to see a crossover between Joe and James Rolfe(AVGN)
12:31 You should be outside playing in the sunshine instead of watching this bullshit
"God, I want that shirt."
"I installed this game from Game Pass and then it failed to launch.
I guess I was lucky."
Imagine paying for gamepass and thinking you're lucky.
played this game on game pass glad i didn't buy it
So this is the game they were playing in Idiocracy
"To be very blunt: 
As bad as this game is. If you're an adult who cannot afford to save $70 for something you might enjoy, you're a failure.
I'm tired of ""people"" saying ""Wah! This game sucks! Should be free!"". Just admit it, you're a cheap cunt. 
Just like anyone who uses ""gamepass"" is a fucking cheap cunt. So what, you spent $70 on something that sucked. 
Big deal. Accept the loss and move on. If you couldn't afford to lose $70, you shouldn't have bought it in the first place."
You know it’s going to be a good review then we see the Corporate Commander. 😹
"Theres ZERO reason to buy a ""next gen""  console.... show me a game that i cant play on xbox one thats actually worth me spending $600 on a new console 😂😂"
i agree 100%..there are no games on the newer consoles that could not be played on xbox one
AngryJoe needs to actively search for bad games to review. His bad game reviews are hilarious!
He kind of does that at the end of the year for his yearly Worst Games lists.
27 CRASHES?!?!?!?!?
Bro wasting lots of time
"Games like these are the sole reason why I only ever had one xbox in my entire life, the xbox one s, and its shelved in my attic picking up dust, the fckin exclusives just suck"
I actually like redfall
"I mean, there're are people who like Trump or Biden, so not surprising people who like redfall exist."
how did it get a 2 out of 10 though lol. this ass of an ass game gets -5 lol
"2023 and these are the graphics coming out of triple A studios. That's crazy as hell dude lol. There's games from 2011 that look multitudes better. Not even marginally, but significantly better. I don't know what it is about the last 6 years of gaming but the color palettes and visuals coming out of these games today are at best- extremely mediocre, and at worst- downright offensive to look at."
Ill like to see him review the new updates for 2042
Of.course the game cover art is trash also
I bet vampires killed the developers but none of them knew that still frame cutscenes would not be okay.
"44:10 a fucking two 
Are you shitting me?
this game should be in the fucking 0"
"Yeah, if you're warning people not to buy a game then how is it anything except the lowest score. Some people don't understand how to rate stuff."
"​ @510tuber  Well this is a open world game without the open world in it 
Poor story plot
Poor cutscene 
Poor Gunplay
Little amount of enemies 
Boss Battle is shit 
Price is unreasonable 
Everything is shit in this game with no backstory of the character we choose to play 
So don't go judging how I rated this shitty ass game 
You are judging way too fast"
 @510tuber  Unless you are a member of the arkane studio
They need to take cut scenes out of games in general. When games started coming out with movie scripts for video games thats when single player games really started to blow.
46:00 🤣🤣 THAT SCREAM!
"I think it's ridiculous watching the higher ups in these gaming companies give interviews, being questioned by clueless members of the media, when it ultimately seems like none of the people talking over the microphone are real fans of gaming.  Does anyone else get that impression? All of it seems so heavily scripted and coached ahead of time, there's no passion in their responses whatsoever (in my opinion)."
"Hi all, i feel for the people who bought this fucket.  up game, really, an look who made it. This is why  I buy older games, the new games, well, they suck to be honest with you. Happy gaming 😀"
"Games will continue to get worse due to the increase of cheaters in games and anti cheat software not being able to do anything to stop them... Games that are being made in todays age are those same people who swore to us they would destroy the video game industry, Well its here."
How many diversity and inclusion hires do they have?
JOSEFINA YOU CLOWN
You know a game is gonna be bad when even the dev team doesn't sound excited about it
Hey! Angry Joe! Wanna play other vampire game?! Lol
i cant wait to see how the next worse game of the year is going to top this.
Terrible graphics to boot. What a shit show.
He is voice of community.
A game no one asked for that a studio was forced to make.
"Someone on Gamefly who gave it a 9 wrote this review. It looks like he's been mindjacked.

It's on xbox game pass and windows first you follow the boat with water floating in the air and colloct weapons and kill bad guys.i played with the girls abilitys are cool."
Gollum entered the chat
"Wow, I am mad and I dont even own this garbage. Who the fuck writes an in-game note/message and ends it with ""...""? A lazy ass"
Yes
And then Gollum came out
"""AI that is sight and hearing based"" What the hell does that even mean?"
Well... it lost the raspberry quickly.
0:05 seeing the face of a man yet to play Gollum..... Beautiful.
The best thing of this game is u can be a furry😂
I love how u have worn the same outfit for 14 years when u do the reviews. Who’s idea was that.
I knew this game was gonna be at most mid when they were talking about it. It's better to be a vampire than killing them en masse.
"Jesus Christ why do people do vampire wrong!! We haven’t had good vampire game for long time! 

  Not only that left 4 dead had good bosses! Fuck end of second game had DLC that was respectful… 

      Fuck this game"
Redfall sounds like a a game about communism.
BRUH THE UV LIGHT GUNS ARE JUST SHITTY JOJO BATTLE TENDENCY WEAPON
But aren't you glad that most of the money and time went into character design and dialogue? Because it sure didn't go to the gameplay developers. That's what makes a game good now.
Dude Phil needs to go. All he does is bullshit everyone every single year.
"To be fair Arkane Austin only co-developed the first Dishonored and Prey. So if you really want to stretch it, this is their 3rd game (with most people who worked on those already gone/working on something else"
this is like a steven seagal movie
"The lack of mention about the father is likely due to Japanese culture and society rather than hatred of fathers or men. Fathers tend to have very little to do with their children in Japan (it's not necessarily their choice. A lot of it has to do with how many hours they are expected to work, and how after work they are expected to go out with colleagues or their boss, rather than go home to their families). Japanese men are at the bottom of the list compared to other countries when it comes to how much they contribute with child rearing and jobs in the home. It's not surprising that people from that background wouldn't consider including the father as important at all to include in this game (even more so given the character is female, as some believe men should have a bit more to do with their sons)"
"19:48 Talk about fucking pot calling the fucking kettle ""Fuck""."
The skits thoe Oooooo!!!! He said fuck fuck fuck!!!!😂😂😂😂
We need to change the terms of service. OJ is too funny bro.
I like how the main character has a gaming cape lol
If the main character didnt talk this game would be at least of 7
the boss voice acting is pretty good yeah
"Every now and then I watch this review just for comedic relief, so well done, some of your best work. That intro with OJ playing the writer... so good."
"I mean, she was abandoned by her parents raised on the streets surrounded by shit people. So how would she turn out?"
"""How can you go from Final Fantasy to this?""
... have you PLAYED Final Fantasy XVI? Have you PLAYED Final Fantasy XIV anytime recently? Even the latter is losing players at this point (though it's still Squeenix's last remaining cash cow for now)."
"I just finished the game. And it started good, story and gameplay, but as you go further.. nothing happened. Toooooo much explore ( mostly the distance). Nothing meaningful.  Towards the end, I skipped all purple quests and just went for the main story.  The end part is tooo roughly.. same same same.. like give me two  or three whole cutscenes already and be done with it.  Not a game that I would recommend:)"
Alex kills the rapid fire reviews Joe let them man do more. It makes the actual reviews you all come together on so much more worth it. Like you know either they FUUUUUCKKKED IT UP Or Dem bois did GOOOOOD
Other joe has telent in acting. Amazing
FFxvi blows this out the water and FFXVI wasn’t that good
I love the subtle shade at 1:56
bad vid the game better than your vid
"Of course she doesn't inquire about her dad she's black, lol"
I think a 4/10 is still too high.
Yeah seriously though I played the game and I was like okay it's a pretty good game the combat is kind of sluggish but it's okay and then she gets arrested and they're talking about her being a demon and the first thing she says I'm from Hell's kitchen and I was like and you're going to jail or gonna be sacrificed
Homer the cat was her father.
"They said ""Gotta find Homer first"" when they were supposed to start making the game"
"“wOKe”

-some idiot probably"
We all know it’s woke bro 😭😂
DEI consultant firm made seven figures for this piece of garbage.
🤡
"""Any game with non-white main character is woke"""
😒
 @gtas321 pretty much what he is saying yes
"She’s not nice to kids, by the way. 

If you pay attention, she’s nice to the BLACK child. She’s also nicer to the black characters. Shes a racist."
"One word describes this game ""WOKE"" - end of review - 2/10"
🤡
Grand theft auto 6 will be $100
Compare GTA V with other triple A games at the same price and you will realize that GTA VI is worth more than $100.
it's cool cause that's how modern women and girls are
"Want a good isakai game, try primal on ps2, decades old and still better than this"
"Holy shit, that’s what I thought of when I heard about this game when it was announced. I just forgot the name I remember playing a really awesome isakai game a long time ago but couldn’t remember the name of it. Thanks"
"yeah, the actors are amazing
and the writing is trash"
"It's that stupid marvel humor  destroying every scene in this game. And it was the first time in my life, I thought to myself, that this is too much cussing. Crazy"
This game is actually good.  I didn't expect to like it this much.
Nice angles.
When redditors make a game
Didn't know this game even existed 😅
good thing i got it @ $30 sale
"Other Joe repeated saying ""bang bang bang"" still makes me laugh hysterically!"
"I recently downloaded this game because it was free and since I didn't really get too much into the discourse about it when it originally released. Went in with a clear mind and unbiased viewpoint. This shit sucked. It was so dry, bland, boring, etc. My girlfriend watched me play a bit and was even saying that Frey is unlikeable. I can forgive games for having predictable story beats if they are actually fun to play. But this was a legit waste of time that I could not finish. I'm one of those people who explores every ounce of an open world just in case I find cool stuff, and this world was too uninteresting for me to even do that. I did not care if I missed anything. But according to this review, I missed nothing. Very piss poor effort for a modern single player game."
Rachel Zegler would be perfect for the live action adaptation!
definitely 😂
The graohics look like they made this inside of Riven or Myst
"OJs ""Hewwo!"" makes me laugh everytime holy hell 😂"
she is the Karen to rule them all
"its was ""free"" on plus and i still didnt bother grabbing it. played the demo and that was enough for me. SE could have been working on a remake of an earlier FF instead of wasting time and an assload of money on this pos."
NewYork was more interesting than the Athia.
This is the biggest example why you dont do DEI in gaming. Somewhere out there is a giant mound of physical forspoken copies in a trash heap.
"Forwoken,. Nuff said Bub."
Right now 31 people are playing Forspoken
"Pros: The main character looks hot (but is unlikable) and there are cats in the game.
Cons: Everything else."
"Oj, gets to eat something every video, 😂😂😂"
Can't believe it's been 2 whole years since this trash game came out. Anyone in 2025 rewatching this to make fun of it again?
Yes it is that bad
Forspoken? More like Forgoten.
Call me crazy but I think that voice of the bracelet is the same as the VA of Wheatley
It's kind of funny that the only cool character in this game is the bracelet xD
15:36 now THATS a good voice actor
"35:42 ""My sheeps have run amok"" :D"
3:24 oh my god he actually bite them…
Top comment is gay
Game Of This Year LMAO OJ comes out with the funniest shit.
I see you're mostly dressed in the fabled Cloak of ROG Strix.
14:29 - OJ's perfect timing for comedy is impeccable.
Now that we have Dragon Age Veilguard to make this game's writing look like Tolkien by comparison.
"OK they have the same sh...y writing, but even Failguard had at least Fathers. And some of the man could actually do stuff. Forspoken has nothing of that."
UGLY CHARACTER
"Mother this, mother, that mother my eye. 😂😂😂"
"Coming back to this in 2025 makes you think ""maybe this wasn't so bad?"""
"Yeah I'm 8 hours in now myself and enjoying it well enough.
Definitely wouldn't have ever paid $70 for it, but as a title that Playstation is giving away for ""free"" (subscription), it's a pretty enjoyable romp so far.
Though my word it took me three sitdowns with it to actually start having fun, that prologue was awful lol."
"I've just completed it, and it was bad. Got this for free as well."
"4 out of 10? I can't believe you guys rated this higher than Veilguard lmao

I didn't play both games."
I love this intro an jimmy
"Look at the bright side, you might be able to claim this one as a loss on taxes."
Honestly this is one of my favorite intros from you guys. Jimmy needs to lay off the cocaine.
"I know joe this game chould have been good if it was written by actual talented writers and better producers and directors but MAN the writing and dialogue is AWFUL  
and annoying cringy and stupid and btw the main actress ella balinska admit she did not like her performance at all so maybe she probably will get better roles in the future maybe if she had a better agent and work with better and smart people and this game deserves its 4/10 100% and the tantas do made me laugh for being so over the top crazy villains by being so bad but funny at the same time 😂😂😂😂😂 i just can't take them seriously at all like my god what were they thinking just wow like are you serious this is just crazy,btw joe love your vids and stay healthy and stay awesome"
Is like the main character is based on the typical pink poosy  hat blue hair lefty and they aren't trying for it to be a caricature. It's serious.  Lol
"Everything is written by AI, these days."
"The worst thing about this  game is thst it has possibility of being good, the gsmkley is not garbage but the story and characther, expecially the main characther are a little garbage"
That leaving bag of cash is really bothers me 😂 why go back to a room IN A BURNING APARTMENT?!
"32:15 Not to be that guy. But wouldn’t it be that you look conspicuous…. Inconspicuous would be to blend in, to not stand out."
This was the game that definitely got SE to open their eyes about abolishing DEI BS
"Was looking on PlayStation Plus, it’s free, but before I downloaded I searched for Angry Review
Yeah nah, not even Free
I hated the character but you lost me at Slow Walking anyway
I hate forced slow walking in games more than anything else on the planet, with the exception of Woke remakes or sequels or Race swapped Samurai
Thanks not touching it.. even free"
19:48!!  Thats what modern design is about now.  Buckin to buck!  And at least your ufks have some kind of swag
playing the game and it's not that bad despite some of the cringe dialog. i like the battle system. i just wish the enemies where varied and had better ai because the game is easy even on very hard.
They did fix a few things like no map loading issue.   Among other things
Need a swear jar.   We would be rich as FFFFFUUU…. NK… 😂🫠
"Also,notice that none of the people playing this game are young black women and yet they found things they like in the game!"
"Leave it 2 a hypocrite like Joe, to criticize ""cursing""...in the same SENTENCE as blaspheming"
"Funny how he keeps talking up Final Fantasy, but the way he describes this game is the way I see FFXV... I hated it, it was the most boring $@!7 I ever played."
"Always a good game when the highlight is petting Fake digital cats🤣🤦🏼‍♂. OMFG, how SquareEnix has shit themselves. And this desperate, sexist sadness is how they will be remembered for a long time... 😔"
What a shitty review.
"Just got this because PSN gave it for free, and I'm glad i didnt pay for it.

Its been an hour and i hate the game already. There is waaaaaay to much talking and waaaaay too many cutscenes. We could have skipped chapters 1 to 3 which is about an 40 to hour long, and just show a quick 5 to 10 minutes opening cutscene to established she was isekai'd and then move on 

Having to walk from 1 cutscene to the other should be considered a war crime. And worse yet is being forced to either walk snails paced when talking or having to fully stop when talking to cuff, when she could simplify ask those questions while moving or during the cutsceness 

They failed fo produce a good game because they didnt focus on the actual game play they focused on cutscenes and talking"
So the break is basically the blight? What an original twist.
