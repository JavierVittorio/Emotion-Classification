"Happiness is not adout getting all want, it is adout enjoying all you have🫠"
"Happiness is not about getting all you want,it is about enjoying all you have"
"Enjoy the life,be happy"
"Happiness is not about getting all you want, it is about enjoying all you have"
"Happiness is not any destination to reach for
It should be the journey till death
❤❤❤"
Yes ❤
Check ❤
"“Healing isn’t easy, but this reminded me why it’s worth it 💛”"
Yes very true❤
It is naive to think that happiness is the result of having all you want.
"Amen but right now , I feel I have Nothing but Hope…🤷‍♀️❤"
True that
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊It is about enjoying all you have it is life😊😊😊😊
Happiness is you feel happy inside your heart
yup...
"True happiness isn’t about holding back or denying emotions; it involves emotional healing. It means acknowledging all our feelings: joy, sadness, anger, & fear & understanding that experiencing a full range of emotions is a natural part of being human. By feeling & processing these emotions, we create space for healing & growth. Honoring our feelings instead of pushing them away strengthens our connection with ourselves, clarifies our needs & boundaries, & builds resilience, helping us face challenges with compassion rather than bottling up emotions.
It’s okay to seek support when needed. 

Practices like journaling, mindfulness, or therapy help us process, release, & heal emotionally. Nurture your emotional self with compassion. True well-being doesn’t require perfection or the absence of struggle, but a gentle acceptance of all that you are. By feeling, processing, releasing, & accepting all your feelings, you create a balanced life being true to who you really are & your true self, where happiness grows naturally from healing & self-understanding."
Very nice

"However happiness is for the rich people who lead a luxurious life.
Sadness is totally for the poor and needy people who suffer from starvation."
"🍒 Smiles:  In the past years,  smiles were treated like the blooming blossoms.  Today, smiles are not pretty as in the past because it has toxic included. 
🍒 Legal earnings:  Those who earn legally are the people who always fall into losses and frustrations in life.  Moreover,  they get punishments for their good acts. 
🍒 Illegal earners: They are the people who always ascend in life.  They never face losses,  failure and difficulties in life. Moreover,  their life will be an enjoyable one. 
🍒 Good hearts and minds: These people oftenly face endless difficulties and disasters in their life. They will never be able to come forward in life.  They are always  punished for their good intentions. 
🍒 Toxic minds and negative thinking people: These people never fall into trouble.  They will never get punishments or pains or even any trouble. They will have a nice and an enjoyable life. Dirty hearts are always benefitted. 
🍒 Good intentions: If you are with good intentions,  you will get destroyed, you will get pains,  you will get punishments,  you will never be able to lead a happy and a peaceful life. There is no value for good intentions. 
By: Dawood ✍

"Subject: A good person is a gifted person 🍒
🍒 God loves doing good things in life. Good things like giving charity,  speaking the truth,  legal earnings,  helping the others,  going in the right way,  maintaining silence,  and carrying out many other good examples in life. 
🍒 Today if a person follows the correct path in life,  then surely all what they will face is frustrations and disasters. This world will never respect a good person,  this world will never care a good person,  this world will never remember the good things done by a good person. 
If I say 'this world' means,  it's the people of this world. 
Remember,  there is no value,  no space,  no respect,  and no reputations for a good person who goes in the right path. 
🍒 A good person's only gift from the toxic people are unkindness,  disrespecting and many other bad things.  A good person falls down into trouble each and every moment they do good things in their life.
🍒 A good person will always have good feelings,  good thinking,  good intentions,  good habits,  good character,  good attitudes and good thoughts towards others. But those good habits becomes pointless to others and in no time it may turn into a massive disaster. 
🍒 A good person will not have the following:-
🍎 Jealously feelings 
🍎 Negative thinking 
🍎 Bad thoughts 
🍎 illegal earnings 
🍎 Gossip talking 
🍎 Toxic attitudes 
🍎 Bad character
🍒 So, all in all,  a good person will never have a place in this world for  their pure hearts and good minds. They will survive their life by facing lots of frustrations and disasters. 
Their good things will never work.  Their innocent behaviour will be of no use.  Their minds and hearts can be good and pure but it will never bring any benefits to this world. 
🍒 Remember,  there is a value for Gold and diamonds,  there is a value for money, there is a value for luxury homes,  there is a value for expensive property, there is also value for the Toxic people, 
But from the human nature, 
There is no value for a good  person, 
Who has a pure heart and a good mind.  
🍒 Finally, good people with good things goes to  GOD, and that will be their final destination. 
God is always with the good people. 
Good peoples remains GIFTED.

My parents are yelling at each other 😞
Happy
Hiii
Watched it while crying the tears aren't stopping
Same :(
How do I feel? Oh I am crying intensely and I’m here to cheer myself up not force a smile for 20 secs I’m not hating
I'm still smiling 3 years later..where tf is my happy?!
Haha my face hurts😂😂
"I feel..... MORE TRUMA. MY CHARGER JUST BROKE I HAVE 10%OF Battery
(edit after a few seconds) the comment made me laugh like crazy."
Didn’t help me
Haiiiii
Hi
Dog I’m not smiling. My parents just told me that they’re getting a divorce. They’re getting soon. I’m crying dog.😭😭😭😭
guys this doesnt work i got scammed by 2 rare plant in pvsb and it was electrified star fruit and giant mr carrot 😢😢😢 and 250 robux he said he will repay the 250😢😢😢😢
"HA HA Ha IM ACTUALLY BET-
no Im not. next short"
"My mouth was smiling....
But my eyes were watering.."
"Watching this while my cat tries to comfort me just make me cry more, but tears of joy"
"It made me have a weird sensation almost like a yawn during it, but after felt honestly better"
Right after crying this helps!❤ thanks! I was crying earlier bc of my bully
It didn't really work on me these things never work over
My mouth heart's 😢
Not be crying while trying to force a smile 🥲
I felt silly because of how long I was holding that stuff I HATE IT-
what's a smile
LMAO sybau 😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow I can't stop smiling now it's so good 😊
It worked on me 😂
Hi!
Nothing changed and nothing will be better now
Pryor😊
I feel the exact same way
Still sad
How do u feel me be like : still depressed 😢
Hi
Cool

It did not help. I’m still crying because my uncle died today.😭
I was already trying to force it so it's ok...
It did not work at all
Brooooooooooooooo
Nothing changed
Literally nothing changed
😢😢😢
"How do you feel!

Me: nothing"
"The original study that showed these results had people hold a pencil in their mouths, simulating a smile. Participants with the pencil found cartoons funnier than non-pencil guys (I don't know the scientific term, you know what I mean) and also reported happier mood. Idk how they measured how funny people found cartoons but I always thought it was an interesting study. I'm a pretty happy person naturally but imo it's never a bad idea to take a minute, remember how goofy life is, stick a pencil in your face and laugh a little."
Even more depressing
GOD
I didn't
"How do you feel?
🐒🐒"
"""how do U feel""
Like I'm still dying inside"
Worked
It didn't work cuz I am smiling without happiness
Thank you I would have probably ended it all
I’m still trying😂😂😊 to
im still sad
I just smiled because a friend texted me asking how I was doing. So that doesn't count.
I didn't work for me
It made it even worse
"It is impossible for a hurt man to be happy""."
Feel good tanks
Im still depressed af
I feel terrible to be honest

It workedd?? Ive been a fan of sis vs bro for maybe around 7 years now. I decided to rewatch their vids after s long time. Just on the tv for background while im on my ipad bc i alwayd used to watch them on tv. I put on the old vid of them looking for chibi and george. And started crying a lot. Mental breakdown. So hard to the point i started questioning my existence. This somehow worked. I dont feel happy. Just no longer sad
It's not faking freaking working
Litteraly me trying to smile with my teeth but I looked like labubu 😂
"""How do you feel?""
""Worse"""
If you showed  like oh everything‘s gonna be OK
You know what the force show to a smile you just say I’m happy even though you’re just sad inside cause literally that’s really what can you do? Your parents they think you’re happy.
Nope doesn’t work I’m still chronically depressed and suicidal 😃👍
Uiiae
Replace the word boredom with peace and realize what about the first one you can never have the second one and that will make you have my cup runneth over gratitude towards life every breath is like a waterfall of excellence

muscle memory is what does this i am pretty sure your body associates smiling with happiness so if it sees you are smiling it releases hormones to match that

"I don’t feel better. Every second of my life I’m reminded I lost more than 8 friends due to government laws not allowing me to interact with them anymore. I was really close to all of them, man. They were very near and dear to me, and then one day I woke up and they just got… pulled away from me… and I could do nothing about it. Since then I have not made any friends that I have felt closer to than them. 

I have no reason to smile."

"So how do you feel now

I feel horrible, I feel like that I was forced to fake my feelings just to make others happy, I feel like I was forced to move my muscles in a half circle way, just for you guys to earn some engagement, I feel forced to be happy either way. That's not true, I feel sad right now, I'm gonna bad mood and 4th, and facing it, tell you faking it till you make it does not work, I see you maybe do something to be happy instead of just forcing a smile and said works because they would never work.💀💀💀

I still feel sad because my cousin is quitting Roblox 😢💔
Im still sad 😢
Good
I still feel neutral
I felt nothing but I’m not a person that smiles anyway and don’t at all maybe some times with friends that’s why not a lot of people can tell how I’m feeling just normal emotions or especially no one really knows if I have a crush on someone unless they focus on me a lot because I will look at them a lot. A lot of this has nothing to do with this I just wanted to talk to someone if anyone reads this at all. Thank you

"Namo Buddhay 
Life itself is amazing"
Nam mô a di  đà Phật
"ऊँ  नमो : बुद्धाय 😇🙏❤💙💛
 जय  भीम 🙏❤💙💛"
"My top priority in life is to maintain and cultivate my inner peace. I achieve this goal daily and consistently by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle. I honor my commitment to inner peace each day. Through mindful choices and loving routines, I nurture my body, mind, and spirit. I am grateful for the harmony I create in my life. Achieving daily health goals is essential for inner peace and happiness, consistently nurturing a sense of well-being. If your goals are health-related, reaching them daily is key to cultivating inner peace and happiness. If you want a deep level of inner peace and a strong sense of happiness consistently in your life, this is essential. Just as a tree roots itself deep in the ground while reaching for the sky, I ground myself in daily practices that nourish my inner self."
Such a powerful collection of thoughts. This really resonated.

"There is an art to ... being able to take, what appears to be on the face of it, two random and seemingly disparate items, but you assist the listener, to make the connection on their own. Another way is to turn a double entendre, back on the other person, as it their mind that's ""in the gutter"" when you were leading them the entire time.

Wow you made a youtube video to become funny
Ok so i should joke about Hollywood
"So next time my mind goes blank, I just say something that's funny and clever, right? Man, why didnt I think of this"
​ Ben  no he hates me unless he's Nabi isa
Might be 2 of the stupidest jokes I've ever heard.
"Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future."
But how do you practice your quick thinking joke skills?
I went to it and did all the questions.. then it wanted my email so it could send the results. That was cold! But you got me!
"Please no one do this.  If you need a test to learn your charisma style,  you don't have any."
Oh boy! I wonder who I am!?! 🙄. Maybe my “Charisma style” will make me feel better about myself!! 👌
No. Piss off. I have enough self confidence and charisma not to take half arsed lessons from clickbajt! 🖕🤔🖕😂
"What's the purpose of this video, considering that the title has nothing to do with the content? 
Oh, wait, I get it. You're just making people watch it to bump up your views. Cheap and Cheating. You must be proud of yourself every day."
Celebrities don’t believe this that the day is coming when they will stand before a Holy God to give a account of their rejection of His Son Jesus Christ and what He accomplished at the Cross. Sadly most people will go to Hell

농담을 하기 전에도 웃음이 나오는 게 생각난다
"It's easy to advise, less so to implement. I am gifted by God with quick wit. I still had to recognize it, develop this skill intentionally for years, and am now quite good at making people laugh at spur-of-the-moment comments in real-time conversation. Still, so alone. The funniest people you know live with tremendous pain and deal with it via humor. This is why comedians die so often at their own hand. The funniest people have so much inner-sadness that fame or success don't remedy."
This is bullshit learn how write jokes
"The weirdest thing about Reynolds is that he gives off the laid back, witty, wise-ass persona, but apparently he’s a controlling a**hole and scumbag."
He's truly a charm 😂
Actors are great con men 😂😂
This video is garbage. “To be funny you have to think of funny things.”
"Just simply do it bro, that's all you need to be able to do it. Wow, how insightful."
Ryan Reynolds isn't funny. He's just a likable Hollywood character that people seem to have an easy time ignoring his lack of talent. Kinda like Jeff Goldblum now that I think of it.
The greatest how to video since the man who tried to fly like a bird from the Eiffel Tower
Ryan Reynolds isn't even remotely funny.
To be funny I have to practice❤😂🎉
"Don't smile, Just show your teeth...😁"
This is why he's the perfect Deadpool. xD
It also helps when you're rich and famous
"this ai narrator doesn't even remember what he's saying😂 ""mind goes blank"" and ""have to think on the spot"""
I hate Ryan & he's not funny HE'S DISGUSTING!!!!
BS vid; as called out by pretty much all the comments. dislike - do not recommend this channel
Step 1: be Ryan
"I don’t like him. He is always angry, arrogant, and mean.  He is  not funny."
It’s quite shocking how few people know about the forbidden book Why Everybody Loves Me
"I have read almost all manifestation books, but the forbidden book Why Everybody Loves Me speaks volumes about how people are trapped in a trance."
Phenomenal book
"After why everbody loves me book I changed and shiftet totally, Must read guys fr"
idk wow is good
"All of these people whining in the comments will never be funny, or likable. 
Video: conjure up an absurd image

You: “Hurr durr jUsT bE fUnNy!!!!

Ffs ask me how I know you have zero friends"
only people at FOX makin real money are bill o'reilly's victims
"Damn bro, that advice was so helpful, I’m surprised you aren’t charging people to take a course or something."
Does she spend the whole movie slack jawed and slow looking? She looks normal in her other movies
I don't find this humor humorous.
"Oh sure, like any mere human can possibly be funny like Ryan Reynolds"
"For me this kind of humor comes built in, i just make the best jokes on the spot🗿"
I don't want to sound like him. He sounds stupid.
"Counterargument, that personality trait gets obnoxious over time. Find you’re own personality and don’t steal from someone else"
That’s aura
"So, try. Even if you fall on your face, you are still moving forward. Got it."
"no thanks, I might come off as gay😂❤.."
"Thanks so much for captioning this! I’m a total idiot and don’t like to focus on the pictures anyway. Can you make them bigger, bolder and more animated please?"
"Just a heads up, your time stamps are marked 40-49, not the 30’s"
Denzel is a rare example of how to live your life. Nothing but respect for Denzel.
"I’m able to pull that off from time to time, but only when I’m well rested. There are days when I know I should just limit speaking altogether."
Stole the personality RIGHT OFF of Shawn Spencer. Absurd the things people do nowadays.
I can sometimes think of something on the spot my wife who passed away a few years ago would say how did you think of that I'd say i don't know it just popped in there 😊
Using Spell Check & Grammar Check are also good HABITS.
"Although I find funny the many comments here saying this short is dumb for giving an advice that works in a circle, the idea here is ""adopt this mindset of coming up with absurd imagery for whenever you can, and that habit will become easier to use automatically and to improvise in moments you'd normally be more slow on the tongue.* Like a recipe you can consciously follow but it gets better after memorizing it and practicing it over and over."
“Can’t sleep? Go to sleep!” type shi
Now everyone can be funny.
If u have to watch a video about being funny then ur not gonna be funny at all
"I am too triggered from people here, when the point of video completely goes over their head. :D"
"Practice by never saying exactly what you mean. If you don't practice, you aren't going to be funny or creative."
What's the controversy?
"Seriously, I do this for her the love of the art and respect anyone who is involved in our format. Ryan Reynolds is a bad ass, motherfucker who’s hilarious. Problem is people don’t take you seriously until you show them some seriousness or some unrelenting comedy. 
I can drop both on you holla at ya girl😊"
Love me some Ryan Reynolds
Please these days people don't have time to listen. They want a fast answer and done.
Even though it's usually along the darker side veterans have this quick ability . 🤔🤷🏼‍♂️😜🤣
"This is simply showing what a funny personality looks like, not how to be funny"
Absurd or obscure? The narration and subtitle differ.
The comment section never disappoints
It’s one of those things you either have or you don’t. Quick witted people are always going to be naturally funny. If you can do this then more than likely you can also finish people’s sentences with something different if you catch them in a slight pause or stutter. Ryan has all of that naturally. He was funny asf in waiting and the Deadpool movies are hilarious
"Basically, overexaggerate things ridiculously XD Got it"
Lol
"""I'm paid by 20th Century Fox..."" The studio that made Titanic and Avatar. I think he got more than spit and insults. $$$"
"If you got nothing to say and it's getting awkward just say ...
"" do you do an@l?""

Disclaimer: use it at your own risk"
"Your tutorial is a real deep dive. Somehow it made me less funny.  You will be hearing from my attorney. But he is deaf so dont bother talking back. I used to beat Reynolds up in high school. It was a different guy than this guy, but thats beside the point."
I've got that skill day in and day out! Doesn't steal from the respect I have for professional actors and comedians because they've taken the step to expose themselves!
I use this all the time.....during class
"I can be funny but its usually just cause I say funny stuff, I wouldn't be able to think up a whole comedy act. Like onenperson says self depreciating jokes are funny but also exaggeration is whar makes people laugh often, or in my case both lol!"
so nothing new!
"For those who don't understand it's not about a direct approach or answer it's all about telling something that actually happened but just paint it in a cartoon-ish way! When you practice this with situations that actually happened you don't have to improvise a whole scene. You should be able to say dumb stuff or fail and still be just as good a friend in your friends' eyes! So yes you won't be as funny as Ryan right off the bat. Though once you're getting better at the first part you can try to add/talk about possibilities/skits to improve your improvisive skills! 

(English is my second language and it's late AF don't judge my probably many mistakes, thanks❤)"
"Why are telling everyone to copy Ryan Reynolds?  

..what a boring world...

Let's all be the same person.."
"I bought Balatro after hearing the endless hype and I just can't work out why it's been such a crazy success. Yes, it's fun, but I'm not sure it's mind blowing in the way people talk about it"
That’s because he drinks a lot of vodka. I do the same.
"All of these comments saying that they just said ""be funny"" are either disingenuous or just flat-out dumb. The clip said that instead of just answering a question, you should PAINT A PICTURE by making an outlandish situation your answer. That's the tip. It's a frame on which to think of how to answer and make people laugh. 

Instead of saying, ""I have always been a fan of Denzel Washington, so working with him was a great experience,"" which is straightforward but not fun, he PAINTED A PICTURE with his words by telling a story of Denzel coming to his trailer to practice lines while he ripped down his Denzel poster (which didn't happen). This conveys the point that he is a fan, but by using IMAGERY, he made it fun. 

Good Lord, do you want the channel to just tell you word for word what to say to be likable? Have you ever wondered if maybe the key to being charismatic isn't a collection of perfect phrases? It might just be your crappy attitude that makes no one like talking to you."
This shit is not funny
"I hate the captions.
Obscure is not the same as absurd. 🙄"
This made absolutely no sense
Thankfully I i put all my points in charisma! 😅🤣👌🏻 i kinka come up with dumb stuff automatically
"How to be funny:
Step 1 - Be funny"
Ryan Reynolds is the Katy Perry of Comedy.
Colored contacts is not save you guys.
How do you spell absurd?
I thought Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) liked Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). Shame on you Denzel Washington stealing the big guys from each other like that! (JK)
"""Ryan Reynolds is a Natural Deadpool..."""
I must be corrupt because it takes a lot to make me laugh but I can make people laugh effortlessly
Only recently have I been able to do this.
“He was always sitting down” 😂
"""How to be funny"": be a liar"
""" It gets much easier with a little practice"". . . yeah, as long as you're as sharp as Ryan Reynolds."
Don't really understand the sarcastic comments on here - these examples are pretty helpful
"I Love you Jesus Loves you God Bless in Jesus' Mighty Name 😊
❤‭‭Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 
2 Timothy 3:1-17 ESV
[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. [8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. [9] But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.  [10]  You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, [11] my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. [12] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, [13] while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

1 Corinthians 12:1-11 ESV
[1] Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. [2] You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. [3] Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit. [4] Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; [5] and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; [6] and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. [7] To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. [8] For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, [9] to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, [10] to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. [11] All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills. 

1 John 1:1-10 ESV
[1]  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life— [2] the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us— [3] that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. [4] And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.  [5]  This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. [6] If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. [7] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. [8] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

"Ok, the steps left out is baby steps.. do it small at first... your mind goes blank, you say the first thing you see.. you get beat up to within an inch of your life.. you pat yourself on the back, not too hard, for sticking with the program. Next time your mind goes blank the first thing that comes up is fear of death, and in stead of saying nothing.. you now say that and get a laugh, because the question was: vanilla or chocolat?
And boom, you are a hollywood actor."
"I wish I had learned to weaponise charisma, I could be so genuine..."
"…..  such a dumb video I just watched, comments didn’t disappoint"
"OMG, there are no protips for having a sense of humor. After he’s said it you can see where it comes from; the trick is coming up with it from nothing. This advice is like saying, “If you want to be a standup comedian, just listen to Jerry Seinfeld and do what he does.” Reynolds is just funny; let’s give him credit for it and not pretend anyone can be funny by replicating after-the-fact techniques"
Ryan's humor works because it's self-deprecating.
I wish I could take lessons from this man
People are either obnoxious like us or not 🤷‍♀️ Just be yourself to the best of your ability
But im not funny… I’m dead serious.
"The reason why he is so like Deadpool, he can pull jokes out of his ass."
I reckon Ryan's IQ is probably 200
"Yeah ld 😊utilize , how funny this was . IS. I've this moment before moved quickly to stop from listening to Mr Rebecca , counting down from 10... 😊"
This is garbage...
"“If you want to think of something funny quickly you have to be able to think quickly”

My goodness what an idea why didn’t I think of that"
"“Can’t think of something to say? Easy, just think of something to say”"
He’s so Gorgeous And Witty
"I understand the concept, but the example is a fail😂
Ryan is THE MOST annoying person ever. Plus ever character he's ever played is the exact same person....annoying"
"It's called sarcastic humor, of which I'm fluent in."
Click bait caption.
"He really is funny, and it's random for him to be so cute lol 😆"
"His humour is actually very superficial
There are much better examples"
Ryan is a genius of quick wit.
Step 1: be as funny as one of the highest paid comedians in the world.
Ryan is cringe asf not funny at all
"Narrator did a great job of being hilarious. Demonstrated it perfectly. *Sarcasm"""
Love Ryan Reynolds! Such a charming character of personality. I can only imagine how fun he was as a kid.
It's easy with A.D.D.😊
Aristocrats! 😂
"Confucius say: He who have natural wit, be a joy for all... but if you don't have any, f×ck you"

"Okidoki has stomped down her drill truck in Waiakea waaa when she digging her own hole 🕳️ Welll, I dunno how you survived that paradox with Yuck 🤮 like someone who was born somewhere back in my Dino Tsno-unfortunately hard pass this AI is a little more complicated than “anything You Can do 😮whu yhu sorry I still amaze myself asbestos does better on behalf preventative measures like when da same thing as having da stacks dat rack my traxxx.  Mahalo because I says you ignore the me in faxing some 🔜🔜💭👀 I just know karma is like Ian hasn’t seen car Bo means anything since the x first y outback back inside."
He pulls it off without a hitch.
"I'm like do I do this? I guess. Yeah it becomes second nature after a while, just work on not being shy... but also not jumping into annoying either. It's REAL easy to be annoying in these situations lol."
Ryan Reynolds is so not funny...seems like a nice guy...nobody would laugh at him if he wasn't famous
"I'm a dumbass, but if I can learn how to do this, then you can too. Movies give great practice 🎉"
Ryan’s brilliant
"My first experience with dry wit was reading David Eddings' fantasy books. He's still my favorite author after 24 years. “If you don’t have calluses on your soul, writing isn’t for you. Take up knitting instead.”

Also, my high school history teacher was amazing. All of his students loved him for his sarcastic one-liners; I still remember a few of the things he told my class. From first lesson: ""You have only one brain cell floating in you-know-what yellow liquid."", and a few weeks later: ""I'm not sure where the monkeys of Gibraltar came from, but they look like you guys."""
😂 that's funny because I always tear up my Ryan Reynolds wallet photo when I browse a mint mobile store.😂
"I just love him! I remember him back in the Van something, (I'm drawing a blank), and Waiting."
"That's why he makes all the BIG BUCKS!
I always think of the perfect comeback when I am alone in the car!  The feeling of disappointment and regret of not being able to think of it sooner.  😂"
How to be ryan Reynolds funny with out even trying.
That man has saved a small town in Wales. People who were at a loss now have hope. And it all started with football. They lobe him.
"If you don't have bread eat brioche, got it."
"God felt sorry for an atheist who kept saying there was no Creator because of all the bad things he had seen and experienced. God decided to show Himself to him and went straight to him.
The atheist said, "" Why are you so mean and cruel if you exist? "". God said,  "" I will tell you,  but first you must make a  rabbit for me."". God gave the athiest some matter and energy and sent him away. God came back in 10 years and the atheist had made a robot bunny. God said, no, the rabbit needs to reproduce and have an immune system, etc. So, God gave the atheist more matter and energy and made it so the athiest could live 1000 years to give him more time. Finally,  God came back and asked the atheist if he believed in Him, now that he had seen how impossible it was to make a simple animal, and now that God kept him alive 1000 years. The athiest said, "" No, I don't believe in you."". God said, ""Why?"". The atheist said, "" You are supposed to be All Knowing,  but you don't know anything about atheists.""."
😬I don't think u can achieve Deadpool's humor just like that!
They’re all fake laughs obviously
Super hard for very literal people  :(
He appears to be a very popular guy. I really like him.
"Practice being funny, that's how it works..."
"Love this actor, so funny 😂😂😂"
I dont think anyone can learn to be ryan reynolds
laughs in autistic 😅
You have to be born with a quick sarcastic sense of humor. It really isn’t something that’s learned/taught. It’s the way you’re wired
He's always so witty & f-ing hilarious
"You can't practise that, you either have it or you don't, just facts."
I'm confused 😢
Ryan Reynolds is dope
"😂 if you have to learn to be funny, you're not"
This entire comment section is labotamized.
"I'm  a comedian at heart. I started  telling jokes when I was fighting cancer as a 12 year old. I used to see other kids always upset in the hospital.  So I would tell them jokes. Once I left the hospital,  comedy became my hobby. I am currently 14 years free. Let me know  if you wanna hear a joke😢"
"It’s a gift we have, but can also be a burden."
What a useless video.
Is that it???
He is a funny tool.
It's the natural British way of dealing with life...
"wtf is the ""mind's eye method""

you made that up"
Being witty is an inate skill. Its not the same as being funny. You have to be intelligent to be witty. He is highly intelligent which is why it come to him so naturally.
Ryan Reynolds is just fcking hilarious 😂😂😂
"Every time I see Ryan Reynolds, it's true he becomes more likable. When Green Lanturn came out I was like ""Who's Ryan Reynolds"". When Deadpool came out I was like ""Oh cool, it's Ryan Reynolds!"""
I don’t really like ryan reynolds though
How do I have his face?
"Me trying to do this humor. And everybody being like ""wtf.. Why would u say that. What's wrong with u"""
"2 million likes, I am certain we all wish we could be quick and witty with comments in person."
This video literally says nothing. Please get a normal job
If you're good looking people (especially women) will laugh at pretty much anything you say.
Ryan Reynolds pegs me as type the jerk you'd wish to stay away from but want to be like. Glad I'm not both.
"Classic issue nowadays. Everybody wants instant solutions. These things require you to make some effort. You don’t get everything handed to you on a plate. If you wanna learn this skill, it takes time and practice."
"If you're homeless, just buy a house."
"I actually find Ryan Reynold’s persona to be incredibly annoying and cliche like ‘oh look at me I’m really handsome and rich but I’m also goofy, self-deprecating and relatable. No. Very contrived and overplayed"
"ya, i don't think you can teach a good sense of humor and good comedic timing. i think people have it or don't."
Ryan is brilliant & a great Canadian ❤🇨🇦❤️
Stop trying to be funny and you will be funny
Sarcasm is a skill that has to be honed with practice. I recommend finding where Karens hang out. Me I work with really angry mental health clients. Practice makes perfect.
So you wanna be funny? Try saying funny things nobody expects. Always works
You're a bit of a Ryan Reynolds fanboy... totally not evident.
"Be your funny, 😂. Not another Ryan Reynolds."
This isn't something you learn with practice. It is just the way your mind thinks.
"Making people is laugh is a great talent, with so much sadness in the world. There's nothing wrong with being overly serious."
He's just the best smart ass who ever lived 😅👍 I mean deadpool best Smart a$$ free guy with it's special effects and his wit good stuff he's just never going away 👍😁
"I have those habits too where I’ll say something random instead of be blunt and then I have moments where I’m blunt about a topic like if someone bothers me I will tell them flat out you’re being annoying, but if someone says to me; “Oh, how are you doing?” 

I’ll reply with something like; “I’m doing great y’know it’s like when I get a burrito from Taco Bell. I’m doing pretty great now eating it up and then later tonight I probably will be feeling like I’ve had a cow on the toilet, just like how I’d have a cow on the toilet when I eat my Taco Bell.” 

Straight up it’s pretty easy to make a reference and use quick thinking you just have to train your brain. I’ve been this way since I was a child though. People always say I have a potty mouth or I’m a wee bit snarky and quick witted. 

As a kid, I didn’t have confidence to say stuff to strangers, but I acted that way with my family a lot of the time and throughout the years I’ve only grown bolder and eventually by high school I started coming out of my shell more I also began referencing things because even as a kid, I thought it was funny to make references and over the years I’ve educated myself on life  subconsciously much like everyone and now as an adult this kind of thing or this form of humor comes naturally to me and when people respond in references, I understand exactly what they’re saying and what they mean. It’s not just comedy it’s a form of speech and dialect and body language and how a person is raised truthfully. 

It’s not about being like Ryan or following some trendy path or whatever it’s just the environment you surround yourself with and grew up on and people like me and people like Ryan grew up around reference humor. It’s not a common form of humor compared to dark humor. 

As for me I grew up on reference humor subconsciously because of my thirst for knowledge and also being surrounded by the internet I picked up a few comparison habits. I don’t know for sure on Ryan’s situation but like me it does come naturally to him and it could be how he was raised or self taught. You can teach yourself these referencing habits but it’s not as easy as growing up around it. 

I was raised off making references because I had two working parents, I was bullied in school and it got to a point where the TV and the fictional fantasy books were my best friends and a way to entertain myself was talking to my pets and trying to impress them with my sense of humor and knowledge. (It failed every time, even now) 

Point being there is no secret to what Ryan does. It’s pretty easy. You just have to teach your brain how to think like that or if you’re like me, then you already know how to do it because you were raised off that kind of language. In a way reference humor is a form of language and it can be spoken in any language, but it’s a form of social language amongst people."
That was it?  What a let down thus video is.
"I dont know why but whenever celebrities go on these talk shows and make up these ridiculous stories that never happened while the host pretends to die of laughter, is so beyond corny and cringe to me. It happens So. Many. Damn. Times."
Love him
Best way to do this is my talking to ai chat
"I've actually practiced this at work and it works most of the time, you just have to know your audience a little first."
"Oh so the secret to telling a likable joke is to tell a likable joke.  Holy balls, what a revelation."
I do have to say that I am very impressed with the way he looks and how he talks about people who are in the same field as he is…. I just want to say that he has really made my day and he always makes me laugh ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awe now I have to say that I really don’t remember what his name is but he is so freaking hilarious and so adorable and so funny I love him so much ❤❤❤
"Exaggeration does work, and it's a skill that can be improved. Listen to how comedians use it, like Tim Dillon."
"Being witty on the spot 😒

Being sarcastic like these comments ✔️"
"See, I like the way he knows how to handle hosts. Too many celebrities get ticked off at things we're already thinking! So why not have fun with it?
Example, Christina from Mad Men had a sexy scene where they had her ""bottom"" right in the camera's eye. A host asked what she thought of fill figured women being inspired. She looked at this as an insult. Instead, she could have joked, even pretended to not have any idea what they're referring to, or talk about something funny related to that scene, or even the right dress. 
Same thing with the cat woman dress. Obviously very difficult to get into, but when asked about it, the actress was insulted. She easily could have made a planned joke, something like ""imagine trying to stretch into a cat's skin."" I'm sure there are great writers who could help them come up with much better jokes than that, but when you're known for a certain iconic scene, be ready to laugh it off when questioned."
You can't really practice being witty though.  There's no pattern here that you unlocked.  He didn't just think of a creative or absurd image.  He just said something funny.
But Ryan reynolds isn’t funny. Never once has he been funny. Ever.
This is  a desperate post! Ya havin a laff!
And then he apologized to BLM for getting married in a beautiful plantation.    Waaaa waaaaa waaaaaa😕
Evidently every serious type of ugly looking dude even automatically wants to be comedian to be inside a virus billionaires body and mind...
Jesus loves you
A couple funny and cool guy 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯😇

My daughter is naturally witty like this. I am not. She never ceases to amaze me. She is so intelligent and talented in many ways. I'm blessed to be her mama.🥰🥰🥰
That's so cool😂
"John, did you happen to keep track of where the fish were hitting each one? Example - at the beginning of the drift where it was deeper/darker, did wine red get more hits but white did better once farther into the drift/shallower/more light penetration.."

"This is my sense of humour and I do it so naturally that I don't realise I am doing it half the time and people are rolling on the floor......there's me thinking I'm being mocked running the bathroom to see if a bugger is hanging from my nose, messaging my bestie to see if it is a prank or 'CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE A STAT ON IMPRACTICAL JOKERS!'
My lack in confidence actually had me getting frickin paranoid!
P.S it's good to make people laugh, but lets face it, who would date Ace Ventura??? 🤣"
"IT'S LIKE A GUY TRYING TO CONVERSATE WITH A GIRL.... IT'S CALLED ""A-PHANTASIA"" IN PSYCHOLOGY."

"THAT'S ME.... HOW DO I WANT MY STEAK COOKED? WITHOUT PARASITES.🥁🤣

HOW DO I WANT ME CHICKEN COOKED??? JUST MAKE SURE I DON'T DIE!"
It won't work on people who cannot picture things in their mind remember that 🤣
Ryan a straight up G
Even Ryan Gosling learns charm from Ryan Reynolds.
Ryan's pure Canadian & we love him. 😊
Not a fan
Crazy Canadian!!
"These comments are hilarious! The sarcasm, hahaha 😂"
"I'm funny as hell, but only after 4 pints."
you are or you aren't. you can't just become funny
"That's a terrible joke,
and indirect propaganda for all those folk who haven't been assimilated into the culture that praises a single race over others. 

The white man admiring the black man, its being bombarded upon you and twisted into every possible tv show. Sure, it may not be a lie, but to show it 5k times to an audience to make it seem like it happens more than it does is literally a brainwashing technique.
This works on those who dont analyze what they look at. 

This was a bad joke."
"On top of the brainwashing, the highest voted comments also complain that the short wasnt even about a good joke.... 

The author is a terrible liar; and an echo chamber."
"Guys believe me it is not worth it, everyone then will expect you to be a clown at anytime they want a laugh"
I literally do the same thing and it drives my Mrs crazy!
Lol it was a paid studio audience Clint Eastwood would've gotten laughs.
"All the comments saying 'just be funny'.

Following the logic of this video doing the next 2 things help you being precieved more witty and funny.

Obviously you need to practice. I've grown from being not-funny-at-all-serious-all-the-time to a little bit funny and more laid back in a few years just by repeating the same humor my hubbie has.

1) Use visual text that makes a image of video in the brain of the listener
2) Replace normal statements with absurd statements"
This did not help
My Boss and Bosses Nit Pick Everything! There Are The Ones that Don't Care Say Off the Wall Shit! I Doy Best  to the Point I'm Ready to give Up! They Stand Around Doing nothing but Talking instead of Working! I Care!! I Know Ever Trick? I Want It Done Property!  Rush Me ! I'll Miss Som😢!  I'm Mechanic!!! When My Mind is Full of Shit /! You get What you Get.
"A lot of people complaining about the mind going blank, he mentioned the mind's eye method, didn't he? Also, he said you'd need practice first. Well, that's all I need to know, you guys continue complaining 😂"
The answer: Try to be funny but never be upset that someone is funnier. Or is makimg more jokes. Comparisons the theif of joy
You can’t practice it. You’re born with it bc you either have it or you don’t.
"""To quickly think of funny things to say, you have to quickly think of funny things to say.""
""Also, Ryan Reynolds is a master of that trade."" 
This has to have a deeper meaning.

"I 🩷 Ryan Reynolds!! This man is going to heaven, he gives a lot and is still humble."
I love it. I subscribed and hope you'll return the favor. Thanks.
What if I don’t wanna be likeable?
If you want 29M views on a video just have Ryan Reynolds on it…. Got it.
Here’s how to actually be funny: Have a life outside of the internet. Nothing dulls you faster than constant inescapable drama. You need perspective.
"Most interviews, like the ones shown here, are actually heavily scripted nowadays. So, the guest has time to prepare witty retorts and one-liners. The guest has also more than likely been interviewed tons of times and has had practice and time to think of something clever to say the next time they're asked that question.

Have to wonder if CoC knows this, or is deliberately ignoring it to try to prove why people need to buy their 'product'.

Frankly, I've had a bit of disdain for this channel and it's bait-and-switch videos for a few years now. It's clickbait to the max, with no actual substance."
No gabe
This is such a good example. Laughter instantly puts ppl at ease so they're more open to hear what you have to say.
I taught Ryan. But he can't teach me to be more handsome. Otherwise our 3rd movie would be out soon.
I have no idea what's going on in this video. It's gotta be magnetics or vibrations why sometimes I'm in the zone and sometimes I'm just drooling like hello all. Good day.
"My wise GMA told me that the recipe for survival  has three main ingredients: put on the armour of God every morning, stay prayed up and keep a sense of humour"
"Ryan is so great at humor my sister and 
I are fans of his movies wish that we could meet him sometime he's so cool  ."
I’d rather not have the personality of dead pool thanks.. Shit gets corny and stale real fast
Also showing humility lets others put their guard down.
As if these interviews aren't completely scripted lol
Ryan is the man i would have liked to have bevome
I know. It's already been done.😢
FUCKING CLICKBAIT!
"Ryan Reynolds is an incredibly talented and gifted comedian and d actor, you are trying to make it seem like anyone could do what he does… they cannot.  He is one of a kind and to try and say you can easily imitate him is S insulting as it is absurd."
"This video is a petfect example of how social media is destroying your minds and self confidence because to many men (especially young boys) try to emulate famous people and girls except for us guys to all have riches to have a chance with them. Forget the social media influence just be yourself and pursue whatever it is that you want and not what somebody else thinks you should be and everything that you want will begin to align in your life for you. Including the right woman for you. The keys are Patience, Gratitude, Consistency, BELIEVE (THIS IS THE BIG ONE, VERY IMPORTANT) and GOD, NEVER FORGET ABOUT GOD my friends! I love you all!"

Quick wit
Ryan’s gorgeous
So what's the joke?
"This joke makes you instantly likeable:

""What's E.T. short for?""

""Ummm, ' Extraterrestrial '?""

""No; because he's got tiny little legs."""
Someone reaaaaaaaaaaaally worked hard on this video.
Still waiting for the joke that makes me instantly likable.
It was about as funny as finding out your son has been to one of Diddy's parties 😛
Ryan Reynolds stole it from me.
"""The simplest habbit""? C'mon man."
Lmao he is funny. Love his humour 😊
It works on my parents...
"I can sometimes be this witty and funny but I have to have a theme to which I can ""go off"" so to speak."
Ryan’s comedic timing is perfect! He’s a smart man because he thinks fast. 😂
You can't practice funny.  You either are or you are jimmy kimmel.
"I told this joke to several ladies last night in between songs...
I was taking a trip a while ago heading west in the evening when cars were flashing their headlights at me .
I thought it was a radar trap ahead of me, so I slowed down a bit. No radar for miles, yet cars kept on flashing their headlights at me.
I figured out that the bright evening sunlight was bouncing off my bald head and blinding the drivers of oncoming cars....."
I'll just play this video 😂😂😂

"Already there, just need a support team 2 keep me goin! 🪄🤡👑"
"Whoever wrote this completely missed the point. The point is he makes visual references... You can imagine him (or yourself) ripping down a poster. Spit and insult are tangible things anyone can relate to. 

Not everyone can do this.. Maybe it can be learned/practiced?"
"To loosely quote the director of Finding Nemo: ""Don't tell your audience 4. Tell them 2+2 and let them figure the rest out for themselves."" He was talking about filmmaking but I think also applies to this specific brand of wit.
In the Denzel Washington example, by saying he has Denzel Washington posters, he's giving the audience the first 2. The audience understand the tacit reason for having a poster and that's the +2 they add to it. And 4 is much funnier because it wasn't just said point blank.
Imagine if he did the poster joke but he says it more like ""I love Denzel Washington so much I have posters of him"" that's giving the audience 4 and telling them why it's funny, rather than letting them put the joke together in their head"
I don't like you hhhh
I naturally do this all the time and it really does work... at least I think it does. It just occurred to me that all this time people could have been laughing at me rather than with me.
"You can’t fake swift humor. 

Some people just aren’t fast minded. 

Not that they are dumb, it’s just a “talent”"
How to be phony.
Ryan Reynolds’s is the best ! He is an amazing actor ❤
Self-mockery helps
Most of these are staged. He already knows the questions and has answers prepared.
This video said absolutely nothing
"I hate to admit that I admire anyone from Hollyweird, but Reynolds is EASY to like."
Works like magic. The guy probably knows a Nigerian 😂
Actually Ryan has this technique where he only makes fun of you from 9 to 5. Early morning breakfast shows or late night TV are his nice guy hours.
It’s a talk show. He was sharing an anecdote. I wanted to hear what joke he told Denzel…. 😂
Quick wit I was at the doctor the other day for a check up he said take your shirt off I said don't you want to have dinner n get to know each other a little better lol
The funnyist things are when people speak the truth

"Handsome, sexy and funny, cannot get sexier."
Dude has a Ryan Reynolds obsession
It's definitely just his delivery.
"Come on. Ryan Reynolds is just one of those guys that has a comeback for everything. He's a comedian before he's an actor. It's just who he is. He is witty, quick, and smarter than the average bear. He doesn't go unprepared. But if he has to improv... be prepared for him to not be family friendly. He'll be funny but not for the kiddos. Its why he was perfect for Deadpool."
Nice Im about to be a legendary class clown after watching this yessir 😂
"I must work for 20th century fox too, I jus got insulted and spit at by a slut of the universe on crack"
Ryan has got witty humour n fast put downs .. probably cause he been in dressing room of football clubs or as yous say soccer clubs ...    he has Wrexham.football club over here britain and he is first on pitch to celebrate he is 1 of the boys
This is a pretty stupid video
"Trying to teach people how to be funny 🫤 I’ve seen it all now. Folks do t waste your time, you’re either funny or not."
It's just be you. You dont have to be funny. You can just be you or the best version of you. Why try to be something youre not? These videos only come from genz and millennials.
He is so adorable in his way of being. His charisma. He is so down to earth. He makes you laugh and feel relaxed around his presence.
RYAN R ... THE ONE NOTE ACTOR !!!.. 😅😂
Ryan is the Eminem of Comedy.  He can free-style jokes with little effort.  His bloopers are funnier than anything I've ever said.
I love Ryan ❤
I love him because we have the same fucked up sense of humor 🤣🤣🤣🤣💕💕
Talk shows are rehearsed and scripted. Research it. Im not making this up. They discuss the questions before hand. Plus ryan has a million reused one liners in his back pocket. From time sitting around on set etc. unlike the rest of us. Please.
Step 3 is profit.
Ya....BUT RYAN is a genius at it...flawless...never rude and WAY to Handsome.
Wonder how his and Blake’s kids will be. Making clever jokes like dad?
So where's the f@$#ng joke?
I love that man!!!
"Ryan Reynolds is very creepy no one here will believe but my family witnessed him stocking me. Without giving to much information cuz I’m still freaked out by the whole situation he tried to make me sigh a privacy forum that I’ll never speak out about it. 

Ps never sighed it 😂😂😂 point is he’s weird and creepy so now how funny do you think he is?"

"Look at him straight in the eyes like saying ""I have been waiting for this moment my entire life"" 👀🤗"
Humor is situation based like many things- variables to consider
Ìf you have to learn being funny. Better be serious.
".... I think that's just called ""improv jokes""."
"This is just being able to make light out of every situation. Many can do it. It's not so much the act of making a generic statement not so boring, but the delivery and confidence of going through with it.

It doesn't have to be the most hilariously genius joke told by man, it can be anything as long as it ties in with the context. Just need a little work on charisma to not be awkward when you try."
So basically you should use a lot of idioms?
"Guess I have scrambled eggs for brains, bc my mind goes blank constantly, so I have to half-ass my way into making my conversations work, unlike my luck with wamin LOOK AT WHAT YOUR BOY HAS BECOME, MA!

I could imagine how long it took for Ryan Reynolds to learn how to be funny. After a long time of practicing it was totally worth it.

I am an Alien as well. I think I was the original Drew Barrymore. I think she killed my kids."
"🤨 It 1st requires witt ... no, not all people can be quick, they have to Recognize Funny, before they can express a funny line!"

It’s not that deep 💀
"That's actually cool!
I cannot do it on command, making jokes, but sometimes i make even the slowest and depressed people laugh, just with a sharp joke that comes to mind.
 
So no, i can't do it on stage, but inside the house, sometimes (not on command, but also not always) i just randomly come up with a joke, and when others laugh, i always think back, and think ""That wasn't even that funny, it was just dumb humor"" ... guess dumb jokes that fit perfectly in the moment, undumbs the joke XD

Easier said than done
The Deadpool role was made for him I don't think anybody could do it better
Abi put your tounge away....
I'm glad this video loops because this whole joke is kind of hard to keep up with. I started taking notes a week or two after not sinking in and honestly that just made it more confusing. Maybe one day I'll get it. Also people keep asking why I'm talking about Ryan Reynolds' witty and absurd images he conjures up and I have to explain I'm telling a joke. Still not sure where the punchline is either.
Paid in spit amd insults. 😂
So which one of these two jokes makes me instantly likeable? The Denzel Washington one or the spits and insults?
Gain charisma by making a funny
Damn bro your stories are getting fuller they've been good all along but just noticeably improved. Keep up the great work.
You can’t fake being funny bro… It comes with life experience and wit
It's called improv. You're welcome...
Blatant Contextualization is real. Did that to my friend's cousin i and i can still remember one of them laughed so hard they pooped their pants

I've never had one of those moments because I do the same shit he does. Some people are just born that way.
I don't like people that tell mainstream jokes. You all just actors.
Luckily I am HILARIOUS at all times - in fact Ryan only bought Wrexham fc because I live near there and he literally steals my jokes
"Who knew being funny made you funny, hmm🤔"
He is a genius lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ryan Reynolds is a fucking legend.
"Two of my favorite actors, Denzel and Ryan. 🤙"
"Bet he talked his way out of discipline as a child and well probably still does,hilarious 😂😅😊"
"You said absurd, but the text on screen said obscure. Is this an AI bot channel?"
Ryan Reynolds can pay me anytime like 20 century fox
That cleared it up thanks
My mind never goes blank I seem to always have an answer or comeback
Some of us are natural smart asses
You can’t do this and have it be funny unless you’re actually intelligent. Wit is not possible to learn.
I love him❤️
Being funny is a natural thing.. you can't rehearse/ practice to be funny. People are gifted with quick wit and awesome timing
"Many of my family members including myself do this, we call it ""The Gift"". Basically just being a smartass lol"
lol I didn’t even know this was a thing I just do this a lot lol
"Thank god for this video, i have been hated by my friends for so long. This will definitely help me become much more likeable! :33333333333333333333333333333333333333333"
@Nicolas Sturniolo would be goat at this lmfo
"This is just like those damn art tutorials that be like:
Step 1: draw three circles
Step 2: add detail
And there you have it. You have recreated the Mona Lisa."
Life hack. If you want to be likable all you have to do is have people like you. Simple!
"I like this tip shown in this short video !!

My attitude is, I've learned, that if I have or have to say anything about anyone, I only speak of the good any person may have, Hmm, unless they're real pieces or shit, at least most would agree with 🤔🫣😁⚡⚡"
And that’s why Ryan fits so well to be Deadpool 🤓👍
this is the video where i realized “let’s get together now” is headspace “where we used to play.” it kinda sickens me because where we used to play is like the happiest song in my opinion and sunny remade it into something fake again. what a wild realization.
I love Ryan 😍😂
Protect this man at all costs 😂
He real tho y'all. Kool dude though. To me.
"I've found you can build this up by playing improv games with your coworkers or roommates. My work guys have a very particular kind of millennial guy humor that I'm just not very good at, but I am good at coming up with creative insults on the spot. Trading little friendly jabs has made me a lot better at being funny off the cuff. Something else that helped: I sell books for a living. Being able to quickly summarize and look at a plot in an appealing way is a big help when trying to come up with jokes."
My mind goes blank when I try to say hi to someone💀
He's  no only handsome  He's smart
bro stop hating on the god
"""This joke makes you instantly likeable. Just think of a joke.""

 Wow, profound advice."
Just face it Ryan is brilliant !!! 😊😊😊
"Paid in spit and insults, I don't get it, spit???"
I hope he dont make fun of people w cancer like his wife does
Yes I must work on my people skills.
what the fuck
"Being witty, quick with comebacks, is directly connected to a higher IQ."
I thought the thubnail was messi bruh
"Ryan Reynolds ""funny"" trait comes from his sarcasm. He has the idgaf attitude and speaks his mind."
"When confident, you can make jokes on the spot, wether they are bad or good, and still feel happy that you were the one making those jokes."
Yeah I'd never come up with those... But I do practice
Thanks for this pathetic advice to hopeless hardcore DWEEBS.
"It something we, entp's, have. But it doesn't always work, believe me 
Source : just believe my child on this one ✝︎"
I’ll listen to anything that involves Ryan Reynolds.
Pff steal Look listen men Respect the legends💎💎💎💎💎🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹make me laughing always
RYAN REYNOLDS CANT EVEN TALK PROPERLY 😂
Boots at 7:36 looks like something khanye West would wear
so handsome
162 number episode ta koi?
What joke
I tried something like this but I am so serious that ppl believe it is real.
Ryan is very self deprecating. It’s part of his charm. ❤
He Deadpool's alter ego.
This is literally his job. If you practice and do it well... then get paid the money this gut makes... you learn to it spectacularly well.
Very useful yeah yeah i get it totally possible
Uhm u dont need to practice how to be funny and just spit out stuff happens in my famiky all the time were just quick witted and humorous and stuff just immediately pops in our head and we say it 😂 and people just laugh 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣
So the solution to the moments when you wish you could think of something funny is to just think of something funny.
"""Just be witty."" That’s all folks, you can go home."
"He's funny as hell.  As a socially awkward guy who tries to be funny to counteract it, it's cool to see humor explained like this, thank you for posting.  Comedians have such a way of being their 'best worst selves' in their humor that just connects in such a human way, it's highly admirable."
lol if you’re already known to be funny most people will laugh
Why idiot's think are smart
Cross-eyed baby faced sociopaths can make a lot of money it would seem.
"I didnt get a shit from this, again what i need to do?"
Here’s an easier way. “Be British”
"lol. My son used to say get out of my room mom, once I said no why you all fighting and he looked at me that I saw an image of some kinda cartoon characters that someone threw a fire ball at me and threw me against the wall… and he starts laughing and I’m kinda like wow what did I just see and I forgot why I was there to begin with. They all made up after all.lol"

"It's basic writing: show, don't tell. Describe what you wanna say, don't just say it. It's much more impactful that way."
"So let me get this straight. When I’m in a stressful situation and my mind goes blank, turn on my Ryan Reynolds charm, confidence and humor, and paint a funny picture in the person’s mind. Seems easy!"
Plus it doesn't hurt that he's Is hot as f
I'm sick of this shit being fed to me I think I'll become Ryan Reynolds and funny my way into oblivion. Fuck YouTube and this channel for just being absolutely the wrong reason most of you even exist.
"I am not Ryan Reynolds, so I guess I’m not funny"
"I think the best thing to do is accept that you aren't always going to have a funny statement. Its probably ok to just wait until you do before making a joke. 

Also, that doesn't mean that you can't think about how something could be made into a joke if the situation is right.

Humor tends to be funnier if it feels natural as opposed to rehearsed. 

Also the fact that the point of this video is to think of something clever and witty when you're struggling to make a joke is funny by itself."
I love him he's so funny and so gorgeous
im naturually funny everyone ik says im rlly fun
I can’t stand him
"Motto in life:
Just be more self-deprecating than Eminem at the end of 8 mile."
"It comes from within, it’s not a skill"
"""its unrewarding to be generic"" so smart"
target audience: men
Will confirm does work. Like 85-95% of the time.
He's not even close to being funny.
"One i joke i often get to use is when somebody asks me ""what i'm planning on wearing?"" and i always say ""my first thought was clothes""."
I learned so much nothingness from this.
"pile 2: correct, we’re on a break."
❤😂❤
"Okay, I'll try it."
Hrs such a goofy!!!! 😅
I feel bad for the people who actually need this
Exactly 😂😂
That’s not Ryan Reynolds it’s Deadpool 😂❤
I love Ryan Reynolds he is so damn funny and just seems like a decent human being all together.
"The harder you try to be funny the less you are. You have to let it flow naturally, if you try and force it, it comes off like shit. You want good examples of forcing it watch just about any female comedian. Most are shit, amy schumer and hannah gadsby are perfect examples of it. You also have to figure out what kind of humor your best in. Not everyone will be great with all of them. You couldn't be great with political humor, ok at witty, but horrible with dry. Im pretty good with most types, especially quick witty humor, crowd work, and dry. Haven't found one im not good with, but my buddy, excellent with quick witty and political, but horrible with dry and sarcastic. Gotta find you niche is all, but remember not everyone is funny, and if you try to hard youll fail."
"Nope Dudę, either you have natural talent or not, you cant teach that to anyone"
How to get lots of comments on your page
"APART FROM ARNIE  RYAN HAS TO BE THE 
FUNNIEST ACTOR IN HOLLIWOOD ."
Sociopaths: UNITE!
"I don't think you can practice being funny, you just gotta have a mind that constantly thinks wierd, exaggerated thoughts😂"
Ryan Reynolds is AWESOME.... 😊❤
"Do you know how you can make a napkin dance?









You put a little boogie in it! 🤪"
One person to simply be themselves and tons of followers who label the method and analyse how to do it.... Ugh... Humans are pathetic!!
What bits are funny?
This is why he’s deadpool. Could you imagine anyone else doing it?
❤😂👍✌😝
When I try this People laugh & say Am built different Like How I think but I dont do it frequently cause Am an introvert
"""Replace the boring way of saying something with a funny way of saying something. Practice doing this."" Yeah, good tip. 👍"
He s cute .and funny❤
if you have to think about being funny...find another hook
Childhood trauma can make you whitty. Ryan used that to his advantage.
Habbit?
"Beware of trying to be an impromptu comedian. What you may think of as being funny is not necessarily something that someone else will find as funny, and you just might get contempt, however cleverly veiled, as the result when your tactic backfires.
This is advice from an EMPLOYER."
"If you came to the comments first, save 55 seconds of your life and swipe to the next short. You're welcome..."
So what you're saying is.. mimic Ryan's comedic genius. Gotcha.
"It takes super intelligence to be funny and on point, on the spot"
"Those audience laughs are fake. They hold up signs telling the audience to laugh at this hack bs. If you want to learn to be funny, listen to Patrice O’Neil"
what did you just discover comedy and one of its many aspects yesterday? what most people dont realize is comedy is the ability to control minds in mass
"It's mostly a natural talent, I'm great at that sort of humour... But I'm bad at socialising, so I only joke with my wife and daughters – who have the same sense of humour, and I love it."
This was dumb
"People would laugh at anything he says  because he’s a famous actor.
Everyone knows he gets paid millions for movie, it’s the middle class that gets paid in spit and insults."
"He's always been a great actor, funny, beautiful family. ❤❤❤"
Huh?  Most lame advice ever.
Memorize
I'm convinced he improv'ed most of his Deadpool lines because he doesn't seem any different than himself in those movies.
"This video is pretty stupid it's his profession to be charismatic 😮😮😮 it's like saying look at how that boxer punches it's 2nd nature to him, well yeah, he been practicing since he was 2 years old."

literally zero humor im a video about humor
You either have it or you don’t you can’t learn something that is that skilled
This is such a gay self help video my bisexuality has just become full blown aids

"""I think the team that scores the most points has a good shot at winning the game."""

Angel say yes like watch about movies and marvel and friends guys and angel say yes cool and nice and very funny for movies and angel say yes like guys is very good 👍👌😁💪 and angel say hi to guys and angel say about angel is deaf and cool for angel say yes tell guys😇👋
"Do you wish you could think of funny stuff to say but your mind goes blank?? Heres a trick you can steal from ryan:  Basically when you want to make someone laugh, try to think of something funny"
"Commentators are better at humor here, than author and that guy from the video :)"
"That’s easy. All you have to do is read, “Snappy Answers To Stupid Questions and “More Snappy Answers To Stupid Questions.” When you were 13 years old and you’re in! That’s what I did!"
Ryan is just a genius
"Your captions say ""Conjure up an obscure image"" but the person reading clearly says ""an ABSURD image"", which also makes more sense."
Intelligent people are good storytellers and are funny because they have a lot to draw from.
"My advice on how to be likeable:

Just be yourself. You can draw inspiration from other people. But your way of things has to be your own in the end. Even if it's your own take on other people's methods. If you're to take notes from other people, utilize them in a way that works for you."
❤ ❤❤❤ DRAKO M.K
😂
Why is this clip so popular? How much money did this YouTube fella have to pay for this crappy clip to get so many views?
Duh
"Wanna be funny and likeable, just be Ryan Reynolds. K thxz, bai."
I can do that in Spanish but in english its more difficult
Don't you love being educated about humor by an unfunny nerd?
Meh
this is why Ryan is the perfect man to play Deadpool
How to be funny: turn your light bulb on
"He's super keen on being funny, he hits every note on the note. 👏 #legendary"
😐
Quit with criminal and take up legal
00:41
This is why he’s Deadpool
"Um, way to show the unachievable as an example lol"
I but Ryan Reynolds doesn't. My friend Tommy Brown was like that. Quickest wit
😂
Who doesn’t love Ryan? Loved his babysitting Superbowl gig bahaha
I try to act like like Dirty Harry;  many observe images 🎉
Ryan Reynolds 💪👊🫡👑💯
You can't learn how to be funny after pubity
Wit is inate. It can't be practiced until you get it right. Just like any other comedic timing.
He is the Hollywood version of Chael Sonnen
Never can beat a good sense of humor
"Best way to make a joke, is to call someone an A-Hole... Then laugh hysterically....It works all the time,no corny jokes needed!"
"14:35
“We live in a nice neighborhood, this is 2024”
Oh yeah of course sorry ma’am when you put it that way of course you’re right my bad"
What a waste of time this video was
LoL...Mint Mobile isnt funnÿ at all
I believe he's just naturally hilarious 😅
Cute as. Ryan.
Tried this and now no girl wants to talk to me bc I don’t look like Ryan Reynolds’s
I thought it said this joke would make me instantly unlikeable D:
Twenty seven million views for this bullshit. What the fuck
this vid made me come up with my corny jokes at all
"""Короевская двойня""
Надо бы отметить бутылочкой ""Короны""!😂"
What a dumb video.
It is not in everybody's personality to be spontaneously witty. Some people's minds don't work that way. It's not how they think.
"""We've all had those moments where we wanted to say something funny, but we couldn't think of something funny.""

""The solution is to think of something funny."""
"Thanks I will use that ""tearing down my Denzel poster"" joke often I'm sure"
Still one of my fave actors
"It works just for stars and actors , because for me people just say they don't understand"
"How to be funny: have the audience prompter say ""LAUGH"""
Love this man!
Never seen anything more cringe than jake paul coming out to everyday bro. Jake paul wasnt even my favorite person in his home
A condifent person belittling themselves makes people who lack confidence feel safe and relatble to them as well as the average person can laugh at it. It also shows you have humility because you can be 6ft tall and attractive but still think less of yourself and that makes you instantly more attractive than someone narcissistic and full of themselves. It also shows intelligence as you are able to understand human emotions and imagination so you are able to correctly put a picture in the headsof others to understand your perspective.
He’s Canadian. Of course he is funny. Some of the best comedians are Canadian! ❤🇨🇦
underrated i subbed also do u have a discord?
"It's just his personality and his natural response to be witty like that.
Jim Carrey had his kind of personality with a different kind of wit and Robin Williams had his."
"You gotta practice this? Well shit, lemme take some notes, then"
"The Denzel comment wasn't even funny, American audiences are just drones."
"I am funny like this, but i only became funny after 6 years of depression. Before that. No one smiled around me 😎"
Some people are just funny that is it. Plus funny people take the piss out of themselves
"To be fair, it's not hard being an actor during an interview.
Before going into the interview, you can foretell about 90% of the boring crap they're going to ask you and you can think of what to say during any moment of your morning.
Try this: Instead of cycling on the past with your shower thoughts, think of a person you know you're going to see and then think of what you can say to make them laugh today."
Lol these comments are hilarious but this is an on point way to describe what he is doing I love it
He is pretty amazing and brilliant!
Jim Carey is the 🐐 because he can encapsulate slapstick and verbal
A little humility is good for the soul.
"Intelligent people don't ""try"" to make people ""like"" them 🫥. Intelligent people don't live to please other's, they're smart enough to just live 

their lives and let all chips in life fall where they may. This video is nothing but bluepill social-engineering 🫥👎."
"Self deprecating humour. If you in some way insult yourself but its lighthearted and not serious, its easier to be likeable."
A very dumb short that didn't actually make a point.
"Yes 
Thank You 😊🪷🐺🪷"
This is cool high value post
"I've talked this way my whole life. It's just..... say what a thing is. Shit, none of that is absurd, metaphorical or imaginary at all."
Having natural wit is one thing.  But is not impossible to develop wit as well.  Ryan seems to be a natural.
im not gay but id consider ryan reynolds
The spits and insults took me out😂😂
Fr....or you're just donating laughs
Why isn't Ryan aging?
"If i talked to people, id have this down."
From certain angles ryan looks like Chris watts
Dumb video
Ryan's got a great sense of humor 🤣
"""This joke makes you instantly likable""
Proceeds to tell me to make up a joke"
Blah blah blah
Ryan Reynolds is a comedian that's not a comedian.
Ryan Reynolds is one of my favorites…he’s so naturally funny and quick witted.
Makes him more smashable
Hes never once made me laugh. Hes a complete fugazi.
And this is why he's perfect as Deadpool
Nothing witty in these examples.
🗣️Nora!!!  Why!!!!🤣😂😫😩😫
Good advice actually
I don't have to do faces. I do faces even if I don't do faces. My wife reads every thought of mine spot on. I don't even have to say anything. 🤡
I loveeeee Ryan n his witty beautiful a—!
This video deserves 100 million down votes
"Thanks, but I'll just be myself."
"STEVEN ""AQUAMAN"" ADAMS"
But Ryan isn't funny...so how does that work
If youre funny youre funny this video does nothing to help someone that isnt funny.  Im nominating this video as the most worthless video of 2024. And i literally recently learned about a video where a kid stares at a freshly painted fence drying for 5 hours.
Social skills on fleek
Reynolds blows dogs for quarters. Lol
"This was funnier than anything he said in the video, wow method works."
"Yeah and those jokes won't work if you're not as attracticve as ryan reynolds. He can use self-deprecating jokes because he's a fucking handsome man, like nobody, if you're average joe reaction that you would get is closer to like ""aww, feels bad being you""."
In those tense situations I always forget my humorous interactions with Denzel and my bs pay at Fox
"To be funny, """" DO A DENZEL WASHINGTON MOVIE """""
Two words: quick wit
"I start all my conversations with “Hi, I’m a landlord who just wants to raise peoples rent as much as possible and see the constable in action” 

People love that $h|t"
Still waiting for the joke.
"Guys. Hes just explaining his style so you can take inspiration. 
The way ryan makes it funny is by explaining his emotions through a scene
Like instead of saying ""i got a bad grade haha"" you say. ""So i the teacher passes me the exam, mind you im SWEATING BULLETS. i flip it over- and i open... And BAM. Zero. My first thought wasn't 'oh no i wasted my time"" it was 'OH SHIT MOM!'""
(Ik its not funny but as an example)"
How to be charismatic: have charisma
This was so pointless. 😂😂😂
Please dont make it sexual or it will have the opposite effect. Please. Anyone worth being around you will disgust 98% of the time.
"Ryan’s the king  of  on the spot unscripted humor. I don’t understand how it comes to him so easily. His facial expressions, tone of voice, everything."
"Im really , really good, at these quick one liners ..

A Full 2 days later ...... when im in the shower ,while  scrubbing my balls."
That's why not anyone can be Ryan Reynolds
"Loved that movie they did together - ""Safe house"" filmed in my home city of Cape Town ❤️ 💙"
I swear this channel is for psychopaths to learn how to act normal xD
He's just annoying
I always prefer my humour to be witty...
"Bringing attention to everyday things, but with a twist really puts people on the spot lol. Like with the Poster? Some people will have that poster growing up and admire him, but Ryan using it like he did really makes people look at there lives more dynamically. Like, shit, I really wanted to F*CK denzel in High School... Now I got a wife and kids, sooooo much for that plan huh?"
"When I want to say something witty and funny but my mind goes blank, I just need to say something witty and funny. Got it."
"most useless video i've ever watched, you should be banned for brainrot"
I used to be funny.  Even when I married my second wife she used to say that we were always thinking a like and that my sense of humor cracked her up .  But then as her narcissism came out and the abuse started it just went away ..
So basically just speak in tumblr
He should have played sm64.z64. That hack is genuinely unnerving.
"Celebrities!!! Question? HAVE ANY ONE EVER STOPPED ONE FROM BEING WITH ANOTHER!?? DOES OPINIONS OF OTHERS HAVE AN IMPACT ON LIFE, LIVING OR LIFE STYLE?"
"Quick wit, it's a gift"
Cringe
What you said makes absolutely no sense whatsoever...I could go into the whole Billy Madison bit where we're all dumber for listening but I won't...
You either have it or you don't. No inbetween
"Now I understand why he advertises Aviator Gin so much, it's the only way he can get paid a liveable wage."
Are there really people practicing to be funny like Ryan Reynolds? And you’re encouraging this? Take a step back and think about how sad that is.
I mean I guess… in my RDC world voice 😂😂
Ah very helpful.
Ryan is genuinely a funny guy
"Yea, he's a smart guy and can pull it off with ease.  I try this and it's 50/50 with me.  Somehow my mind pulls out a pit beef jab and I'm reminded that if I'm not talking to people from MD, no one gets the reference which is increasingly odd because I've never even been there.  I think I heard it in a movie at some point."
"""Think quickly on the spot""
Nah bro I don't think, I just say the first dumb shit that pops in my head and it works."
Ryan Reynolds energy FTW
"This is why people say I'm funny, cuz my mind creates nothing but absurd images"
The green lantern movie wasn't that good.
"It's his idiolect, and through practice this can become your own habit as well, you just need to think before you speak"

"My top priority in life is to maintain and cultivate my inner peace. I achieve this goal daily and consistently by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle. I honor my commitment to inner peace each day. Through mindful choices and loving routines, I nurture my body, mind, and spirit. I am grateful for the harmony I create in my life. Achieving daily health goals is essential for inner peace and happiness, consistently nurturing a sense of well-being. If your goals are health-related, reaching them daily is key to cultivating inner peace and happiness. If you want a deep level of inner peace and a strong sense of happiness consistently in your life, this is essential. Just as a tree roots itself deep in the ground while reaching for the sky, I ground myself in daily practices that nourish my inner self."
Useful info. Thank-you.
Thanks Tony! Appreciate your help and support. 🤝

This mfer: lemme just answer the question without ACTUALLY ANSWERING the question…
"Good Stuff except our Brains are only like 6,000 years old"
Happiness is a combination of choice and circumstances yes u can chose to be happy but if your circumstances are shitty that won't be enough to make you happy and if you chose to be miserable there is no happy circumstances so both choice and circumstances have to match and stay match enough for happiness to be so.
"Part of this issue as well is we live so much longer that has nothing to do with evolution, it is technology. I would argue in the relative short time we have doubled our lifespan that our brains have yet to evolve to accommodate this length of life. It simply does not know what to do with itself with this long lifespan."
"Me makes it happier if i watch this sort of videos because then i know how i can get happy and i am happy about that because my brain is very much thinking how can i survive but when i watch this then this reminds me that i want to be happy, thank you Tony 🙌❤"

"My mind is literally blown right now. I am a writer who studies neuroscience religiously and Tony is almost word for wording a segment of one of the chapters I was writing yesterday in the book I am currently working on.  Love it!🥰

"Poor saber tooth tigers... still getting a bad rap 🤣

On Relationship Day/Day 2 you/Mr. Robbins talked about the importance of using S.E.W.  to have authentic relationships. What if you have literally NEVER had (54+ years and counting) an authentic relationship due to familial child sex trafficking that absolutely no one has acknowledged or done anything at all to help you to heal from—directly.

Keep educating us humans Tony. We love you!
I taught my granddaughter from birth that life can be want you want and you can be happy and she is a happy go lucky kid that knows about the bad things in life but doesn’t focus on that but focuses on being happy and manifesting whatever she wants in this life
"Tony’s point about happiness being a choice is so true. It's easy to forget, but taking control of how we react to life’s challenges makes all the difference. Simple yet powerful!"
Thank you sir tony fir always there for me and your family god bless

Haha 😄
go on...
How can i wake up
We don't need to go to evolution to explain humans. Creationism could just as easily explain us.
Laurel Mellin emotional brain training and 12 step programs are the how to do that in my life.

I have the choice to be happy no matter what is going on around me ❤❤ That was such a beautiful realization ❤❤
I dont want to push good people away being negative and sad. But i struggle being postive about life..
Uncle Robbins
The only way to change your life is to change your beliefs. That means you have to change at least half of your beliefs. More than fifty percent of them. Rewire your brain.
"Until you turn to Jesus you will never know true happiness, just temporary distractions on your self-made path to destruction. I love you all, look into Jesus’s life, give him a chance"

You know exactly what we have now which is destroying human brains.  Have you seen the uk 😂😂

"I’m happy and I’m learning to love myself everyday and to heal from within and to heal my mind 
Spirituality is something I’ve recently starting exploring and I’m very keen to learn about it and to adopt it in my life too 
Life can be challenging sometimes but we are humans we are meant to live happily we are meant to control our Brian’s not the other way around 
The point I’m in rn I won’t say I’m the happiest and it’s challenging to say the least but I’m trying everyday to get out of this situation 
To get back in my happy space my happy zone 
It’s a process we have to trust the process and it takes time
So one time a day .Just trust the process. 🧿 God is with everyone and God is great 🤗"

"Our brains are conniving 💩 bags that trick us into thinking whatever “it” (🧠) wants us to think, that is why we stress out over things that have no bearing over the stuff that really matters, it tries to control our thoughts and in turn our emotions and subsequently our actions in order to remain “in charge”. Well I say “screw” that, I’m the boss here, not some extremely complex neuron loaded fat mass!"

An evil mind is deceitful, but gentle thoughts bring happiness.

I’ve found this Bible verse the more gentle I am the more peaceful I become allowing me to to happy!"

Tony I love you you’re teaching me/us since 1986 when you dropped Unlimited Power thank you for your help and support my brother
Great eye opening information 🙄☺
"💯I talk about this often now. I was stuck and still sometimes catch myself in the hustle but now it’s about moving in joy. Happiness, joy, creation. It’s all a choice but how do you do that when your brain continues to pull you to what’s not right? Well it takes practice but like Tony said, wake up and choose…choose to smile, breathe, thank God, and keep reminding yourself until it’s a habit. 🫶🏽✨

You’ve got this!! 💪🏽"
what really makes me happy is that I am part of nature and god. And no corrupt business decides about the crucial things in life.
Lions still exist
Your job is to make yourself happy
I need more Tony's training
This is my favorite opened my eyes survival
❤🙏💖
Excellent my friend 🙂‍↔️
"“Your job is to create happiness”. 
What do we use to create the happiness? Guess!! Our brain. These “gurus” talk some nonsense to keep themselves rich and relevant. 
Happiness is fleeting. You will never ever ever be happy all the time. A simpler exercise is to write down on a piece of paper 10 things that have ever made you really smile and happy. Whittle your list down to the top 3. Meditate on those 3 things: and then practice them daily. Actively take action and consciously push yourself to practice those 3 things daily like you would a piano or guitar or anything to get better at it. 
I wish you many happy days. But please note that they will never all be happy. Cest la vie."
Love Tony ❤️
"Yes, well said!"
Thank you Tony for this helpful video message! 🐸
"I have not felt happy for a long while. A lot has happened honestly. I lost both of my parents (my mother when I was in my 20’s, and my father 3 years ago). I studied piano performance, completed a master’s degree, but work at a call center from home full time. I feel lost. I haven’t touched piano for a while now because of lack of time. I applied to work at a high school or elementary school as a piano teacher (I also taught piano), but I never got a response. My CV is not impressive enough, I chose a lot of ‘bad’ phone jobs because I had no other choice. I’m trying to find some happiness in this lifetime. 😢"
"You may want to get certified as a music teacher so you can work in public education... go to your state's education website for information on certification requirements, and DONT GIVE UP!  Figuring life and things out often takes time. Trust God, and many blessings to you moving forward."
@ ❤️
Let me guess ...you are going to teach us how to be happy as long as we pay for your courses...
🌸💕🌸
Well said 🐾
"The only way to true happiness and fulfillment in this life is through Our Lord JesuChrist in His Church.🙏🏻

Such a medical leader
"At a group session, a new guys turn to speak.  He said he really didn’t even understand the concept. 

I could feel his truth. Never a happy moment . But Tony ? lol. Not me"
That's a long time ago that I got a piece of such valuable information. Think you mister!
"The sabertooth tiger is now your boss, that coworker you dont like, the government, your parents etc...."
I taught my daughter to be happy. Public school tried to force it out of her

"Indeed our Brains are possibly naturally survival based whoever Society  has been  conditioning and habituating people to Fear based Brains since centuries and still today with massive medias/  politics  manipulations. It is a Must that we TRAIN individually every day to rewire our habituated brain to create our own happiness. Creating  our own morning / evening  routines and tap into Gratefulness, exercising, connecting with nature. Not watching the news. Taking ownership for ourselves. This is how we will change this 🌎. 1by 1💕"
I lost everything how can I be happy?
Be happy ❤🎉and all will be just great😊
"Great topic, took me decades to know how important being Happy and having JOY is! I had numerous suicide attempts until I found the POWER of JOY :-)"
Thank you for staying strong all this time ❤️
Please share how you did it and what you did!!! I need to hear the how and what!
This guy gives me the creeps. Something in his eyes . Seem lifeless. Why does he always talk so fast and with such intensity.? He's gonna have a heart attack someday. Where did he come up with 2 million years.
Does anyone know what or where the full video is?
Well said Tony
i’m not meant to be happy
Really like the guy. Loving the 'scruffy beard' look.
How does anyone listen to you anymore? You lost the ability to add. Your math is constantly wrong.
"Non believers say Billions of years,  believers say thousands ! …."
"Oo children know how to be happy but the upbringing from parents and surrounding are limiting them. Sure,Kids need regulation and direction,but if growing up under pressure , they will become stressed adults under survival mode all the time"
"I think the saber tooth tiger evolved to lack of family ideals, no respect and aggressive people that arent willing to communicate and work things out. The good news is we can leave those situations or people the best we can by literally leaving, socially withdrawing or minimizing time spent. The bad news is it's a different type of loneliness but to keep it in perspective its not like it wasnt lonely way back when its that because we're surrounded by so many people and have less quality time with a few people we're always adapting to largely different ways of communicating so often with the need to withdraw that its hard to communicate anything at that point. Good news again is we have a lot more self knowledge to work with with understanding mental health and its way more comfortable nowadays with our technology. My question becomes is it better to gain self knowledge and comfortability or gain the trust of another person or small group of people with greater tragedies like another tribe stealing and killing your tribe"
Yes! But how can I hear the rest of this message?
"Thought how to be happy???? 
So you’ll teach people to be happy and they will have the same pleasure and life what you’re creating on paper???? 
Who is buying this???"
somad
Happiness is how easy things are unhappiness is how hard things are
OMG YES
English isn't my first language. What does it mean to not be on auto-pilot?
"HOW TO BE HAPPY:
1. WAKE UP
2. SLAM ENERGY DRINK
3. WORK FOR 8 HRS"
Good teaching toney God bless you xo
😮
Seen this guy in Sydney maybe 92 93 ? Alot of celebs alot of hype but some good stuff. In 2015 writing steps in AA I realised 75% of that 2 day seminar is AA step work.
Every day is a good day for Tony Robbins when he's able to hustle someone out of their money.
Do you know how much he gives to others? It's amazing!
"Free sh!t on YT, and his books are at public libraries"
Happiness only comes from above through jesus christ you won't find it without him .earthy happiness is like Christmas light won't last long. Come TO Jesus repent
Happiness comes from helpfulness.... maybe Tony is a primitive man... but not everyone is like that... all people are not created equal...
This needs a part 2. How do people get off automatic pilot. How do people get happy xx
Nonsense and delusional
"If your brain is about 2 million years old then you should be ultimate wisdom
Not sure if it agrees with Genesis"
Two million year old brain discovered in living human being....
"If you become a trillionaire and achieve every metric of success, that is not even a fraction of 1% of the joy and peace that you get from feeling the love of Jesus, your heavenly father✝️"
"Brain producing serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine like:👁👄👁"
"Med it Tate !!! 
No One is thinking about You Anyway!! lol  so give them something to Think About n Show Up for Yourself Every Day🎉🎉"
Today there are things more worse than the saber tooth tiger that have been created by humans……that is why suicide is on the rise along with mental health problem
"We are victors not victims of our past. 
My TED talk https://youtu.be/c3VJiLXSK-U?si=hnxODk7xN7aWd7Z3"
Financial freedom is a big plus especially someone like Tony Robbins who is worth many millions of dollars that’s why i don’t understand why he still charges people so much money to attend his seminars. There comes a point when you should be giving back but when someone who is charging the money he’s charging that ain’t giving back.
Tony....You seem like someone I can listen too!👍. Ha & we are both (Tony's) Tony Ball Guitarist UK
Is there a full version of it?
I Love you
"The problem is, there is no saber tooth tiger anymore?"
stop being on auto pilot? that's all I got to do thanks..  terrible advice
"My one goal in life was to automate myself and I thought that would make life easier, therefore happier. I think you just changed my life (hopefully)"
"You’re right, I respect everything you said thanks"
"For sure, getting eatin by an animal is definitely the same as a digital insult🙄🙄"
I been on pilot mode for years
No we are not  million years old  mind. We are made in the image of God. Fear comes from not having faith
So how does one learn to be happy? 🤷🏻‍♀️😳🥺
You are our Jesus of 21st century
Bologna! Actually study theory of evolution & any nominally intelligent person will see the science does not support it.
Our brains are not two million years old
Love you Tony!!!❤❤❤ 🎉
Awesome that’s all I have to say !!!!❤❤❤❤
"You'll never be able to find peace in this world, only temporary solutions. Jesus says ""I am the way, the truth and the life, no-one  comes to the father but through me."" Do not turn to other methods of trying to feel peace, nothing will work, turn to Jesus Christ today and believe the gospel so that you can be saved. This life cannot give you the peace and happiness that you are searching for, only God can give you that. Therefore choose this day who you will serve for tommorow is never promised to anyone. God bless you"
Evolution is bs and only an unproven theory. I agree with the learning to be happy part.
Evolution is falsenews
Good talk my dude much appreciated my man we need more like you big bro its crazy out here being along you know
Thank you
"Yes, happy where you are ❤"
We are born happy look at kids LOL
"Help me please! Bad school memories are always in my mind!!! Whenever I want to be happy, this is in my mind... my mind is full of these thoughts, I feel like I am losing my creativity, please help!"
❤❤❤❤
I feel like I’m always angry all the time and I hate it I need To make change I keep saying that too but it never happens I’m trying to meditate as well
"These shorts are wonderfull,  I look forward to them now. Thank you for being a positive in a sea of negatively!!!"
Praise to God jesus christ and I thanks to God and you my great Father international pastor Father Tony ROBBIN. Amen
EXCELENT
"This is not your best effort just shows you read some book about the ancient brain big deal. The more proof information you have on the psychologist state is much better anyway that’s my two cents. Have a good day and I like you a lot and I listen to a lot of stuff. This one doesn’t do anything for me, it doesn’t seem like your hearts really in this one either…
Not hateful just a friend that feels the need to reflect truth ; accurate mirror…"
You have to learn how to be happy! The higher mental faculties will give you break through on how to create a richer fuller life.
"I'm wanting to relocate but I'm so scared - scared of something going wrong and ending up homeless.  But I can't stand the thought of staying here.  My landlady offered to rent me an apartment much closer to the city so now I been at a crossroads.  If I move to her apt, I'll still be miserable."
"Sounds like you've made your decision.😊 BUT don't move without doing your research FIRST...preparation helps to reduce fears. Trust God, and many blessings to you moving forward."

"@TonyRobbinsLive Thank you for this message today. Putting this concept into practie is what saved and changed my life. In one of Tony's courses, I learned how to create happiness and it has shifted how I live every day and it impacts those around me. 🙏❤️🔆"
Thanks for sharing and which course is it
​ @GrowingGreatly Tony teaches that concept in his Unleash the Power Within course. He is doing a 3-day live summit this week for free and you can get a glimpse into his work. It's called the Time to Rise Summit.
Love each other make us happy.😁😂pray to God that make us happy in this journey.he really know what makes us real happy.because he know us better than our selfs.
Thank you amen
Bless you

"There is no life/work balance as some things life evens may require more attention then others. Also, your prior siblings did more hard work to shape  your path."
"I don’t agree, as a yoga master, personal trainer and energy medicine practitioner. 

If you don’t believe that you can have work / life balance, then you won’t!

With a disability I have personally achieved work / life balance and that’s why I am qualified to help others achieve it!

It’s not easy, doesn’t happen overnight, but the fact is that the work is worth it. 

The alternative is a distressing life! 

I am BTW the eldest sibling of only two, and nearly 60! 

I know a thing or two about lifestyle choices and how to apply them for myself & others! 

Current client is a retired truck driver who never exercised a day in his life & wants to lose weight!"
"@ReneeKnightYogaRani  from a general standpoint, generally speaking work life balance is a myth specially in usa. Your previous offsprings paved the way for you to have that yoga balance."
... Lucky you?
" @teamginger6359  yes, particularly since it’s a small business that requires a lot of integrity!"
"​ @edwardlee3533 You're so right, like WTF 😮"
" clydenolet736 it’s easy to feel really good when you’re get out every weekend & have some fun, dancing & whatnot on the weekend! It’s a choice! In order to get to a place where you can do that you have to have some good discipline."
Ouch
that's because you have financial privilege! enjoy it
The modern saber tooth tigers are the automobile & the gun.
"This man truly changed my life. If you get a chance to do his Unleash The Power Within seminar, take it! Life will never be the same…"
How were you different prior to the seminar. I need a total reset
​@vickimarsh1260  I'm listening to it now. It's the real deal. Basically it resets the way you think. Your happiness and ability to focus on what you want is all controlled by how you think. I have never listened to anything that help me change the way I think this much besides the Bible. It's worth it. Its real psychology that works fast. Literally changing my life. Help you focus on the good versus pain/suffering that's hindering what you want. I've been more happy since day one of listening. (I also naturally use to overthink because of intelligence). I even understand why I'm happy if I chose to go down that route and get out of it quickly.
" @vickimarsh1260  it’s hard to put into words but if you’re serious about leveling up, I recommend it. I’ve done it 3 times"
Just saw your reply. Thank you.  At the time of your reply what  are you listening to please?
Right✌🏼✌🏼
Yep let go and enjoy the ride!
"Children are innately happy, they are taught to think about survival"
"That’s because children are unburdened by reality. In most cases, everything for a child is provided by an adult."
Excellent.
No me sirve si no es en español
Soooooo true!!!
Thanks Tony for tik tok advice
Thank you for this Tony!
survival is difficult with scarce food and housing:therefore happiness is difficult to achieve with large populations like those found in california:example san diego finds it difficult to feed all seamen in its city:-prabhudata
Thank🙏💕
"AMEN!!! Took me 35 years, 2 Army Contract & 6 years of college TO FIGURE THIS OUT FOR MYSELF!!! Young People, PAY ATTENTION!…This Stuff Is GOLD & Will SAVE YOU!!!! 🙏💞🇺🇸"
Good reminder for my birthday today❤ THANK YOU
" @-barorian9828  
Happy Birthday!"
Love Tony! ❤
Careful teaching lies of evolution Tony. Thought you said you are a Christian..
" @theo49476  I could read a philosophy book in school but I still had a teacher to explain it to me. I haven't been to theology school so I still need help understanding some things. It was written in a different culture at a very different time period so no, it's not so easy as just read it and understand every part. That's why there are so many denominations and skeptics. Cause it's not easy."
"So exhausted of just surviving everyday….. 
Im choosing to live happily, joyfully, successfully & faithfully🙏"
I'm with you ❤
Same
But how can we do that?
Mi mentor y fuente de inspiración para iniciar a ayudar a otros ❤❤
"Claro que si , de eso se trata la vida, de ser estudiantes con el propósito de llegar a ser maestros,, sharing is caring, 👍🏿"
"You are forever awesome, Tony."
Parenting a frequently sick adult child requires such reminders to loosen my hyper vigilance!
"Hello there, If you wanna get more information , dm me for guidelines"
I hope things have gotten better for you!
“We’re not taught how to be happy” 😮😢😊❤ that’s not good
❤
April 24 th is my birthday  ! Join me at “livin “”
"Lol. If you said all these words in a whisper I could hear you. You're great the way you are. You appeal to many many millions. I just wish I could hear you, and I  can't hear you when you holler like that. Anyway go go mister Go Big. Thanks for your big heart and enormous generosity."
Maybe his messages would be easier for you to ingest on mute with closed captioning. The message is important.
Tony the HUNGRY Tiger. In Joy Your Life. Joy is not the ends: but the means. Time to transcend the archaic and carnal. And build the temple for the devine.
Awesome Mr Robbins Thanks 😊
Thank you for the motivation and direction. Always!
Full video where? Thanks
Best video! 👏
Wishing you true happiness and joy Tony!
"WOW, very thoughtful"
"He literally is one of Gods gifts to us. Well we all are, but Tony especially 😂"
"YES, there is still the Saber Tooth Tiger, called the IRS. Lol. I love you Tony Robbins. What an awesome and amazing person you are. You have saved millions of lives, positively. Bo K.S. Uce, JD"
Omg! The irs and my bank account are both Saber tooth tigers oh and the check engine light survival mode vs joy😮

"Kalimimi në energji të pastër është një qëllim ambicioz dhe i nevojshëm për të ruajtur mjedisin dhe për të siguruar një të ardhme të qëndrueshme. Megjithatë, ka disa sfida kryesore që duhet të kapërcehen për të realizuar këtë kalim:

Kostot e fillimit: Investimet fillestare për energjinë e pastër, si instalimi i paneleve diellore, turbinave të erës ose sistemeve hidroelektrike, shpesh janë të larta. Kjo mund të përbëjë një pengesë për shumë shtete dhe individë, veçanërisht ata që kanë buxhete të kufizuara.

Rrjetet dhe infrastrukturat e vjetra: Shumë shtete kanë sisteme të energjisë elektrike që janë të dizajnuara për të mbështetur burime tradicionale (si nafta dhe gazi), dhe ato nuk janë gjithmonë të përshtatshme për të integruar energjinë e rinovueshme. Kjo kërkon investime të mëdha në modernizimin e infrastrukturës.

Ruajtja dhe menaxhimi i energjisë: Energjitë e pastra si ajo diellore dhe e erës janë të varura nga kushtet atmosferike dhe shpesh janë të papërshtatshme për t’u përdorur në mënyrë të qëndrueshme pa teknologji ruajtjeje të energjisë (si akumulatorët). Ky problem kërkon zhvillimin e mundësive për ruajtjen dhe menaxhimin e energjisë.

Varësia nga burimet tradicionale: Shumë ekonomi të zhvilluara dhe në zhvillim janë ende shumë të varura nga burimet tradicionale të energjisë, si nafta dhe gazi, për energjinë dhe transportin. Kalimi në energji të pastër mund të sjellë sfida ekonomike dhe sociale, sidomos për industrinë dhe vendet që janë të lidhura ngushtë me këto burime.

Politika dhe regulloret: Politikat dhe rregulloret në shumë shtete mund të ngadalësojnë kalimin në energji të pastër. Ndërsa disa qeveri e mbështesin kalimin, të tjerat mund të përballen me presion nga lobi i industrisë së naftës dhe gazit ose të mos kenë mjaftueshëm angazhim për të bërë ndryshimet e nevojshme ligjore dhe politike.

Mungesa e edukatës dhe ndërgjegjësimit: Pjesa e madhe e popullsisë nuk është ende e vetëdijshme për përfitimet afatgjata të energjisë së pastër dhe për sfidat që paraqet energjia tradicionale. Edukimi dhe ngritja e ndërgjegjësimit për të përdorur burime më të pastra energjie është një sfidë tjetër.

Përmbushja e kërkesës globale për energji: Me rritjen e popullsisë globale dhe rritjen e kërkesës për energji, është e vështirë të përmbushen nevojat energjetike vetëm nga burimet e rinovueshme. Përveç kësaj, kërkesa për energji shpesh nuk është uniforme dhe kërkon fleksibilitet në furnizimin e energjisë, që është një sfidë e madhe për burimet e pastra.

Për të kapërcyer këto sfida, është e nevojshme që të punojmë për zhvillimin e teknologjive të reja, të investojmë në kërkimin dhe zhvillimin e burimeve të rinovueshme dhe të krijojmë politika dhe infrastrukturë që mbështesin kalimin në energji të pastër."

Stop romanticising the devil

"Insta is full of these comments 
But this channel....
What was the need to highlight it and more n more insult the lady!??
Disgusting 😑"
The beauty they see in her is the reflection of them . Hope they understand
"Why do we always forget the fact that its everyone's right to live in this world?..... it's their life whatever they wanna do ,whoever they wanna marry?? Why do we wanna give an opinion on everything?? Its her choice whether she wanna lose weight....
And to all those saying ""she's so fat""
Dude she doesn't cares about you...go find a job...
Hope they live a beautiful life together...."
They don't need a bed to do it because SHE IS THE BED!
the fact we have normalized this shit shows how messed up ppl are
Ok that is actually just cruel let these people love their happy lives but noooo these mfs clearly don't like to see a happy ending so they go on to say bullshit
"I know comments were a bit funny that's why they got do much likes but we already learnt that it's not funny when it is caused by making someone fun , it's not her fault 
Hope people act a bit of mature person , i don't know that they'rr more immature people then me 😑"
"U feel bad she doesn’t deserve that bc she’s over weight I know they are just jokes but some jokes aren’t nice 😢

I’ve been body shamed before I understand what it’s like so it’s not fair for her just let her live her life guys."
They look so happy though these people need to get lives. This is not funny in any way
Second comment 😂😂😂😂😂
we are normalizing cyber bullying..
People who comment like that on insta think that it made them cool or sigma but nah it shows us why hell is empty
"O l
This is them"
That is one MASSIVE dream
"""She attracted him by her gravitational field"" IS CRAZY.😭🙏🏻"
I know right😭
That bad really she deserves respect ❤
The comments section here on yt is the reason i decided to move to YT
"This aint funny at all, yall are just ruining their happiness. Go touch grass and get a fucking life instead of hating on people who have done nothing to you"
They be so damn creative 😭🤦🏽‍♀️
Husband is the beauty Wife is the beast 💀

GRAVITATIONAL FIELD LMAAAOOOO
You're not cool if you are making such jokes.

YouTube pe bhi Instagram 💀
Our generation is screwed.
When I saw it said instagram reels I knew it was gonna be bad.
"WOAH PEOPLE THINK IT'S COOL🙏
CRITICISM <HATE..."
If skinny shaming is normal then fat shaming is too
Ya instagram everyone is going to roast you no matter what even if you are the perfect human being people will roast you there . Don’t take anything personal ❤ you are beautiful inside out
holy fuck was that caseohs daughter
thats i delete Instagram 🤡
Please be kind to everyone 🙏🙏
Wild? DARK Humor? cool huh 🤔 making someone feel ugly is cool? Writing nasty shit about a couple is cool? Okay 👍🏽
Exact reason I uninstalled Instagram
"""bro has his own planet"" 
THAT'S A CRAZY SHI-"
Bullying is not cool.
"They can only say those things when feeling secured behind a screen. Make them stand in front of the person and they'll not even breathe loudly.
People tend to feel safe and better when they are humiliating a person through internet. But when you make them stand in front of the person, they won't say the same things cuz they know that they will be the one getting humiliated."
Peoples mindset 🤮
One of the many reasons I left Instagram
Ppl just can't stop criticising
wtf is wrong with yall
That’s messed up
Disgusting comments.
Reels are fun to WATCH…not post….
If instagram is that bad.. should see FB comments. Some people are just bullies.
"Bro some of you guys need to calm down y'all act like you aren't built like the most average person on earth ,maybe consider bettering your ego first. Everyone can do whatever they want with their body, keep whining and laughing because In the end the only thing you tha needs fixing isyourself."
"Damn, Instagram comments are wild and savage. They really choice violence 😭"
Nowadays internet is just advantage to do like these kind of hurt?
The boy looks gay maybe he married her only to hide his real self and please his religious family??
Let them be
"It's just ny opinion that, for some unknown reason i feel like People commenting on Instagram are ILLITERATE! 
Meanwhile people on YouTube have som COMMON SENSE honestly which most of the ig people LACK !"
some ppl on yt don’t have common sense too
This is why i dont use instagram people in the comments are so horrible and pathetic with sick minds 🙄😒
Ik im slow but is there a reason why everyone is so rude on Instagram
"Instagram is crazy 
These people just find a way to troll people"
They are just out there doing their own thing not hurting others ... I see it this way if every person in this world liked the exact same things in life we would live in such a boring world
"I don’t get why people get on reels, it’s so toxic

Like are they trying to get bullied?? 😭 

But it’s not like TikTok or YouTube shorts is any better"
This world is a living hell sometimes
"Yt comments: 💕😊
Insta comments: 💀"
this is why u gotta THINK before u post on instagram. or else ur cooked 💀💀
Instagram becomes so toxic... I don't know why people their always so edgy... These a$$holes act so raw for few likes...go pick a struggle Man
I was eager to see how the instagram comments are and now I have 😢🥲🥲💀
Too funny hahaha😂😂😂
"Actually most of haters are men, Instagram and TikTok are full of 30 year old men with a belly and a bald spot or boys under 18 who hate the whole world and try to humiliate everyone"
"If the video was in yt shorts or tiktok, maybe there would be more positive comments"
"Because yt shorts is filled with normal people, instagram is for people who lack braincells."
"It's ok man, just be like caseoh, i mean look at him, how people make funny comments about his weight but he also just takes those in a funny way"
Hahaha i love older gen z and younger millineals
"A study at the university of concordia determined that fat shaming is linked to anxiety, depression, exercise avoidance, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. People exposed to these stigma are more likely to gain weight and become overweight even if they were thin to begin with. It's literally ""a form of stress"" that spikes your cortisol levels. No, we shouldn't ""bring back bullying"" you're actually just an awful human being trying to deceive yourself and others to justify continuing to be an awful human being and posting these comments"
i'd like to see these kids show up to their wedding and try to tell this to their faces. just because your impossible standards make your love life miserable doesn't mean everyone else has to mope like you do lol.
I'm laughing and feeling sad at the same time why
This is disgusting...but i cant say i didn't laugh at onion ring im crying rn 😭😭
"It's funny asf until it's done to you. Remember folks: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""
People on ig do not have a filter what they think just comes out of their mouth
"Very easy to avoid this. Stay off social media. People are fkn horrible, I don’t know why anyone would expect anything less than hateful shit on a big girls IG."
"Most of those ""edgy"" instagram users are disgusting people anyway. They don't deserve to speak on someone's body that way."
That’s actually so rude I feel bad for them I hope there in a happy realationship.
At least bro got a wife
"Bro- what? Just leave them be, they did nothing wrong.."
The mf that said  “bro got his own planet” yeah he going to hell
just being miserable for no fuxking reason
"People like that in the comments remind me why I need to keep fasting and working out.

Poor girl can’t enjoy one moment without creeps commenting on it….she’s so beautiful"
"Their pathetic thought process and miserable decision to comment such bullshit just proves what a sad life they're living and they just want to hate on others who are happy 😩

The couple is happy but these random ass people are jealous.

If you're not jealous you wouldn't care enough to comment shit"
"People who mock them forget or don’t know that what truly matters is love and the strength of the relationship, not other things. If he accepts her, it means he loves her."
i hate instagram. this is why u couldnt go back after the tiktok ban
You are creating another content with those hateful comments.. era of really messed up minds
That last one 😂😂😂
That's funny NGL...But they're probably happy together so it doesn't matter and I would feel bad if it's due to a medical condition but other than that this is funny 😅
"Why do people feel like they CONSTANTLY need to hate on someone?? This is bullying. The man and the woman can choose for themselves and if they don't have a problem living together and having a lovely life, why is it hurting you?? These people need to get a job because they're just projecting atp"
"If there's True love between two people's they don't judge each other, there's only pure love between them❤"
I hate insta comments...
at least they’re not single and lonely lol
You see how easy peer pressure can turn you into a bully.
all bad comments coming from this most immature fake shallow young generation few adults too that are childish grow up ppl try be mature if this couple are happy go glad for them ya all just haters jealous immature to boot
No need for people to be mean at this. Come on now.
Bros a Chubby Chaser 😭
That’s crazy… I watched and couldn’t think of one mean thing to say.
The last one is crazy💀
😢😢😢😢

The virgin simps when a woman is not your generic IG baddie:
Can the people in the comment section PLEASE be NORMAL for ONCE????????
The truth is instagram is filled with valgure and fools 😢
The last two 💀😭
"yk what makes this even worse, half the ppl in the coments talking about how sad this is and what the world has come to r some of the same ppl who be hating in those comments masquerading as decent people..."
The first comment 😭 (still sad tho)
I just wanna know if the comments would be this harsh if the man was the fat one
These are the little shits who stutter and freeze during their presentations.
the ones who can't make a call to order a pizza
this is funny cause on instagram there’s also an account that makes stuff about youtube shorts comments
It’s over for the girl😔💀
she'll be fine
"Now that’s just messed up, as someone more on the obese side I’ve had many remarks such as those made to me and some people are sin and don’t know how much it hurts. I hope they all learn just how they might have made her feel. Its hard sometimes to even look at myself, hard enough with out people talking abt it and I’m not even that overweight😭"
And that is why the worst enemy is a man
Tbh these people need a life this generation is sad..
"when your looking for a positive comment: 

Instagram ❌

YouTube ✅"
I might have the worse one but I can’t say
This sadly leads to suicide the bullying
I hope there are people who bully the bullies so that they eventually stop.
Can't let anyone be happy

"I have a health condition where I gain weight easily even with a healthy life style and then lose weight slowly, not to mention an eating disorder where if I eat I over eat but then I force myself not to eat the next day,  it takes awhile to lose weight and some honestly just give up trying, I don't plan on it i'm 15 and want to be a professional ballerina so losing weight is a very big thing to me but people make fun of me a lot and it really makes someone lose motivation to do anything, :3 I wish her luck in losing weight if she chooses to and I wish everyone else luck with whatever they struggle with and to get healthier ♡"
"If you have a medical condition, none of that applies to you, sis..."
Good thing I can’t see them 😂
Onion ring is wild 😂
Lord of the onion rings 😂
Okay but they’re so funny 😂
Posting provocative content in free access and complain the negative feedback ✅
"To be liked on instagram is to not be black, super skinny, or really big, probably have the body look of chunli or any other person people highly sexualize. there’s many more to it."
I'm going to hell. I chuckle in the comments 🫥
"Youtube comments so nice in comparison. Unfortunately thats the consequence of posting anything online, there are always these kinds of horrid people who think being mean is funny. Sad but you gotta ignore them, people dont wanna see others happy"
I cant believe ppl have such terrible lives that they have to go online and type a rude comment just to make themselves feel betterits honestly sad like get a life :/
"But you went online to write a comment about ppl who write comments😂 your life should be not cool, neither is mine though🤣"
@dearmary7654  I had a stroke and seizure reading that
 @dearmary7654  and that's not my life if you read my comment you would know what I said
If this was a fat man and a skinny woman everyone would be like awww how sweet
"Social media and it's hate on people is terrible 
People should be accepted for who they are or appearance"
U guys are cute couple no matter what ppl say ✨
Some people hate seeing others happy
I think its insane when you really think about how people become so large by consuming so many calories that their body is no longer in its human shape. Like think about hiw insane obesity is normalised 🤯 i don't see it as a way to make fun of fat people but just the thought that so many people can get that way is wowza
"Leave him alone, he fulfilled his dream of marrying Ariana Extra Grande over here"
Instagram users are immature :/
Why are people so judgemental when it comes to overweight people like leave them  alone they already go through so much and plus they don't need people's ignorance and shame yall are so cruel
"She attracted him with her gravitational field 😂 
Dude , I can't!!"
Remember the same way you judge others will how you will be judge in the eyes of God! ❤️‍🩹✝️ stay safe and blessed y’all
And they think they are being a big real sigma (what a total freak)
"X, Instagram, Tiktok.... RIP love~"
People are so rude and will call everyone names but will we ever see their face? No bc they hide behind the screen but obviously look no better than what their hating on.
"These people really lack self-love, spending all their time scrolling and commenting on others, behind the screen, giving away all their attention instead of taking a good look at themselves. Imagine if they stopped avoiding the mirror? The hypocrisy is insane. Self-love starts with self-awareness little boys!

I’m seeing some unnecessary comments here too, and it’s honestly not funny. Y’all are acting like immature middle school boys. Whether you think it’s a joke or you’re just “being honest,” it’s not okay. If you don’t have anything nice to say, just keep it to yourself. This behavior is beyond disgusting. (I know y’all might actually be middle school boys based on how you’re acting, but I assure you, this is definitely not ""sigma male"" behavior.)"
"You are the same
Typing long text with minimum sense"
"This is just genuinely sad to watch, they are both so happy together but then people have to go up in their business and say shit like that. It’s honestly disgusting and disappointing to see what people have become today. they don’t need your commentary about you fat shaming her, they need support and love for how they are living. Don’t go replying to me saying “it’s a reality check 🤓☝️” no it’s not your just being a sore loser for how you act this way."
"Why are we calling bullying ""wild"" and ""crazy""? That wasn't wild or crazy, it was just plain mean and disgusting."
Amazed to see how YT has evolved. It used to be the epicenter of toxic comments. Now that baton has been passed to insta
This is so rude.
Instagram has no filter🤣🤣

"50 Ways why was that video so disgusting.

1. It smells like old socks dipped in vinegar.


2. The texture feels like wet bread.


3. It makes a squishy noise when you touch it.


4. The color looks unnatural, like radioactive slime.


5. It moves on its own… slowly.


6. It’s sticky for no apparent reason.


7. It has tiny hairs in random places.


8. It stares back at you when you look at it.


9. It makes that “plop” sound when it lands.


10. It tastes like sadness and spoiled yogurt.


11. It leaves a weird film on your hands.


12. It jiggles like it’s alive.


13. It smells both sweet and rotten at the same time.


14. It looks like it crawled out of a swamp.


15. It has that unidentifiable goo.


16. It’s damp… even though it shouldn’t be.


17. It leaves a trail behind.


18. It changes color when you blink.


19. It’s oddly warm to the touch.


20. It hums quietly when no one’s around.


21. It has an aftertaste that refuses to leave.


22. It makes a sound like “squelch” when you step on it.


23. It seems to absorb light.


24. It smells different every time you sniff it—and never better.


25. It bubbles, but not in a fun way.


26. It reminds you of something from the back of the fridge.


27. It’s both slimy and dusty somehow.


28. It sticks to your clothes and won’t come off.


29. It drips from places it shouldn’t.


30. It’s oddly lumpy in a smooth way.


31. It makes that awful “moist” sound when squished.


32. It attracts flies instantly.


33. It has a faint pulsating rhythm.


34. It smells like burnt rubber and sadness.


35. It looks like it could whisper secrets if it had a mouth.


36. It feels like a handshake from a swamp monster.


37. It has bits of something unidentifiable inside.


38. It looks worse the longer you stare at it.


39. It makes your stomach turn, but you can’t look away.


40. It wiggles when it shouldn’t.


41. It leaves behind a smell that clings to your soul.


42. It has that “why is this wet?” mystery.


43. It looks like it came from another dimension.


44. It tastes like regret and pickle juice.


45. It squishes underfoot in the most unpleasant way.


46. It gurgles ominously when you poke it.


47. It has a faint, mysterious shimmer—like it’s plotting.


48. It feels both solid and liquid at the same time.


49. It shouldn’t exist, but somehow it does.


50. It makes you question all your life"
