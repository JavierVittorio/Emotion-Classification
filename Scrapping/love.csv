"“No.. No, I don’t think I will.” - Liam Neeson"
He doesn't know I exist like I don't have his contacts
I don't have a crush 🙄💔
"What if you don’t have their number? :) 
“Mission failed, we’ll get em next time”"
"Lyrics:
I'm jealous of T and V 'cause they get to be around ""U"" all the time, and whenever it's you and me well, everything feels alright."
Song name
There is no official name
"How to impress your crush 
How to get embarrased"
I sent this to him and he was like “umm I actually even liked you from  while now do you think we can be more friends it’s ok if no” I was like sure I really like you that day was the best day in my life

"There was a time when people asked me what type of music I listened to and I would just say promoting sounds. Been posting underrated music for years, most are straight bangers as well."
Noice
What you know is also underrated af
how about we keep it underrated
Just competing for attention
Anit no compensation just complete it for attention
You made it
Went Anime Songs☠️☠️
this shit is ass
This is sooo 2024 the songs back then We're better
this trash
Nah
Im your  5400th like
Moye moye hoge 😂
Listen to the Bloom bonus track by The Paper Kites
No never that song is cheeks in my opinion
Reposting huh
Nah the song fine but the edit is A MASTERPIECE
What about my songs aren't they underrated
Dude i like your songs.
Another song you can add is the song Escape From The Underground by Bad Beats. Please consider listening to this song it's a good song by an underrated artist
Nah bro YouTube is weird. I just looked up this song and starting listening to it. Now this video is on my home page. That’s crazy.
Thats why it is called fyp
​ @WelpItsZelph for real
Yes
HAHAHAHAHAHA!
I love this song so much
👍 added to playlist
Thank you
Im so glad i subbed to PROMOTING SOUNDS like every song i hear either if its the whole song or song on yt short and the ones that isnt released yet i vibe to and can relate to in some kind of way yk. Keep it up PROMOTING SOUNDS everything is straight fire 🔥 🔥
"Just saw this, THANK YOU!! Much love"
Ezra too. He went crazy
 @PromotingSounds I think I found my new favourite song
I was gonna listen to it later but nevermind I'm gonna go listen to it
Flawless song*
"You are right Sir, it really is underrated :("
Best songs I have ever listened ❤
sleepingwater - anxiety.
"Bro it's so cool ngl
Edit:dang im back after a year....."
Think you mean song not songs. Don’t know why this irritates me so much 😂
"It’s because he makes multiple videos of this and this is just one. So no, he means songs"
 @dregamingz  no ur still wrong
 @The1Vitruvian  nah. It’s multiple parts so the title is for all of the parts. Scroll through his channel. He has a bunch of stuff like this
" @dregamingz  bro it’s an independent video and there all separated from each other, so if he’s only doing 1 song per video then he should put song."
 @The1Vitruvian  well if he a put “a flawless song that’s underrated part 1.” It would look stupid because it’s not just one song in the series. Unless he focused on one song for the whole series which would just make it one song.
" @dregamingz  okay fine I yield, your right."
 @The1Vitruvian  I respect your for keeping it respectful

FAST CAR IS HITTING HARDER THAN USUAL
Fast car sounds a little different
"whiskey lullaby, traveling soldier, remeber when, what hurts the most, if i dont make it back, my old man- country songs that hit real hard"
"Also ""Down home""  by jimmie allen"
Oh..!
soft as a god damn pillow

Hello ❤
What about last night or fast car or any songs made by Morgan wallen
No thank you
Vincent Mason on the rise fr
This
The thing with this channel is most of the things that he says our country aren’t even close to being country and like every other like 3  they’re actually kinda good
Sounds like fast car aswell
Rq id like to mention that fast car is not a Luke Combs song. It was written by Tracy Chapman a while ago and nobody knows that. Idk just a fun fact for you i guess
Were is A'nt no
You got me thinking Fast Car was playing and it’s my favorite song😤
Jack what’s your fav country music ? Pls recommend
I also love the music as you do

I wish you did love me.
"Just say it and to prove it are two different things I didn’t fall in love with your money. I fell in love with you. Maybe you don’t feel validated unless you have all these women crawling at your feet simple women like me gold digger money money mind WOMEN.❤ i’m not trying to hurt you. I was trying to love you, but you just don’t get it if you continue tearing me down and I don’t think you plan on changing if anything you can make love in your mind hate I don’t want that either. This is not a battle of the fittest. I’m old-fashioned I believe in romance, courtship someone in presence asking me to marry them Timmy. It seems a little more personal and sincere you put these words out there like there’s so meaningful, but there’s no truth behind them. I love you from the beginning, and I will love you till the end. I know you’re phasing me out eventually you will use me as the bad one you already are.. but you’re showing me and all these women in the comments you want loyal followers and servant not a commitment with me as you keep doing it even after I have asked if you are sincere to do it the old-fashioned way I am not perfect. I’m not beautiful. I just have a big heart that love you more videos. You post showing me that you were never the man that I fell in love with your promises to me you’re promising them too. I wish we could’ve started our journey, but the light is dimming more and more molding out and that’s what you intend to do with me that you intend to. You’re doing a very good job and when I’m gone and see if you feel me in your heart and your mind, and then your prayers, I love the never fully took horse course. Maybe you never intendedit too."
Sounds like my new love interest❤
True love brings forth beautiful results.God bless you 🙏❤😊

"Hyunjin yo estoy enamorada de ti también , pero a mi no me gusta que te dejes tocar por tu  ni por nadie , y te voy acer honesta yo no me voy a casar contigo nunca ,si no paras ese comportamiento , yo no soy la persona adecuada para ti , porque yo me rijo por leyes muy estrictas en ese sentido, y eso es innamicible para mi , solo quiero saber si recientemente hiciste eso  , de ir a pararte a propósito enfrente de tus fans para que te toquen ? Mira Hyunjin yo no te quiero insultar y por eso es más sano que tu medites en si yo soy la persona adecuada para , ti porque yo te voy a exigir una conducta correcta y respetuosa esto es un requisito obligatorio , no hay opción, yo no podría soportar vivir con una persona que no se da a respetar ,Mira si tu acabas de hacer eso recientemente después de tanto explicarte claramente mis reglas, y no puedes cumplirlas entonces mejor vete. Porque no es sano estar así. Espero que ese vídeo que me mandaste sea viejo . Porque si no tienes autocontrol mejor no intentes nada conmigo tu quédate en tu mundo y yo en el mío."

"Jej odwaga już sieę odwrócila, gdy zobaczyła Slońce. Kochasz slabe Kobiety. Nie miałeś nic do zaoferowania od siebie. Serce Ci odmrozila, ale bylo też takie w mojej relacji. Venus krąży odwrotnie. Dla Niej to były rutynowe zajęcia zawodowe. Tyle, że tym razem nie za bochenek chleba, ale czy kiedykolwiek placileś jakiejś Fance? Rutyna z Twojej strony. Nie widzę tu Ziarna Jezusa po którym poznaje On prawdę wyzwalającą. Wpadleś w pułapkę zwierzęcych hormonów od Erosa. Natury nie oszukasz, dlatego musisz trochę powisieç, źeby to odpuścilo."

"Their smile 
Their laugh 
How their entire gorgeous soul would light up , lit up 
Time didn’t exist….
Although we didn’t workout 
I helped this soul
The most beautiful soul…
Helped them to a better life,
They were sinking..
Low,
Giving up on life…
I poured whatever good left in me,
Into them,
Whatever soul I had left,
Love,
It cost me everything..
But they are living a good life now..
I’d do it all over again… 
They were worth it…
Love is 
Always will be 
Worth it…

✨⚡️"

"I love him just the way he is no matter what he done ,or not done. I got lost in his sad eyes and he did not know  I found love there deep in his soul that he did not see in himself.  Every note he plays revives the thinnest strigs of a soul and that energy flows in me"
"May you both always be well and happy and satisfied. Mind, body and soul."

Until I found you is HEAVENLY
"Life is beautiful when you have the right family, People and friends around you. I know you don't know me, but I hope you are aware that every good friend you have today was once a stranger. Sometimes we meet someone new and feel like we have known them all our lives. I must admit that I love every post you have on your blog and u seem like a nice woman who would be a good friend. Can we please be friends ?"

-eres para mi 
-fantasmas

"Cascada 
Every Time We Touch

Can't help Falling In love é a melhor
"Number 1 is ""Tears In Heaven"" from Eric Clapton 🥀"
Just like heaven 🖤
Elvis should be one
Me quedo con el #9 y #10 ❤
Dandelions and die with a smile should also be included
Where's the song is love me or not is so perfect song
1.- DIE WITH SMILE
"Elvis was the only decent pick . Heres my list (no particular order) Slow Dancing In A Burning room, Edge Of Desire , November Rain , Purple Rain , Black , Nothing Compares 2 U , Unchained Melody , Suspicious Minds ,Estranged , Always, Bed Of Roses, I'll Be There For You,  I Dont Wanna Miss A Thing , Crazy , Jhoom , Blue Butterfly,  Thank You (Zeppelin), I Remember You, Lenny , Love Of My Life"
"Every one for my daughter my Angel Lisa-Marie Forever38
💔😇🕊🕯🕊😇💔"
"Until I Found You, perfect deserves..."
I picked until I found you for my wedding intrace on a beautiful violin cover it was magical! ❤
Something - The Beatles
"My All time favorite love song is the first slow song my wonderful husband and I ever danced to. That's the night,  when I looked into his eyes, as he held me. I fell completely and totally in love with him. I just knew. The song is ""Straight From The Heart"" by Confunkshun. ❤🙏🏽🕊"
Elvis!!!
Wi$h li$t🧡
Back in my days they showed all top ten songs
Forever Tonight -  Peter Cetera & Crystal Bernard
Take Me Where Your Heart Is - Q
"""I will always loving you "" should be on list ❤❤❤❤"
"""My heart will go on "" is definitely on no.1 ❤❤❤"
"We must assume that “love you like I do” it’s not a song for 50 shadows of Grey, it’s just a regular song about love, that’s it, nothing else, just like “it will rain” definitely it’s not a song from “twilight”"
ordinary too low!
"Perfect song for this time of the year? Garth Brooks You move me. When listening to it, I feel like being cosy with my boyfriend on the couch, hot chocolates nearby. 😊"
What Is IT 1 ?

If you really love you don’t feel the pain.
"Love is full of joy, smile & romance if can be together ❤but love is full of hurt, pain & cry if can’t be together or break up!💔"

Hmmmmm
"No, love is happiness to understand cutu, think to keep him happy and wants to see a  heartful smile of him."
Love is always painful but it's an emotion 😢😢
One person love gives pain all but God loves never before never after so don't worry my sister and brothers
Yes  correct
Love is beautiful for both but sad and painful for one sided love.
Indeed
Absolutely 💯 True
The point that Jesus trying to tell ppl. Everything you do with your heart comes more peace
Thank you for your information bcz I'm jealous about couple or lovers now I'm happy
Very true
No..absolutely wrong...when one person is criminal..then only the situation happens

"แน่นอน..พระเจ้าทรงสร้างทุกสิ่งด้วยความรักที่มีใจต่อสิ่งนั้น เฉพาะมนุษย์เป็นพระฉาย พระสิริของพระเจ้า และเราเป็นบุตรโดยชอบธรรมจากความเชื่อ 
รักที่ดี..ไร้เงิ่อนไขใดๆ หากเรากดดันลูกของเราให้ทำตามความพอใจของเรา แต่สร้างความอึดอัดกับเขา สิ่งใดจะสบายใจได้?
รักที่ดี..แบบฉบับความสนุกสนาน รอยยิ้มที่ชื่นชมยินดีมีชีวิตชีวา เต็มใจ พอใจ สมัครใจ เดินทางไปด้วยกันเหมือนต้นหลิ่วพริ้วตามลม  ดูช่างงดงามจับตามอวทุกขณะความเคลื่อนไหว ความน่ารักเล็กๆ แต่จริงใจ เร้าความรู้สึกว่าปบอดภัยและอบอุ่น สร้างพลังงานเปล่งปลั่งสดใสในทันทันทีทันใด การใส่อยู่ในใจ ดูแล เฝ้ารักษาให้สมดุลกับสภาวะผู้นำ ผู้ปกครองเป็นวินัยที่เข็มแข็ง มีขอบเขตเป็นประตู  
พลังความคิดจึงมีความสำคัญ สำคัญกับทุกความสัมพันธุ์ที่ดีเลิศ 
ขอบคุณพระเจ้า

Eternal truth...
Memang cinta bisa membuat perasaan kita bahagia. Tapi di balik semua itu ada terselip rasa yang menyakitkan. Apalagi jika cinta yang tulus dibalas dengan ketidak jujuran. Dari itu aku tidak ingin membuka hatiku untuk orang lain yang benar benar tidak aku kenal. ❤❤❤
"So true. Little girls believe in ""happy ever after "" after marriage.  Wow..very few marriages are happy ever after.  Divorce rates are high ."

I disagree
Yes that's 💯 correct 😌
"Only the true love of GOD will bring us the love we need to live...
On earth true love is an illusion, sorry to say .."
Lot of time to all to see real love
True love is filled with both. Agape love of King Jesus binds up the broken in heart. John 3:16-17
Tell me why?
Love is full of pain 😢
😢
That is not love! it is evil! 👀👂👽🕊
Noo iam very happy now mavaritho ok

Yes bro 😊
Ssss ❤ pain that' s not bare heart sometimes death is better than love
Half truth

Love is connected two heart and soul. never end to die

"Jis pyar mein dard na ho, woh pyar he nahi

"💯 wrong, Love is full of joy, smile and romance. But aapko sahi pyaar nahi mila, either aapko ander galat intention thaa, isliye eh reel banane wala galat motivation kar raha hai. LOVE ek galat insaan ko sahi insaan bana sakte hai."
Yes very true❤❤❤

Oh yes he is I love you u get to mad all the time I love you but you dont realise it worry about you
"I disagree.  Pure love is all good...pure unconditional love....not a version of it. A version of it is full of hurt, pain and tears and it's called infatuation!  People who are afraid of being alone experience that!!"
💯
If you marry American women
👌👌
"Love=pain, betrayed, emptiness, hatred, anger, emotional damage, 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢"
LOVE does not equal those things. Go read your Bible and understand what love is. The love you stated there is simply a version of infatuation.
⁠IN THE BIBLE IT SAYS RESPECT YOUR WIFE 😊 AND IF U CANT DO THAT YOUR NOT READY😊
Lack of love is pain not love. The problem is no receprocity. So solve the problem... 😊
Absolutely da truth 🎉🎉❤❤❤
"LOVE is just another four letter word like FUCK , AND PISS , AND SHIT , AND DAMN"
STRONG STATEMENT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful lyric😊
"Not true. Love is filled with not much pain, if you apply wisdom. Love is a stimulant to desire to live n do things for yourself n ur partner. Love is beautiful. The sex is amazing."
It's both!!!
More yt promoted crop.
Yea I agree with it
Actually Love is wonderful n amazing but if didn't respect your partner at any where n insulting every where then your right. Because Love doesn't want anything from other partner just simply accepting in front of all to whom you meet. Just that's it. Simple. That's call LOVE.
But I don't have lover please belive me ok ha naku devudu anni ekuvane echadu kavalisinantha. Khani manashanthi mathram evaledhu and happiness Asalu evvaledhu thanks🌹🌹🌹

"As beautiful, as love can be, love also is,  darkened place, it consumes you, takes you away, from friends, and people who care for you, blinds you, to the obvious, HELL NO, NEVER AGAIN, NOT FOR ME"
" @VinceGonzalez-sw5mt  
Then your love was not equally returned.
I'm sorry."
"@JohnMoore-xf5wy  honestly, can't argue that, you're right. But, it's rampant, happens so much more, than you could imagine, especially, now days, there is no ""true love"", that shit, is over"
" @VinceGonzalez-sw5mt  
So I'm told, and it is heartbreaking.
Love created our country! Strong men and women working together!
NOT COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER!
All else will fail.
And.
NEVER give up on love.
Just when you think there's no chance and basically have given up?
💥
LOVE APPEARS! 🤩"
"@JohnMoore-xf5wy  again,  I agree, with the beginning of your post, but, my ""guard"", is up so high,  I won't allow myself, to ""fall"" again, I mean, my X and I, grew up together 40+ yrs, I've known her, I thought, if love is gonna happen, it's with this girl, I'll commit, but, again, ""love"", had a different plan, I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE,  stay cool John"
" @VinceGonzalez-sw5mt  
I understand completely.
I was 75 when I met the Love of my life.
She was 70.
We had both given up on love long ago and neither was looking.
All I can say is press on.
Anything can happen"
Ya i do not want this sorry
Yea true we have to work on that
Perfectly said 🌺
Yes I absolutely agree 💯
BOTH! Life experience. ♎ Balance ⚖️
Yes it's true 💯
Unfortunately
❤❤❤❤❤
Love is all those things ❤
This life is about pain and loss and loving and being loved is our only refuge! I no longer have a place of refuge which makes me a unknown problem for those who have no idea
💯 present true
Absolutely 💯
Tears
"Yep, the intensity of both pain and joy magnified over and over again!❤🙏"
Yes❤
Me duele hoy porque  todabia  te  amo❤❤
Exactly very TRUE.!!!
"Hi you biết không có lẻ chúng ta yêu nhau nhiều quá nên quá nặng, làm cho trái tim chúng ta đau thắt lại,"
THE WORD LOVE IS USED TOO OFTEN FOR EXCUSE TO ABUSE OTHERS
Yes love is very hard to find.
Owhhh yessss its 100% correct 😢
Yeah exactly no one’s to be trusted.
All my love for you❤❤❤
Taking care of a very sick family member for months is love but also painful and sad but joyful
Many people think love is happy😅
😢😢😢
It depends on both the people
"IF THAT IS SO, THEN HATE MUST BE THE ONE THAT IS CAUSING A LOT OF HEALING, COMFORTING AND WIPING AWAY THE TEARS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD.  THAT'S WHY MANY ARE OPTING FOR IT..........."
"@noeldavid5235  Yo, your post, is the TRUEST/REAL deal I've read, you are absolutely correct, I relate to your post, more than anything"
Yes so true 😢
Oh yessss!❤
Your right but God is right there for you always
Yes love is full of hurting and pain and tears but God in heaven knows all all these things are worth it for true love because you have loyalty understanding peace and comfort that were in it together if you hurt I hurt IN Jesus Name Amen 🙏❤️
ความรักที่มาจากคนเข้าใจวิชารักเพราะใฝ่ดีเลือกอย่างไม่คิดว่าจะเจอใครสักคนแต่เมื่อเจอคนในฝันเขาไม่รักนั้นนั่นแหละทำให้เศร้าและเป็นทุกข์ใจแต่ก็ดีคนในฝันเขาดีและสูงส่งกว่าคนทั่วไปแอบรักข้างเดียวไปก็ไม่ผิดแต่อย่าเผลอไปวิ่งไล่ตามขอลายเซ็นต์้ขาเหมือนพวกคลั่งไคล้ดาราละค่ะอายเขาเป็นลูกเป็นหลานก็คงต้องจับมาสอนให้เรียนวิชารักหรือสอนให้เป็นคนมีคุณค่าให้เขาเป็นฝ่ายใฝ่ฝันหาจะดีกว่าการสร้างฝันให้ตนเป็นฝ่ายให้คนอื่นวิ่งตามและเป็นฝันของผู้วิเศษชีวิตและอะไรก็จะง่ายขึ้นเพราะโลกจะเท่าไข่ไก่กนือไก่น้อยในกำมือเมือเรากลายเป็นฝันของผู้วิเศษที่สุดในโลก😂😂😂😂
If it  properly goes on. !
"Cierto,pero los sicólogos siempre todo lo contradicen y sacan de contexto. El amor  si duele en nuestro caso por la distancia y otros obstáculos que poco a poco superaremos juntos y con la bendición de Dios. Y nuestro esfuerzo sincero y con mucho amor y buena comunicación.❤❤❤"
👌👌👌👌Right sir 👍
Love us caring joy and pain and happiness and trusting in each others try it time running out
It is true can't deny this one.pain comes from those who gives pain and they are the causes of it.If the pain lucky enough to survive in those opponent of balance they might like chances of not feel the most pain or hurt especially come from choice to be chosen.
" @sharleeyased9936  
Pain also comes  from life.
From outside of the love, which can destroy the lovers.
One or the other or both.
Life is never easy."
It's hurt a lot 😢
If that's that i am in it
"""The price of love is grief.""
Queen Elizabeth II.❤"
Yes
I hurt today because I still love you
Yes totally agree 💯
Not necessarily! Of course there will be good times & bad but if you’re on  the same wave length you can solve the problems together
Exactly
There will be nooooo pain if u choose a right person if u feel pain or hurt its not abt love its abt the person
Not real love that's very bad quote
"Love is wonderful until your loved one dies and you are left without his love. Forever.
Then love just hurts so much."
Truth.😢❤
"As usual, my reply disappeared immediately, so yes, this is true.
Love them while they're here."
That is SO true and it’s happened to me 😢
Not understand ohh Jesus
" @ln3804  
Please know this.
Your love will go on.
I KNOW THIS.
Personally.
It has happened to me repeatedly and to others I loved.
He is with you.
And I know your grief.
My beloved lady died three years ago.
I wish we could have left together.
Hopefully we will meet again someday.
I wish you peace."
" @mejuluperpetual5942  
Don't fret.
Your love is eternal.❤️"
" @ln3804  
Hence Queen Elizabeth's idiom:
The price of Love is grief."

"1️⃣Life is a moment in space When the dream is gone
인생은 우주 속에서 한 순간이야 꿈이 사라질때
It's a lonelier place
그곳은 더욱 외로운 장소가 될 뿐이에요
I kiss the morning goodbye
아침 키스를 해도
But down inside
마음 깊은 속에서는
You know we never know why
우린 결코 슬픈 이유를 알 수 없다는 걸 알죠
The road is narrow and long
길은 좁고 멀어요
When eyes meet eyes
눈이 마주치면
And the feeling is strong
그 감정은 강렬해져요
I turn away from the wall
나는 벽에서 돌아서요
I stumble and fall
넘어지고 쓰러지지만
But I give you it all
그래도난 당신에게 모든걸 줘요"

Gen z made this list an it shows
What's your point?
 @MUSICOLOGXST  not a real good list
" @6.7Rollin  so you mean any list that Gen Z makes with their own taste in music is considered ""not a real good list"" in your opinion?!"
@MUSICOLOGXST  so an opinion is an opinion!  Your generation has has your taste. It's not uniform!. Hence why I said what I said.
I don't like the list but I love Gen z tbh they're super smart and nice

I will be in Heaven in 40 years or less, and I wanted to give you a heads up. I don't have any say, and I don't know who plans on marrying me. He will probably tell me before I walk down the aisle. This isn't a soulmate or twin flame, just a guy in love with me, so I can't complain.♂️♾️♀️"

"Amén sería muy muy bonito, yo lo deseo, así que cuida mi amor, si a lo mejor no te pide lo mejor yo estaré de acuerdo y eso mi amor sería mejor hablar de eso, acepto y confío en ti mi cielo ya te miré Josy, quiero estar contigo siempre yo quiero siempre contigo mi amor así es, así será Baby quiero estar contigo vivir contigo"

"It could have been…even just as friends…it more but I would’ve given you an amazing life…now you’re used to being treated like shit and it’s always gotta be toxic…you thrive in it now…far way from that girl I met…she as you should still be because of what you grew up in ( like me) you should want respect and peace and you’ll say that boring…when we get into it, it would be explosive but not often at all…you can make up that dopamine and highs and lows in other ways…not with your emotions constantly…u wish I could rewind time and I’d show you your future and I know you wouldn’t choose this life…I saw you on video and that’s definitely not out spirit…I’m guessing you don’t lurch time with your mom or other family members cause they probably scared of you. U won’t be here much longer…think about the person you wanna be and the future you want and I’m not talking me and you but you and you. I’ll always help you"

"Большое спасибо за подборку!
Я не понимаю слов, но для того, чтобы понять душу, выраженную в песне, не обязательно понимать её текст, особенно тогда, когда твоя душа входит в резонанс с душой песни. А частенько бывает так, что текст приземляет душу песни, увы. 
Не зря бытует мнение, что ""мысль изложенная, есть ложь""(С):)"

"Pacat ca asa o muzica atat de frumoasa, melodioasa care atinge inimi ,nu este interpretata de un om ci de AI care poate reda cele mai fine simtiri, trăiri,  exprimari emotionale desavarsite parca izvoare dintr - o inima Divina ,de ce nu ar putea un om sa cânte în acest fel?????!E trist pentru mine sa vad ca oamenii nu mai pot simți, nu vor vulnerabilitate, sentimente, trăiri, bine nu toți, dar în mare parte, mai ales bărbații  , unii care cred ca a fi vulnerabil și a- ti arata sentimentele nu e masculinitate, dar unii chiar sunt mai mult în energie feminina și așteaptă sa fie invitați la întâlniri, la o cafea...inversate rolurile ne fac pe noi ca sa nu putem sa ne înțelegem cu ei, fiind în energie feminina, nu mai știu cine sunt cu adevarat😮"

"Today, I've been crying for 2 hours because of different problems in life. I am only 16 years old but I'm not complaining since my problem is not as heavy as what other people experienced. Because of what happen to me I decided to play the worship songs of God. After playing it I cried so loud and let my emotions come out. I let God listen to me . I am thankful dear God for being at my side even if I am a bad child to you."
