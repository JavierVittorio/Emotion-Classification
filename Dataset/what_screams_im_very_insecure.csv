"Big, stupidly loud motorcycles."
Jenna Marbles’ dog Kermit.
The more you talk about how good you are in bed and how many women you've fucked the less I believe you.
"People whose self-esteem is so low that they can't stand the sight of people with high self-esteem, so they will try to break down anyone they perceive as more successful than them. When a group of this type of people comes together, a major crab bucket mentality arises and they will target people perceived as highly competent or successful for bullying, gossip, false rumors, and other things that should have been wiped out after elementary school."
This is the only valid answer
People who wear facial jewelry
Being unnecessarily mean spirited to people
A constant need for affirmation.

Posting photos with your SO on Facebook every day claiming how madly in love you are and how perfect each other is
Self deprecating jokes.
Those jeans with stitching and crosses on the back.
Expressing hate against a political party seems more insecure to me🤔
Screaming “I’M VERY INSECURE”
People who feel the need to judge everyone in a negative light and who only want to see the worst in others so they can feel better about themselves. It just shows how unhappy they truly are.
Immediately getting defensive whenever you try to help them.
"Was that hate, or were they saying it screams ""I'm very insecure""?"
Yeah for me it's attention seeking/bragging is what I always see on facebook.
Anything Eleanor does in The Good Place. So well done.
I mean if you categorize someone as being insecure just because the have a different view from yours I think you are only looking for a pat on the back by other people which means insecure
"""They are better than me"""

"So were they expressing hate, or not?"

That’s like screaming “I’m the one cheating!”

Truck nuts? Like the ones they hang off the tow hitch?
"Scene:  Gets a notification on phone..  ex gf: Who's chatting to you now?  me: Its a game notification  me: Goes to shower   me: Comes back to find gf going through every message , email and whatsapp...  Does that scream I'm insecure?  Edit 1) Thanks for the responses. I got out of that relationship last year and I'm dating someone of a far better mind and someone who trusts me. Edit 2) I coded my phone ( she figured it out) then I used my finger print. Edit 3) My ex was very insecure and would often follow and check my every move.  Edit 4) I will respond as best I can."
No it wasn't really hate I phrased it wrongly
Daily selfies
This depends on the context. Making fun of yourself can also be the sign of someone who is profoundly self secure.
"Ah, I don't know. Most common viruses probably aren't compatible anymore."
Can someone explain this for us who don't follow her?
Honestly one of the most “small dick energy” moves I can think of. I hate people who pull this shit.

Bullying people. You don't try to bring other people down if you truly feel good about yourself.
I think you mean...  *cries in cermit*
Would you say just hating on people in general? Or do only insecure people hate on rednecks and only self confident people hate on hippies?
excessive amounts of makeup
You are ignorant about grammar
Insulting random people's physical appearance.
I am terrible in bed and have fucked a grand total of zero women.

I think you need to be self-aware in order to suffer from insecurity.

"Lovey dovey relationship posts and the King/Queen posts on FB.    If you have to advertise that your relationship is that great, it's ~~probably~~ prolly  not that great...  e: replaced prolly with probably  e2: the people demanded ""prolly"" be put back :)  e2a: I also could have worded this better, and didn't expect the type of traction this comment received.  I normally try not to lump everything together, as not everyone does it, and saying things like 'most' and 'all' doesn't really work when there are over 7 billion people on this planet. I have a small sample size of FB friends, like 0.000000000001% of the population.  Even myself has posted sappy stuff to FB, but it's a rare occurrence for me.  The above comment was geared towards people who post **all. the. time** about being in a perfect relationship.   I'm sorry if I offended people with my opinion  e3: [Pet Tax](https://i.imgur.com/OOuQuXD.jpg)"
"Calling someone ""gay"" or gay related slurs for what beer they drink, what car they drive, what music they listen to, etc"
I don't really think the ability to make fun of yourself makes you insecure.

Jealousy
"I'm not accusing you of doing this, but I frequently see far-righters making provocative statements in an attempt to ""trigger"" libs, then when libs decline to bite the bait, they waffle and backpedal and pretend it was never said, or that it was just a joke, or satire, or that it was incorrectly interpreted. I'm sure that was in no way your intention. Just something I've observed."

This guy fucks
"Or the vague “ugh, I’m so upset right now....” status where they’re praying that someone asks what’s wrong. If you want to say what’s bothering you, do it. Don’t clickbait your own status."
Had to google what this is. I didn't know people mod trucks to do that!
People who correct gramma
"Using your internal fear as a reason not to do something.  Hate your job? You don’t apply for any others because you’re scared of being rejected, or that you don’t deserve a better job.  In a terrible relationship? You stay because you’re scared of being alone.  That kind of insecurity is the worst imo because it affects nearly everyone."
Wearing a sweatshirt all the time no matter the weather
"Her dog Kermit is constantly crying or whining, he’s seemingly very distressed. For no reason."
"Big, stupidly loud ~~motorcycles~~ vehicles of transport. FTFY."

"People who always have to one up you in everything if you tell a story they have a better one, if you buy something expensive they have to be something even more expensive. Some people’s whole life is trying to win some non existent competition"
So ignant
I used to be very insecure so I'll go from my own experience. Lying about something to seem cool. It's very obviously a signal of insecurity because they don't like who they are now.
I own a motorcycle. I’d literally pay for new mufflers if the bike was loud when i bought it. I don’t know why people think it’s not completely obnoxious when they create thunder riding around.
"Comparing yourself to people thats ""not better"" than you because if you do point out someone whos ""better"" it hurts your self esteem even more."
"bragging about things not even in your control, like your parents' wealth."

This is weirdly specific

"How would this even come up in a conversation?   ""Hey Bill!""  ""Hey Joe. You know, I'm a fucking sex god. Yep, clapped 38 cheeks just last night.""  Lol"
"Insecurity can manifest itself in many ways including but not limited to:  Being shy (not introverted)  Consistently wearing clothes that conceal the body (like wearing the same jumper to school every day year round)  Wearing a hairstyle that conceals the face/ eyes  Looking down/ away from people  Not participating in social media and/ or group conversations because of fear of rejection  Always being exceptionally nice  or   Being exceptionally cunty - particularly around things they are sensitive about - (like if they feel inferior about their grades they will slag off other poor performers)   or   they may try to drag others down with them by general bullying - depending on what their personality is like. Not all insecure people are bullies.   We are all insecure about something at some time in our lives. nbd, really."
You're just being humble.
I’m 2 for 2 for “guys who boasted how good they are in bed but are actually terrible in bed”.
"Nah. People just enjoy feeling like they belong to a group. And they *love* clothing that expresses they're apart of that group. Example: cults, sports fans, ect."

Translating that as hate seems like 'snowflake' talk to me.
When people fish for compliments
"Sounds pretty specific.   I imagine this goes both ways, though. The higher-ups looking down their noses at those beneath them and rubbing it in or criticizing their worth.   Basically don't be an asshole, folks."
"When people have and insist on constantly checking on their SO via some tracking app on their phone.  It's one thing to have it and use it in case of emergency, but using it while out with your friends to make sure he's actually at work is creepy and super insecure."

People can be very secure in their low self esteem
Glad you said 'ex' he because that shit should not be tolerated.
"you were given the chance that only certain people close to gods could have, and yet, you chose to waste it."
No compliments either though.

You can tell them that their truck is dick less and there is no way to refute it.

Going out of your way to enforce rules.  &amp;#x200B;  One of the managers at my apartment complex told me to keep the music on my phone down while I was at the pool.

They were just salty they were making minimum wage and were not attempting to do anything to better themselves while diving even further into a mideval re-enactment group"
This is why I divorced.
"I've just started unfollowing people on my FB who constantly whine, complain, are toxic, rant about religion/politics or are just plain boring in the sense that all they post is bullshit like what they ate or what they are watching on tv.  &amp;#x200B;  It's actually thinning the herd quite a bit and making me realize just how much I don't even like FB."

"The hat doesn't really have to do with the political party, and more with a movement that expresses almost nothing but deep insecurity. They think foreign invaders are taking their jobs. They think environmentalism will take their jobs. They think feminism will take their jobs. Really they want to hold onto the money, and they've been tricked into thinking the only way to keep the money is to regress socially and never try to accept or learn new things. And suddenly they have a very bright hat to express their solidarity with that type of thinking. I think it's a pretty reliable sign of insecurity."

"No joke, most people have a habit of listing their insecurities in the first few lines they will talk to you. If someone feels the need to describe themselves after they meet you, it's a very safe bet everything they list is an insecurity. ""Well I'm a really nice person, Im really smart,"" etc."

He was a really nice guy and not one that would cheat. I think a past relationship did her in. She tracked that poor man on his phone. Was insanely jealous and probably drove him crazy. They moved so I havent talked to her in years.

If you talked to them separately they were nice enough. They even seemed a little timid, but when they were together their attitude would do a complete 180. They seemed to feel powerful when they could be asshats together and felt sheepish when they had to mingle with the people that they spent 90% of their time talking shit about. They just looked small from the outside."

"People who try to NOT look insecure by bragging about everything possible, everywhere, everytime.   I don't care how good you are at (insert random competence here), if you're so good then do it, prove it.   I had a classmate whose grades were just enough to pass the year. He was barely considered good enough like we're talking about between 10 and 10,5 out of 20 while U was sitting there between 12 and 20 depending on the matter (had 12 in math and sport but I was rocking a 20 in English, a 15 in French, 16-18 in electronics etc...).  And he kept telling me that he achieved those grades without working. And that he would kick my ass (non literally) if he actually started to care.  Like ok if you're so strong then prove and try to obtain better grades than me but I know this will never happen (and never happened) because you're lazy.   Anyway..."
Someone telling someone they can't do certain things
I think it is a sign one cheated and the other can't trust them.
"Yeah I dunno, I feel it will depend on the persons intention when they say it. Me and my friends say shit like that all the time but doesn’t mean we’re homophobic/racist etc etc as we have friends and know of many people of different sexual orientations and races etc."

"As from my own experience, people desperately trying to avoid other people's eyes. I'm so insecure in public areas I can't stand people looking at me. I can also tell when a person is struggling the same way. I sometimes catch myself giving people weird looks, so they stop looking at me. I hate how rude this looks sometimes. My fear of judgment is irrational and makes me act weird or rude."
I think it's notable to say rednecks and hillbillies because we make regular Americans feel better about themselves. We're a punching bag for their insecurity.

"In my experience the Harley crowd is just as obnoxious as the crotch rocket crowd, they just exist in different environments. You’re right, the crotch rockets go zipping all over the highway, and are generally bad drivers. They die at high rates too.  The Harley crowd exist more on side streets when they go bar hopping in large packs. They sit at stoplights and rev their stupid motorcycles like they need to be heard 10 blocks away. Then when it’s time to accelerate they make sure to red line first gear otherwise it wouldn’t be as loud. When they get to a bar they are the loudest idiots you’d ever hear, probably because they’ve gone deaf from their loud bikes. While they are doing all this they tend to not wear helmets because that would damage the tough guy image they so desperately project.      The motorcycle group I have no issue with is the ones who ride the touring bikes. They’re quiet and they drive safely."

What's eerier about this for me is that I know that I am probably like this in some parts of my life... Ugh)"

Asking about what makes your potential character flaws visible to others on reddit. That's a big one that no one has apparently said yet.
"This.  It's hard not to do it if you aren't naturally a supermommy.  I get with other moms, and they talk about their kids like they love it and I'm just waiting for the toddler phase to end so that I can get on with my life.  Like, I love my daughter, but I want her to be nine so we can talk bout real people stuff, like what shows she likes or her hobbies and friends... instead of constant *work* all the time.  And yeah, parenting is always work, but I want to have some kind of a relationship with her beyond discipline and potty training. But if I express this I feel like I'm going to be attacked for not loving my daughter enough.  So I latch onto the only things I feel will be appreciated like ""Hey my two year old speaks in full sentences with correct grammar"" or whatever.  Like I just don't want to talk about my child.  If I do it's usually complaining.  So I want to prove that I love her and I'm proud... which I am.  I love her for who she is, but I kind of hate being a parent sometimes.  I kind of hate hanging out with moms.  Idk how to do it without being the insecure mommy bragger."
"As a pretty insecure person, can confirm"

"I mean as a guy who works with a lot of women, That's not really that insecure. Especially in retail, a lot of the ""women"" that work their are immature and talk shit and gossip a lot. Where most of the guys are just fucking around with each other. So in some scenarios it's pretty reasonable"
And next week they will be sooooo in love with someone else
Unfortunately in my experience the dick is in the driver's seat way too often.
"Making up lies about yourself. Like sometimes one of my friends said they did something great, but then something else they said in the past contradicts them. Insecure people have a hard time telling the truth because they think other people wont like them for who they are"

People who seem overly concerned about the lives of LGBTQ people. It's odd when a straight guy thinks about gay people and what they do with their dicks more than gay people do.  By people who are concerned I do not mean those who are in support of LGBTQ people but rather people who are homophobic or transphobic.

"There's a guy I work with at a factory, and while he's not the best worker, he's not the worst either. Things aren't great with his relationship with his girlfriend (the mother of his two children), and he comments on the same people all the time. There are two particular female employees he remarks about if they call off or mess something up (which we all do these things). He almost always uses the word ""worthless"", and I can't help but think that's likely some reflection of how he sees himself."
What does this mean?
"Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault"

What about a mix? Like someone who has had lots of sex but also talks about her number because she’s insecure.
Depends on the school I guess.
C'mon now reddit. I'm not even a truck person but just because someone has an interest in big trucks means absolutely nothing about their personality. Take a step back and try to be a little less judgemental.
Basically a sunk cost fallacy. People are scared of losing things they put time and effort into even if it makes them worse off. Affects everyone differently I guess but its always there.
When you post a million selfies on social media. It screams “please validate me!”
Saying sorry all the time.
"This type of person was actually my former scout master in Boy Scouts. I lead better than him as a regular scout and he couldn't accept that.

I mean you can go without an online presence but still have a lot of close personal relationships and be very secure with yourself.

"My dad told me about being a kid in the army (joined up when he was 17) and feeling really insecure due to listening to all the other guys in the barracks brag about how much tail they were getting... he wasn't getting any.  Years later he thought about how small the nearby town was, that the population was less than that of the army base, and that the number of available women was therefore *very* small compared to the number of braggers.  That was when he realized they were ALL lying.    It was the ones who weren't bragging that actually had found friendly girls, and they had no intention of drawing any other guy's attention to a potential source of nookie."

"There's no such thing as a good password, honestly.  Edit:  I use a password manager which is itself password protected.

If you’re badgering someone that much, that you seem to be unable to live without them and get angry and upset when they’re not acting and replying how you would like, you’re clearly just relying on someone else to buttress you up.

The idea I have of ops type of people are the extremely toxic type. Not the woman who's afraid shell be beat again or that her husband will kill her kids. The one who keeps being cheated on and runs back to their family for help, only to shove it in their face"
Stop trying to generalize women. This is absolutely NOT true. Women do not just feel “threatened” by other women simply because they exist in the same work environment. That is a load of bullshit.
Alright so play up how unsuccessful I am with women and go for the pity sex instead. Got it.
"You’re right about being able to go without an online presence and be secure, and maybe forgotten wasn’t the right word. However an insecure person my choose to not have an online presence because they feel like they have nothing to offer. Why have one when your life is boring or stupid? Or maybe they feel like nobody would want to contact them. Why bother when your friends wouldn’t want to talk with ya? So they choose to “seclude” themselves."
"Having to know where your partner is and who they're with all the time. A bit of checking in makes sense, but I've seen couples where the woman has to drop what she's doing and reply to texts within five minutes so her bf doesn't explode, or where the guy has to take a picture making a certain gesture to prove he's where he says he is.

Or if she has some idea or something to change, regardless if it makes sense or not, she'll take the lead and go with, ""I think \[it\] should be \[this\]"".. a lot.. looking for a pat on the back for having ""good ideas"".     Really, it's just annoying and gets in the way of me doing my job effectively, but she is constantly looking for praise in some way, shape, or form.. I absolutely understand deserving praise for a job well done, or taking initiative to get something finished, etc.. but to actively go looking for it, to me, seems very insecure."

Karen was the sort who'd brag about Michael's size and sex god capabilities. According to Karen, Michael was SO BIG and had SO MUCH STAMINA, she could only manage sex with him, like, once a month, because he was just TOO GOOD. It was too much for her to handle. Also, Karen once told me, completely unsolicited, that she really loved anal and wished she could do it with Michael, but gosh darn it, he was just too big to fit up there.   It didn't naturally come up in conversation, ever. She just liked to bring it up. Like a tic. Shoehorn in that Michael, by the way, was huuuge.  They were a strange couple."

"We have a saying in my country : ""الحرامي بفتكر كل الناس بتسرق""  which translates to  ""A thief thinks everyone steals""  A partner who's first assumption everytime you're away is that you're out there cheating is most likely projecting what they themself would do in that situation, or just extremely insecure and controlling. Either way it's a sign that you should get out."
"Best thing to do is honestly just make a point to apply to random ""reach"" jobs, or dream jobs as a joke.  Oh, it's a IT job that pays well that require 2 years of experience and all I have to offer is I put new ink in my printer the wrong way the 1 time I tried it? That would be funny if I got that job. Ofcourse take the application serious, but alot of weirder stuff happens than getting a job with 0 experience, and it doesnt hurt to apply and can get you feeling better about applying in general and could ease some anxiety  Do this a few times and you might feel better about applying to places, and you may even surprise your self with what job you're offered or called back to get an interview for. You dont 100% know what the employer is looking for by just looking at their job ad. You might go to an interview and someone likes you as a person and thinks they can train you for what they need and you all of a sudden have a nice job you're happy with with a good boss who recognizes you as a person"

I’m in my mid 20’s and it’s crazy to me to see people double my age that are professionals acting this way. Its so obvious that they are so insecure and unhappy with themselves.

"My brother and I hung out with a guy for a while who was the absolutely king of one upping people.   It got to the point where we would make up slightly unbelievable stories to see how he would one-up them.   Here’s some of the gems he presented us: His father competed in an underground street fighting league with a titanium leg; he once watched a man get hit in the face with a severed penis; and he shot a metal target 100 yards away, blindfolded, judging its location from the sound of someone else shooting the target.  *Clarification on the flying dick*: So, he claimed to have been an EMT for a year (which didn't seem possible with the timeline of his life, but that's beside the point), and he drew a lot of his stories from his 'EMT days'. One day, he says, he's working with a guy who's been an EMT for thirty years. They get a call about some domestic violence, so they head to the house where the police are already inside. Our friend says he stepped into the house ahead of the veteran EMT, and he was greeted by a screaming woman waving a severed penis at the two police officers already inside. As soon as she saw him she hurled the cock right at his head, and he ducked out of the way. The airborne penis flew through the threshold of the door, striking his EMT partner in the face. The man looked down at the bloody dick on the ground, looked up at our friend, the police, and the still screaming woman, threw up his hands and yelled ""That's it, I fucking quit!"" and turned around and walked off. He said he never saw him again."

In my experience most people don't talk about their sex life unprompted. If it comes up in conversation and they give a factual non boasting answer then you can probably believe them.

I use to wake up in the middle of the night to my ex going threw my phone. I also had to park a 5 minute walk from my apartment so she said the gentlemanly thing to do was drop her off... ok fine. I stopped after finding out she took that time to jump on my laptop and read through my private social media posts and web history... She didnt last long

Young couples are sometimes just so fucking happy and proud of their relationship that they need to advertise it to everyone, especially if it's their first real relationship. They just don't realize that other people don't give a shit.   Also, people who especially hate couples posting pictures of themselves on social media are sometimes lonely and insecure people themselves."

Like if you know someone is going through something bad and everyone is publicly shitting on them you can say that there in a rough spot is all. Gossip can be good if its constructive.

Now, in a cavalier, devil-may-care mood I might not care or feel a bit frisky and even enjoy it! But if you have to do a presentation in front of a group or just walking up to a teller at a bank or something.... Do you guys ever notice a female do a quick glance down at your junk, maybe the slightest smile or not? The thing is I can never quite tell if women/people do that all the time, like everyone does a little ""scope/glance"" with everyone and me going comando just makes me THINK about it and wonder if they're checking out my sledgehammer, or what exactly is going on? It's impossible to tell. Does everybody with a dick have some degree of self-consciousness in this regard or am I overthinking?  Genuinely mystified.

That said, this applies to a LOT of people who drive trucks and other large vehicles regularly, especially in urban and suburban areas.

"My personality. I like to think  that I'm a relatively nice person, and people tell me on the daily that  I'm very nice and sweet, but I still feel like I'm an unpleasant person  to be around. I sometimes talk too much, or I'm unnaturally silent for  long periods of time, and I feel like that makes people uncomfortable. I  hate being around people that talk too much, so when I feel like I'm  talking too much, I shut down completely. I also tend to get very silent  for long periods of time, and when I do this, I can see people getting  bothered by it. It makes me feel really uncomfortable and I don't know  what to do with myself after that."
"ETA as of Monday 12:25 US Eastern Time, to add some details/clarification.      I get using it to inform people or to socialize if one's sick.  Or to look for emotional support. That's probably a lot easier than calling a bunch of people.     It gets weird when they then want privacy after posting it on social media.  Or when they're asking friends for medical advice on urgent/emergency situations when they have good health insurance.     Original Post:     I've always thought the hospital thing especially weird.  Also weird, ""I have \[symptom of something which may require an ER or urgent care visit\], what should I do?""  Maybe go to the ER or urgent care?  These are people with health insurance, mind you.  I can see posting to see if anyone else has had x symptom or condition.  Or what questions to ask your doctor."

"Sounds like someone’s a bit insecure.  Social media is a way for people to share to their family and friends what they’re up to. Now if you think they’re just doing that to make “everybody envy” them then that’s a problem with you. Not everything is about making you jealous, some people post for themselves."

"That sinking feeling when you realize you're about to work with a group entirely made up of other women is legit. I don't even consciously avoid women, nor would I ever dream of proclaiming that I ""don't get along"" with other girls since that's just not true, but there's definitely always a distinct sense of wariness regarding collaboration with women I haven't met before. Usually they all turn out to be chill and everything is fine, but those rare encounters with an insecure ultra-bitch make you want to trade in your vagina and swear off womanhood forever.  I think a big part of the issue is that ultra-bitches know exactly how to cut other women down, and the dynamics of all-female groups make it really difficult to retaliate without bringing unending shit upon yourself, because ultra-bitches tend to have some level of skill in psychological warfare and few qualms undermining group cohesion to fuck someone over. The dude equivalent is typically just kind of an annoying douche who gets ignored pretty quickly, and he's not going to be as willing or successful in torpedoing the team's goals for his own ends.  Rampant generalization, of course, but it's been true often enough to give me pause about all-female groups."
"There's a reason they do, they like being the one girl in the group. Oftentimes if another girl joins that group as a friend the original girl will hate her, because she's no longer the only female that can pretend to not love all the attention."

Having also worked with kids aged 5-11, I find I actually like kids -- they've got their own little culture and it's fun to talk to them. But below a certain age, you're not really building a relationship with them, you're just *wrangling* them. And boy are some of them a nightmare to wrangle."

"My girlfriend's parents are like this.  Literally the last two times I spoke to them, I was trying to mediate a conflict (and heavily taking their side, possibly overcompensating for bias) with their daughter/my gf. Both times, as soon as I suggested maybe they weren't all sunshine and rainbows they immediately told me to get out of their house, called the cops when I tried to calm the situation down and get it back on a sane track, tried to insist that they finish the conversation with their daughter while I waited in the car, and declared her not ready to have an adult conversation with them when she refused to continue without somebody there to support her.  And they don't see any reason for her insisting she has another person with her when she's in deep conflict with them (""it's a family matter. No one else should be involves."") nor any reason to have those discussions in a neutral location."

"My [25M] two closest friends are both women [25F and 27F] one of them was engaged and whenever me and her would hang out alone he would insist to her that he wasn’t threatened by me. Whenever she would go out with me and our other friend he would check with the other friend to make sure she was actually there and it wasn’t just me and his fiancé. He didn’t trust her around me at all. We used to joke that we were secretly having an affair, which we weren’t.  Of course, his insecurities weren’t totally unfounded though, given that for the last month of their relationship me and her were sleeping together..."

They say or do something rude and then their eyes bounce around looking for predators who noticed.   That is insecure.   Also, I just woke up. This may be complete garbage talk."

They apologised back and gave me a free 6 pack of Timbits. I still don't know how to feel about this..."

"This sorta reminds me of how I thought about a former friend in high school who always said that ladies liked him, and talked about how he got to sleep around. Never believed him until he got my best friend at the time and couple of other girls pregnant.  I was pretty shocked at the time since we were like 14  (with the youngest of the girls being like 12) and he was 16 (held back due to his untreated ADHD that made him have difficulties in the classroom).  The lesson is: while most of them are definitely lying, someone might be telling the truth and if they are, stay away."

"Most people here are focusing on the manifestations of insecurity that really irritate/annoy/impact people around them. Which mostly makes sense, I guess, since this is a thread about &lt;other&gt; people being insecure.  Arguably the most damaging and upsetting forms of insecurity are the more private ones that don't mess with other people that much. In high school I was definitely guilty of choosing hair styles that covered significant parts of my face due almost entirely to the fact that people made fun of how I looked and made me insecure. My eyes and nose were too big, apparently, and I had acne that was worse than most people most of the time.

"As a parent parent of a severely speech-delayed kid, it’s sometimes just easier to explain up front. Adults will see my 2-year-old and try to talk to him, and when they just get a blank stare back they wonder why. Other kids are usually very understanding and don’t care at all, but adults have a lot of questions.   Like yeah, I know most other kids can speak in full sentences at that age, but mine only says about three dozen words and even then only when he feels like it. He can’t tell you his name, or say how old he is, or tell you what he did today.   No it’s not a competition, but sometimes it’s discouraging to see other kids meeting those milestones while yours is WAY behind."

Usually, what's happening is the woman in question ""gets along"" with guys better because a nonzero percentage of them want to fuck her, or at least are nicer to her/make her feel special because she's the only girl in the group.  When they hang out with other women, instead of being the center of attention, they're expected to actually have a personality, and nothing makes them stand out.  It's a huge red flag, and I've seen multiple relationships fail because of it."

"I live in a rural area, so a ton of people have lifted pickups since they’re farmers.  Funniest thing was being in town one time and talking to a neighbor, who has a truck that could probably pass over a barrel without touching it.  Then again, he farms a couple thousand acres and it’s, y’know, a necessary piece of equipment.  So we’re standing next to his truck, and this woman comes out from the bank, scoffs, and goes, “how small must your dick be to have a truck that size?”  He looks at her and goes, “Nice Jetta.  Does your gynecologist hear an echo when he’s working on you?”"

"This is some of the best advice, and I hope it gets more visibility.  &amp;#x200B;  I was stuck in the rut of hating my current job, but not feeling qualified for the Jobs I was finding when I looked online. I finally got convinced to apply for a Job at a company my friend worked at. I felt I was under qualified for the position since I had little to no experience with the specific product that the company was using. However I apparently interviewed decently, since they hired me on, tho not for the position I applied for, instead they hired me for the next tier team down. Less than 6 Months later I was transferred to the team I originally applied for.      Fast forward a few years later... My wife was stuck in the same rut. I encouraged her to apply for new jobs, even ones that were in a field she wanted to get into, but had zero experience in. She interviewed for a position, went through multiple rounds of interviews, but ended up getting turned down for that position, but ended up getting hired for a slightly different position that needed a bit less qualifications.     Lesson Learned: that job may be a reach, but they may be either willing to train you, or have a lesser position that they are also looking to fill, but haven't yet posted."

"The most insecure person I've met was this friend I had.  I have this friend who keeps talking about how many girls approach him, even if it's a friendly manner, but when I try to talk about that happening to me, he'll sarcastically try and make it a huge deal. I always felt a little offended until I realised he was being really insecure and that he wanted to be the only one that happened to.  He used to keep posting photos and videos asking his ex to come back to him or about how big a mistake she did in leaving him. I understand him feeling hurt, but I feel like it's a really insecure move to beg someone, over the internet, to not leave you.  He kept constantly asking people about his decisions and kept double checking his own decisions cause he wasn't secure enough to make it on his own.   He had this thing where he would interrupt me start talking about all his ""big goals"", when I talk about what college I got into and stuff. I realized he was trying to make up for his lack of achievement with goals that, in his opinion, he'll achieve in the future. I'm not saying I got into an/really good college or that I have any great achievements. But at least I worked and got into my main option while he kept getting into relationships and breaking up, getting depressed, and his parents had to pay his way into a college in the end.   One time, which really pushed my buttons, was when I heard about a close friend of mine from school, from his brother. His brother told me that in school he used to be depressed and have no friends, until I came along, and that my friend really liked me, and felt like he owed me for that. I was so happy cause I always felt like just another average person, and hearing something like that made me really happy. I told that to my insecure friend, and he started saying stuff like ""oh look at you, doing all this nice stuff. You're so cool"" (badly translated) very sarcastically.    Safe to say I don't talk to him any more.  I know this isn't supposed to be a rant about my friend. But I just wanted to use him as an example. Secure people do not push others down to feel good about themselves. Secure people are the ones who pull others up cause they know they aren't any lower. These might not be things that scream insecurity. But I feel like they should be mentioned cause people will notice it. Even if they don't realise it's insecurity and they'll notice it as arrogance."
The thing is i didn't express the slightest hint that i would.

That’s not insecurity. It’s just an excuse to consolidate power and authority.  Other rulers throughout history have done super tyrannical things over the smallest slights. It’s rarely something truly personal—it’s all just excuse-seeking in order to execute action they had planned anyway.

He didn’t take that shit lying down and looked like he was going to explode when telling her off.    4: mimicking teachers’ accents (teachers with accents, y’all rock)   5: trying to take away personal belongings (back story: some kids decided it was a good idea to try and take the hat off of the weird autistic girl who always wears earphones. Aka, me. First, they got a polite request to stop. Then they got a screaming girl who was close to having a meltdown. They apologised but it’s safe to say they won’t be doing it again)."

I was married to an insecure woman when iPhone locking became the norm. It was a hard time for us. Now if you put your phone face down you have something to hide. Yeah, to save battery, not light up a dark room, and not have cops looking in my car for distracted driving tickets.   Ladies, if I’m banging someone else, all proof is on my phone. If I am not, all proof is on my phone.  Notice the word MY? Back off."

Convenience? Who said anything about convenience? I wonder if these pollution control systems do enough to offset the damage they do to the vehicle.  When my work Truck got deleted it's fuel economy went up 20% and the instead of the dpf destroying the engine at 100k miles the engine will now last +200k miles. You can't possibly think that stupid filter can offset that much extra fuel. Not to mention the manufacturing damage building new trucks and causes when these junkers are thrown away too early.

Not being able to listen properly and constantly interrupting people.   People who brag a lot clearly trying to componsate for something or being overly loud for attention.   Not being able to be alone or enjoy time by yourself is a big one for me. It shows you aren't comfortable with being yourself and you're not able to mentally stimulate yourself. Big no no that just screams I'm immature and insecure.   Social media whining or using social media a bit too much, shows people seek validation and just love to moan in general. Avoid these kinds of people, especially if the word ""drama"" is a big part of their vocabulary. The drama is 99% of the time likely to be caused by them just being shitty, cunty people in general.   Putting others down because you're a shitty person inside ( and it's not hard to see)   Not being able to admit your shortcomings or admit when you're wrong. You don't know everything."

"People in raised trucks going 20 miles over the speed limit down the main Street in my town.   We get it, you like attention."
"It's because most parents have no clue how to be a parent. And the only way to gauge what kind of job they are doing is by comparing their kid's progress against their peers. But it's all insignificant and anecdotal, because 99.9% of kids are normal and 100% develop at different speeds. Even still, I get why they do it."
"Pathological jealousy.  I steer clear of relationships where they constantly have to know where I am, who I'm with, and get weird about me having close relationships with my female friends.  Sorry, but I can't hand-hold you through your feelings of inadequacy. Trust and communication are foundational to a relationship. Trying to dictate who I have in my life and/or not trusting me to communicate is an instant deal-breaker"
"Laughing at everything people say, whether it's funny or not... I see a lot of people like that at my hs :/"
Vigorously nodding when someone is explaining something to you.
I think that poster mostly meant if someone asks you for help and then you go something like “Oh so you think I’m not strong enough to handle my own issues?” You know what I mean?
Just sitting and telling people that you are tired that's why you don't socialize.
"Makes sense, if they don't have it for these reasons it could be an insecurity reason. I guess I have just heard the opposite (posting about there life a lot) as showing insecurity more than not being present online. But you make many good points."
"Or worse: No, it’s private.  It’s not that damn private if you’re putting it on the internet."
Me... Sometimes
"I had to unfollow a former high school classmate because she would always post stuff like this. When he was a toddler she claimed one night she put him to bed and he started crying because ""mommy you forgot to say our prayer"". Your kid can barely speak, let alone have religious beliefs at this point, you aren't getting Jesus points for lying about it on social media.   He's 3 now and she claimed he saw flooding (our state is dealing with flooding) on the news, and was inconsolable over the fact people were losing their homes and told her he wants to help. So she posted asking where she could take her damn TODDLER to help with flood relief efforts because he really wants to help. My parents were flooded out, and anyone bringing a 3 year old along to help with clean up would have been a giant headache."
Being me....that will do the trick
"Happy to see ""ex gf"""
"I think the difference there is tact and delivery. If someone tells a story and you immediately launch into your own experience with no acknowledgement, it's a bit of a dick move. However, nodding along, maybe ask a couple questions and then lead into a story, is much better and how conversation should flow."
"This can really apply to anything.  The old adage is “If you have to say it out loud, it probably isn’t true.”  Or another good one. “Confidence is quiet, insecurity is loud.”"

"Making sure your child has everything you never had and end up spoiling the child so rotten and then defending their spoiled behavior... to me that’s insecurity... because you know you failed. Horribly. Arguing with people or telling them to “let me worry about my kid, you stay out of it” absolutely screams “Youre absolutely right, I suck as a parent but I’m gonna do my best to hide it”"
"I say this doesn’t scream insecure, but is noteworthy if you’re already feeling like this person has shown signs of being a prick."
"Reminds me of a time I was waiting for a bus, I was sat next to a couple, another couple approached them, they all knew one another (the men were close friends.) The two couples had a seemingly lovely catch up until our bus arrived. The original couple boarded the bus, waved off by the second couple.  As soon as the bus started driving away, a switch flipped in the woman's brain. She demanded to know why her boyfriend smiled/laughed at his friend's girlfriend's jokes. She demanded to see his phone to see if they had ever text or Facebooked one another.  It was utterly disgusting to watch."

I was so incredibly happy when my daughter hit 8 and we could really talk and she started becoming her own little person instead of a hazardous messy ball of child problems.  Teenage years scare the shit out of me though.

I get if this happens all the time it’s annoying, but there’s a chance it’s just a super personal thing.  Edit:  actually, he didn’t post a vague fb status to start the convo, so never mind.  People who do that *are* annoying"
"Needing a diaper when you sleep doesn't mean you're not potty trained. Nocturnal enuresis (formal name for anyone wanting to research nighttime bed-wetting) just means the brain hasn't associated the need to pee with the trigger to wake up. This connection usually happens during the same time as potty training, but for some it doesn't happen until 9 or even 10 years old. This isn't their fault, just as any other uncontrollable brain activity (e.g. hormone release during puberty) can't be controlled. You can, of course, try to avoid the necessary conditions for the problem to occur by encouraging using the bathroom before bed, but that is only so effective.  Having said that, multiple accidents a day AND wetting the bed in a 20 month old DEFINITELY means ""not potty trained."" I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware that enuresis is not necessarily an indication of a lack of training."

It sounds horrible when you say it out loud, but I’m just done with the baby stage."

"This is so freaking relatable. Let me tell you this, and I hope it's encouraging. My youngest just started kindergarten. My oldest is 10, autistic, missed 98 days of school last year. This whole past summer we had 35 hours a week of intensive in-home ABA therapy, and my kid has been to school every day this year. I can now have conversations with both of them. And I can finally pursue my own dreams while they're in school. I'm no longer a ""lesser than"" stay-at-home mom. I don't have a MLM to keep me busy. I don't just wear leggings and brag about being day drunk. But I'm on the path to being happier again because I'm my own person and my kids are their own people. It takes time, but they do become neat little people with little accomplishments along the way. Don't feel bad that you want the part where only you are making the investment to go away. Telling kids to stop sucking carpet 80000000 times a day sucks. But you got this. Your daughter won't always rely on you for her identity, and you won't always rely on hers for your own.

Sexually active doesn't necessarily mean intercourse though.  A good portion of that 60% are probably just handjobs and dry humping

A decade of therapy later, I snapped out of it and realized that I was acting like a fucking wetwipe on a regular basis and cut that shit out."

"Sadly yes. I was one of them for a while. She was my first gf and I thought this was just how it was, also I had terribly low self esteem in high school. I used to try standing my ground early on and tried leaving her three times, but she threatened to hurt herself every time. So I was kinda stuck in a way. Ended up being a Stockholm Syndrome kinda scenario, she asked me once if she was abusive to me (she was, psychologically) and I said “no, no! You aren’t! You’re just taking charge!” I still shudder at that, I can’t believe how malleable the human psyche is. Even though I knew it wasn’t true, I said it because if I didn’t then I felt I’d just get more abuse. And appeasing her meant I didn’t.   It took me way too long to get out, and she was actually the reason we broke up. I started being more distant (disassociating due to depression) and then she kicked me out for not being myself anymore. But I was elated and immediately packed a giant box and backpack and left a buncha shit behind, but I didn’t care. Told her to do what she wanted with it, and moved states. Best move I coulda made.   Sorry for going on a tangent there, I just wanna help some other dudes out. These type of things aren’t really touched on alot. But men can be abused by women, too. And it happening to you can definitely impact your sense of self esteem. I still have anxiety issues and trouble trusting people with my phone from the relationship, 3 years later. Like if someone grabs my phone I’ll start panicking, it sucks."

She smells so bad that no one will stand near her or hug her as we typically greet one another with a hello and a hug because we're a tight knit group. She will make any and every excuse to leave work if she comes in and sees there are other people working. She takes any opportunity she gets while actually being at work to talk about her sex life, her fet life page, and her ""sugar daddies/Dom's/etc"" to anyone who will listen because she apparently doesn't have anything better to talk about. No one believes her. No one cares in the first place or even wants to know. She's constantly seeking attention, but none of us believe anything she says. We all feel bad for her.

Shut that down real quick.). I'm not certain they realize that it comes across as patronizing and impatient, and makes the ""helpee"" feel like a child.

It's like they're saying ""look, I'm trying to play with the boys by being a sexist stereotype of men about them being promiscuous."" Women who are reserved are always hotter and more confidant.   As a male, I understand though why the female who brags about her sexual ""liberation"" is nice though as those were the ones who didn't require any hard work to earn. They're unfortunately never the one a guy marries though and/or is faithful to. Sort of a stage of life thing I guess. Women who can say ""no"" though (in my experience) are the ones who have all the clout by around 30 when men are starting to think more job and family. Is it a double standard that men want easy lays before 30 and then a clean girl after? Yes, obviously. Reality has double standards all over, it is not fair, it's life."

I have literally NEVER met another girl that games (IRL, of course i've ran into other girls while gaming online).   How am I supposed to connect with other women when they don't participate in or appreciate, or even attempt to understand my favorite activity?"

It's also pretty easy to tell when it's just who someone is versus an act that someone puts on in order to try to seem cool. Still occasionally get told I only do the things I do (athletics mostly) because of some desire for male attention but mostly comes from women who aren't into those activities and are misplacing that they don't really understand why those of us who do these things do the things we do.

Bringing people down when they're happy.
Once I dated a very beautiful Russian girl. Whenever we were together or out she kept asking me  “Do you think I’m pretty?” Even though she looked gorgeous every time I was with her.   My answer to her was “You are always beautiful!”  You should have seen the reaction on her face every time I comforted her. It’s kinda like “My job is done here...” typa reaction.   It was cute at first but when she asks this like 2-3 times on the same date I felt like I was a beauty therapist.   Some beautiful girls look so pretty from the outside but once you get to know them you realize how insecure and fucked up they are.
Being jealous and comparing yourself with others.

"If it's the hat I think you're referring to...   It's often risky wearing it in public. I don't think that's insecure...   My wife contributed to the campaign and got one in the mail and I told her she can do what she wants, but I would hide it in the closet and wouldn't even think about wearing it outside... and we live in a red state.   It's hanging in the closet because we're ""insecure"" about the ""tolerance"" of trump haters."
"Agreed! It's not often, because I work as a vet tech, which is a female dominated industry, but it always sucks when I am the only woman on shift. I feel socially excluded, and a lot of what the men end up talking about is pretty young women which makes me very uncomfortable. I'm not a pretty young woman - I'm a fat, middle aged woman, but that's almost worse. I've also had it the other way when I was a PYT. Being the only woman at work means all the attention in the worst way, or just being totally dismissed as a person. Both suck."

"My cousin and her husband in their 50s are like this. It's definitely a ""guy just wants to be included and check it randomly, but you know if you're having a conversation it's Lady Cousin you're talking to."" I'd say 1960 is too steep of a cut off, but specifically millennial or younger people doing it is kind of strange."
"Lmao, kinda hard since the couple I'm talking about is around my age. But my parents are a solid example too, hence why I never thought being in a relationship was hard because they always made it seem so easy."

"I once went to a store years ago and got a compliment from the cashier woman and from another person when I was trying on clothes. My ""best friend"" at the time was with me and I already knew she was insecure because she had talked about it to me before without directly admitting to it. So I was already uncomfortable receiving any type of compliments around her. A few days later, she blew up on me, hinting that I do these things on purpose to her when that was never the case.) She then decided to tell me that she was going to start drinking because she was so upset and told me I wasnt a good friend to her after I told her that I would rather her vent to me than to drink (we were high schoolers so this type of thing was a bigger deal than if we were much older)... we had tried to make up and hang out a few times after that. She started wearing a lot more makeup after that and those few times we hung out I never wore any type of makeup, nice clothes, and tried to make myself blend in as much as possible so she would get more compliments. (This same girl would say ""you're anorexic but like in a good way"" knowing very well that I cannot control how little I weigh no matter how much I tried and would continue to tell me I ""had no ass or tits"" while laughing because she thought if she laughed, it wasnt hurtful..) We are no longer friends like we were, however I still check up on her from time to time and she does with me as well.   (This situation happened again with another person almost identically...however, she was very manipulative and vindictive to people. She would make the same comments to me but 10 times worse. She would do everything in her power to make you not happy. We arent on speaking terms at all and havent been for some time)  I quickly learned I was just hanging out with the wrong people and in high school, I was just accepting anyone who wanted to hang out with me at the time because I wasnt popular by ANY means.  Sounds weird, but I really hate compliments now because of these situations and I do everything in my power to direct attention away from me."

"Hyperbolic? No that's my real life experience with dpf my work Truck went from 8.2 mpg with a dpf to 11.5 without one. And instead of the dpf cooking the turbos and trashing the cylinder walls at 89k miles (that's when it blew up) it should now last considerably longer, instead of me debating scraping it because the new engine was $20k."
"Married 16 years here... Husband and I have the same four or five passwords/codes/patterns for all devices or accounts. When you trust your partner and your partner isn't a scumbag, there's no reason to keep things separate just like there's no reason to look through each other's devices or accounts. If you experience jealousy or sneak around behind one another's back, that probably means you're not ready for a real relationship..."

"I used to work with several women like this. We once got into a heated debate because girl A was going over girl B's house and girl B was out running errands before girl A came over, so girl B told girl A that she would have to wait in her car until girl B arrived at home, even though girl B's fiancé was home, because she didn't want anything to potentially happen between them. I pointed out to girl B that this screams of insecurity and that it sounds like she neither trusts her fiancé, nor her friend. She disagreed, without any reasoning to back it up. 4 other women, including girl A, agreed with girl B. Somehow only one woman at work agreed with me. Found out over a year later that girl B had been cheating on her fiancé and was not surprised at all."

He is such a shit, I can't be re-inegrated into that, I just cannot."

"I was that girl for a while. It was a combination of insecurity, being cheated on in the past, and trust issues due to catching him lying about other stuff.   Thankfully I had the self-awareness to realize all of that after years of drama and a toxic breakup. I stayed single for almost a year, worked through my issues, and my next relationship went really well.   I hope guys realize that girls who do this type of thing aren’t necessarily crazy—or at least not irreparably crazy—and it doesn’t mean they’re “projecting” their infidelity (although that does also happen). They’ve just been hurt and probably need to find themselves (and/or a therapist) instead of being in a relationship before they’re ready."
"My brother-in-law used to do that to me all the time. I'd go over for a visit, he'd ask how I was doing. I'd say I was good but tired. His response was usually something like ""what time did you wake up today? I was up at 4!""  It's like, good for you. You're also tired. But that doesn't change that I am tired. I love the guy, but that used to drive me crazy."
That's not at all what I said. I'm saying that the people who are being homophobic seem way too concerned with what gay people do with their dicks.
"Over emphasizing something that you're SAYING is not a big deal to you, or constantly having to explicitly state an ideal. For instance, my boss constantly talks about how money isn't a big deal to him, and how he'd much rather be at the job he's at rather than a high profile job. He talks about how expensive things are a lot and how people shouldn't idealize money, and how he doesn't need extravagant things (meanwhile he showed me jewelry he bought his wife that easily was over $1k a piece). He just looks insecure in his finances and really comes across as wishing he had more money than he does."
This. Recently met a friend of a friend online and they think constantly being insultive and downgrading is charming or something. Actively driving people out of the call because they couldn’t stop bragging or insulting others to get a rise out of them. Most of it through World of Warcraft of all things.

Going out of your way to avoid confrontations with people you have good relationships with.
"I have pretty large breasts and when I was at my most insecure, I’d wear really low cut things. Always a fan of girls rockin it and showing some cleavage but sometimes too much is a sign of insecurity imo."
"I hate this especially when you tell somebody they're wrong and they try to scratch and claw about a reason they are actually right, claim you don't understand what they are saying, or that they actually meant something else.  No, you were just wrong."

"I grew up with three brothers, went to a college that was less than 10% female, and work in an industry that is less than 10% female. My whole world is pretty much just men and I honestly feel more comfortable around men. (I feel like I know what to say naturally with men, and sometimes around other women I get flustered and feel like idk what we're supposed to talk about)  However, even though my Male friend list is far larger I still have female friends and when I do come across other females in my line of work I go out of my way to be inclusive and make friends with them.  Genuinely getting along with guys better isn't the same thing as being the girl who actively shuns other women and tries to use ""getting along better with guys"" as an excuse to spread internalized misogyny. This behavior is a literal manifestation of their own internal gender insecurity."

I don't do online dating any more, but my social media contacts are people I know in offline life for the most part.  So there's a chance they either see me on a regular basis or may see me at some point (e.g. high school reunion).       I'm in my 50s and I've gained a lot of weight since high school.  And my hair color is getting lighter to better blend the gray.  I look very different, except for my face.   I'd rather people have the shocked look on their face behind a screen than to my face! :)"
"&gt;Biden was corrupt years ago, ide say it's a decent chance there is its warranted  That may be - BUT the method was inappropriate and reeks of it's own corruption. it is perfectly within the authority of the president to initiate those kind of investigations into corruption and there are methods for doing it. It is not appropriate for the president to initiate those kinds of investigations 1. personally and as a favord request; or 2. in the context of an election.   Trump is the president, so his actions of corruption in attempting to investigate other corruption are more troublesome."
Constantly worrying about what other people think about something. Other people's thoughts are none of your business.  The irony of this on Reddit is not lost on me.
That shit always pissed me off.  I knew a guy like that in college who would always bring any conversation we were having back to how many girls he'd slept with.  I never used to mind talking about girls but it was just *constant* with this guy to the point where it felt like everything he did in life was just about getting to hook up.

Another example of redditors just making up their own context. We have no idea if we are praising the good or bad guy, while we have no idea if people are sending nasty pm’s to the good or the bad guy."

That's why I say that every child has its own pace, learns different things differently and there's nothing wrong with that. Me as an example started saying ""mama"" and ""papa"" (I'm Brazilian btw) at 2 yo, and I have an uncle who started with 3 yo (my grandma thought he was speechless) and he turned out pretty fine. So, don't worry, I'm pretty sure your son beats other kids ass in other matters, and maybe he just don't want to talk, which is a personality trait, and is completely ok"

"I did this a lot because I was extremely depressed. It was just that I saw everything as shit.

Do you think your friend could be struggling with depression? If so, just being there for her talk to or hang out with would go a long way.

"I'm not highly competent or anything, but it's funnily relatable:  In high school I had a group of friends. One of them was alright at first, then turned into a real, dick measuring jackass in a couple of years.  We went to university, (most of us to different ones, but jackass went to the same place with 2 other mates) and at a summer party he was talking about how his degree will be the best, he is gonna ace everything, and how education leads to success, and manual laborers are dumb, etc.  Then he fails out of university the first semester. My other two mates also left it, one because he found a job he really liked, the other didn't like the major after all. I stayed at my university.   Next get together all I'm hearing is how manual labor is the only manly thing in the world, university students are entitled assholes, and a man who sits in front of a computer, (I'm computer science student) instead of doing something like him, (shoveling dirt at a shitty construction company) are pussies and not real men.  I have nothing against university people, nothing against tradesmen, etc., but if you feel the need to drag the other group down, because you are just sooooo better, you are a jackass. Fuck you John."
You know that's bullshit.
I'm a sort-of androgynousish straight guy and I only have one friend who's male. Am I this?
Good for you for coming right in the end. HIGH FIVE!
It's always too bad to see women who don't like themselves enough to have healthy relationships with other women. :/
"I'm afraid I do this, when I read a joke online, I'll just say the joke from a first person point of view because it's funnier said that way. If they ask I have no problem telling them I read it, but the delivery wouldn't be as funny. When people don't ask, I just end up feeling guilty but other times it's just easier to not explain the reference... Is this the same thing?"
That was my experience as well. Same few kids all fucking each other. Also the band and theatre kids at my school were getting it the most. Straight up freaks.
I like kids from birth to 2 and 6 and up. Those middle years are **horrid** and I wish the kids could go live with someone else.

He had the nerve to say, ""RAMEN NOODLES!!? You were rich, I was so poor at one time that I was lucky to eat some rice! You had it good."" I hate people like this."

That doesn’t make their post any less truthful
"A lot of the comments are people being jerks in one way or another but there is the opposite side as well. Dodging certain questions, topics etc. Placing everyone, even those who are technically worse than you on a pedastal or even completely changing everything about yourself whilst around people.   Most of this being from personal experience as I was made to be insecure about my appearance and resulted to wearing hats and loose clothes."
"from my personal experience, having an anxiety attack from not wear a jacket because you don't like the way your arms look"

Working on it. Hopefully getting into an apartment in a couple weeks. I’m currently living with my parents. I’m so sick of football at full volume in multiple rooms and being told I don’t get to be depressed because “I have a beautiful healthy daughter”. I’m glad they let me stay here but it’s a pretty toxic environment all around.
"Changing yourself to get attention and cravings to be accepted. Basically not being your authentic self and trying to be something you are not. And being hard and depressed over irrelevant things (i.e I am not pretty enough), as well as not being confident in yourself.  And being awfully judgmental and condescending to others for petty things or not fitting a certain mold."
And it’s wearing khakis
"&gt; I mean, I agree with them, the slow guy shouldn't be camping in the left lane but what's flashing your brights at me going to do? I'm not able to go anywhere.  I hate these fuckers with a passion. Like they want you to get over so they can then tailgate the offender themselves.   On busy mornings, the ""offending"" car that's going too slow in the left lane might be 15 cars up in a line of unhappy drivers.   But someone's gonna ride my ass in slot number 16 in hopes I get over (To the right lane which is even slower yet) so he can be number 16? Fuck him... Makes me wish I had an oil slick button in my car."
"A brothel in a military town would make money. When I visited Honolulu, I did a war time tour of the brothels in Chinatown. There were so many guys that there was a bullpen system set up where one woman could work 3 rooms (one guy undressing, one fucking, one dressing). The prostitutes had so much power, they went on strike for better conditions and won. Very interesting tour."
/r/amitheasshole is something I enjoy the same way I enjoy trashy TV. The opinions are often pretty extreme and there's a whoooooole lot of reaching.
Womanizer. Plain and simple.
what about wasting hundreds of millions thinking the president has ties with russia? what you said isnt insecure at all you stupid fuc
Constantly crossing your arms across your chest is a bad habit I developed when I was a very insecure middle schooler. Wearing a piece of clothing that acts as a safety blanket (ex: a hoodie). Of course the biggest sign of insecurity is bullying.
Oversized hoodies
I do.
bullying
"Using ""I am very emotional "" or "" I get hurt really easily"" every time you call them out on thier bullshit. Somehow you always end up apologizing and being the asshole"
An asshole and a dumbass? You dodgeda major one.
"That's some dedication.  I was offered a Phd position by my grad advisor, but decided after 6 years of college I needed to make some money."
"Just googled that. I presume it's illegal here in the UK, or that no one's stupid enough to do it. Because I've never seen that."
"Ex best friend did this with me and would constantly make statements about how better he was at everything.  I hit a downtime in my life and he wasnt there.  I moved away and he reached out to invite me to his wedding.  I told him I'm happy for him but we dont have any reason to talk anymore.  You weren't there for me, I wont be there for you, but at least I'll be honest about that"
That is the dumbest reason to get a PhD for. Besides isn't there a difference for being educated and being wise. But whatever floats his boat.
When you wear baggy clothes all the time no matter how hot or cold it is.

"On one hand, she’s insecure for obvious reasons. On the other hand, she went through your phone and spied on you, making you the insecure one.  I’ll see myself out."
Honestly one of the worst things about being a mum is dealing with mums like that. I can't bare the constant comparing and competing. They're children for Christ's sake! Leave them be.

Insecure people.
Sadistic is probably not the right word for that.
Instagram.   Need for a relationship all the time   Staying with someone who cheats.
"&gt; It screams ""BREAK UP WITH MEEEEEE! Also, I'm probably cheating on you.""  Anecdotal story time. Pre-smartphone days, I had a boyfriend that seemingly out of nowhere get pissy about my choice of clothing.  He made a particularly huge stink about one top that was a V neck t-shirt. My tits were *never* hanging out, and I got annoyed at him for acting like I was bare chested out in public. After his little tantrum, I calmly asked him who *he* was fucking because there was literally no other reason for him to go off the rails like that. He turned white as a sheet and sputtered out an apology and never brought it up again.   Turns out that while he hadn't ridden the new filly yet, she was picked out of the herd, saddled up, and ready to go. Needless to say, I checked out soon after.  *Edited for syntax"
I believe you.
"""What screams ""I'm very insecure""?"""
"I agree your own kid's milestones are exciting but when the parent's entire identity is wrapped up in their kid's milestones and now they are competing with the other moms,  it just becomes too much.   And they do tend to even out over time but they definitely aren't an indicator of lifetime achievement goals. The example of your husband is a perfect one. I've heard countless stories about how my dad didn't speak a word until he was 4 years old and no one could even begin to understand his speech until he was in 3rd grade. Back then he could have been easily institutionalized as a child or labeled as dumb, but my dad is one of the most intelligent people I know, however he's just not that articulate."
MAGA hat
"The subconscious or suppressed/repressed thoughts. Others can see the insecurity and they can feel the emotions, but aren't able to peel the layers back and keep asking ""why?"" about the things that make them feel said emotions. The ""why"" generally implies they aren't doing something right or they were hurt badly, and both of those things are hard to accept and reflect on for some. Instead of growing from failure and shit situations, they don't process it and keep doing/feeling the same shit. Or they're so bad/narcissistic that they can't accept they're doing something wrong, and therefore can't reflect on any of their behaviors, thoughts, feelings, etc."
Why do so many drivers feel the need to turn the opposite way before turning the direction they're going?!? Huge pet peeve of mine. ITS JUST MAKING MORE WORK UGGGH
In all fairness my kid had somehow taught himself to read by 3... and would eat grass... and still does sometimes... so these milestones are not mutually exclusive.
"Similar situation for me. I just had a baby in my teens and put the baby up for adoption. My friend's mom knew I shouldn't be alone (I had my own place) and offered me to come stay with them to help keep things off my mind.  I felt loved and cared for but later she told me if she wasn't there or my friend's sister, I wasn't allowed to be alone with him. I told my friend this and he was just as confused. I didn't even bothered staying."
"One of my best friends is like this. I feel bad for him sometimes. He used to do it a lot, and flexed unnecessary things. For example, he has a better computer than me, and every time we play anything on PC, he’s like “ bet you could have 180 FPS and max render distance.” And a while ago, he got a new phone that is better than mine, and he spent the entirety of 3rd period telling me my phone is trash and his is better and showing me all the cool things it can do. It’s extremely annoying and someone needs to tell him how much of a jerk he can be sometimes.  I’m still friends with him because sometimes are worse than others and I know he has a tough life."

well people like him 50/50. so he needs all the public rep he can get
I hate when I’m trying to reach common ground or just relate with someone and they somehow think I’m starting a nonsense competition where we’ll win nothing
"It was a mix of schadenfreude and concern until I saw him climb out of the cab, then it was just funny and satisfying. I called it in to the county dispatcher anyways because I figured there was a good chance he was drunk or something. IDFK what made him think he could take a corner like that in such a ridiculous vehicle.  I wouldn't have gone faster than the Fit (which corner wonderfully btw) in my Subbie and that shit is manual AWD with a much lower center of gravity than that monstrosity (then again, I don't like to abuse my tires)."
"It must be difficult to so aggressively miss the point here, even with all the comments trying to clarify for you."
Nope.
There was this guy that could never understand why I wasn't his biggest fan in high school. He acted like I was just being meanspirited. There were plenty of reasons why but towards the top was how often he mentioned and flaunted his brand new Audi. That and the way he drove it. So offputting.
Lifted truck with offset rims.
Bingo
This one should be at the top.
Screaming that you're insecure
Dude do you know who my dad is!?!  That one always gets me

Constantly comparing yourself to others
"Man... this thread is making me insecure.  It's a slew of just some of the most judgemental commentary.  Folks, don't worry.  It's probably not normal to feel secure or confident in every situation. I mean, with social media and what-not, we live in a world that almost demands validation from peers. If you've ever done some of this stuff in the past, don't feel bad about it. Instead, forgive yourself and try to do better in the future.  We're all trying to figure it out.  Anyways, yes, I am completely aware of the irony of this comment.  I still think it should be said, though."

"Yes, I believe in countercyclical fiscal policy."
"screaming ""I'm very insecure"""
"Them metal Truck Nuts, on them lifted trucks 😂"
not really insecure
"Yes! I think a lot of the time, when people complain about other people always trying to one up them, it's just the narcissist who's complaining who sees everything as a competition - if someone says ""oh, I know what you mean, I got hit by a bus once too"" that's stealing focus and attempted one-upmanship, rather than just trying to relate to the other person and make conversation."
I too am extremely humble
Ooh. Your comment was ambiguous to me. I read it as a homophobe trashing straight allies.
"Or the other one.  Posting statuses or messages like ""Can't wait to see my favorite person in the world when I go home tonight!"""

"Most of what I've seen in that sub is ""I have an IQ of &lt;random number above 150&gt; and a degree in &lt;random prestigious school&gt;"".   Like, IQ is a measure of logical thinking, *not* intelligence, it doesn't matter. And most of the time, the ""degree"" doesn't even corrispon with the subject being argued.  I do admit, there is a lot of ""look at this guy, how dare he be smart"", but there is a ***lot*** more of what I mentioned."
"I say that jokingly. I also like ""if you are going to be cheating on me, she better be really hot"" and ""wear a condom, I'd get really pissed if I get an std"". He usually answers something on the lines of ""ofc, she has huge boobs""."
Stuttering and being shyly quiet
"My sister-in-law pitted her own kids in a competition like this.  The oldest (and golden child by whom all others on the planet should be compared) didn't sprout his first tooth until after his first birthday.  The second child (a girl who was supposed to be a boy) got her first tooth around 7 or 8 months old.  When she started walking early, she was taken to the doctor to see what was wrong *with her* for hitting milestones ahead of her brother."
Wouldn't that be exactly the case when people act like assholes and are not driven by insecurity?
"I went on a school retreat recently and this girl in my cabin seemed to lie/copy people to try to fit in. One of my friends mentioned that she had a peanut allergy, and the girl said she did too. Then later in the day we had a food war and people with peanut allergies had to sit out. She didn't sit out and I was concerned so I asked her about her peanut allergy. She said she didn't have one. I didn't give her shit about it because I think she was just trying to fit in."

We always talked about how obvious his lies were and couldn’t figure out why he kept it up even when we called it out. Since he’s gone to college, gotten a decent career and married an awesome girl I haven’t heard one of these stories in a few years. It all makes sense now."

"I can really relate to this. My oldest child who is now 16 started walking (like actually walking as the main way of moving around) at 7 months and his doctor was astonished at how early he achieved that milestone. When we’d go out random strangers would ask his age because they had never seen such a young child walking around before and commented that he must be a genius. I love my kiddo with my whole heart and he is smart in his own way but he has low functioning autism that was diagnosed at age 3 1/2. He cannot talk at all and still wears diapers. I have twins who are now 3 but when they were in the early stages of toddlerhood, it amused me how competitive the other moms in the playgroups would get over the walking milestone. They seem to think walking early is an indication that your kid is headed to big places. FYI, the world record for youngest child to walk actually belongs to a boy who walked at 6 months in case anyone is curious."

"Bragging. Don't get me wrong, if you just won an award or passed a super difficult test go for it. But constantly bragging and making others agree with you is just a desperate attempt at validation. Bonus points if it's something materialistic such as money, cars etc. More bonus points if it's something they haven't earned, such as getting a 5000 dollar allowance from every month from daddy's pocket. Even more bonus points if the person literally pushes you down in order to raise themselves up in front of people.  I speak from experience."
"Yeah, this was my experience in middle school (and most of high school). I feel like girls age 8-16 are conditioned to be vicious and catty toward other girls, and I was a tall, gangly poor kid who moved a lot, so I was definitely stonewalled/gossiped about by other girls. Boys in that age group primarily didn't judge me based off of my clothes or height, so they accepted me a lot quicker and I formed stronger friendships.  It took me a really long time to be comfortable having female friends after that. Even now, I have significantly more male friends than female friends."

Always making fun of peoples' appearances, told his own wife (my ex best friend) that she looked stupid when she wore a really cute dress, told my husband he looked stupid for wearing a light blue shirt (what?) Told me I look stupid for wearing makeup. He's so obviously deeply insecure and so easily offended by every little thing that he became impossible to be around. And of course now he's gotten even worse and is spouting a bunch of racist and anti-lgbt bullshit. Unfortunately his wife is heading in the same direction and her backbone is becoming less and less existent. Better off without people like that."

"FOMO. I've had co-workers that feel the need to insert themselves into meetings that they were not invited to (even though the topic is not relevant to them), or get jealous or bitter when they aren't invited to a lunch. And there's managers who micromanage because they can't stand the idea of employees having meetings and thoughts and ideas and plans without them. When I see this behavior, it reminds me of children who don't want to go to bed early because they feel like they're missing out on all the fun that the adults are having late at night. These people are so needy to feel included that they actually end up turning off others.  We all need to accept that there are times when our presence makes sense and will be requested, and other times where we are not as important to the conversation and should gracefully bow out. If you think you would really have something to add, then sure, insert yourself. But if the reason that you are inserting yourself is because you feel left out or you are just nosy and want to know what they are talking about, don't do it. It's so obvious and a real sign of insecurity."

"It was a pretty small highschool, my graduating class had 60-80 kids in it.  Mostly, it's because relationships there were a *mess*. I dated my HS girlfriend for 3.5 years, there were a few other couples that stayed together for most of it, and then outside of that there were just a fuck load of 3-6 month relationships that all inevitably intertwined. Obviously I didn't know *everyone's* sexual history, but by the time graduation was rolling around, most people had been involved in some form or another, be it a hookup, relationship, or just a casual friends with benefits type thing. Eventually, information gets around and nobody really had any reason to lie about it since having sex with someone wasn't really a big deal (ie if you said the shit about sleeping with everyone most people would just say ""cool man"")  It's worth noting IMO that it was a decently rich highschool with a lot of privilege so I feel like people just got...bored? Idk, all I know is it had an insane amount of sex and weed use. Like, I got to university and people would talk about sex in highschool as if it was a rare thing and meanwhile we would have people going out to their cars and having quickies at lunch.  So not like I knew *everyone's* sexual history, but it was a small highschool with a lot of intermingling in the dating pool so shit got around (including a few STIs cause it was a Catholic highschool so the sex Ed boiled down to ""don't"")"

"No, my confidence *in* grad school was just fine. I never encountered what people refer to as “imposter syndrome.”  It’s *outside* of grad school, among friends and family and strangers, that I feel insecure about my intelligence. My inner voice constantly tells me “They don’t believe you. Show them your thesis or a photo of your diploma” and I constantly have to shut that thought down because it’s pretty pathetic.  My friends, co-workers, and family don’t have PhDs, but they’re quick-witted and intelligent and I sometimes feel I’m nowhere close to that."

Vampires are VERY immature
That used to be me in high school. But it was because I didn't want to date or talk boys so the girls thought I was quietly undermining and fucking everyone or something I'm still not fully sure. It's evened out now though
"Me, right now."
Not liking to be in any pics.
"The handwriting looked feminine so we thought it was either a straight woman who was into my husband or a lesbian who was into me. Whoever it was, we both got a little ego boost from the note!"
"Bragging about yourself constantly, specifically on social media. Constant selfies, constantly degrading people."
"Truck-Nuts, I have no idea who is so insecure about their own masculinity that they need to visibly identify the sex of a car. Bruh it's a car."

This girl I'm friends with often asks me to turn my Snapchat location on when she thinks I'm hanging out with people without her. She also texted me when I didn't like her Instagram post asking why.
Comparing compulsively yourself to others
my mom was all proud that i started walking without ever crawling (by holding onto a chair and moving it around the house)  guess who has fucked up shoulders nowadays...
"I got home last night from a guy trying to get my girl to do coke and god knows at his house from the bar. Instead of whooping his ass we trolled him to an oblivion and made him feel small, so what I'm saying is, nothing screams "" I'm very insecure""  more than a guy trying to get a girl to fuck and do coke at 3-4am. P.S she trolled him more than I ever needed too and i love her for it."
There'll be robot girlfriends soon. My advice is to hold out til then.

Not being able to not give a fuck. A little different than not giving a fuck.
Self reflection = introspection
Twice daily instagram selfies.
Saying “I’m sorry” a lot
"Hypermasculinity or believing in an ""alpha/beta"" social dichotomy. Usually people who wrap themselves in an extreme parody of what society expects of them have some deep misgivings about their own identity (otherwise why would they try to smother it with social conventions?)."
Maybe she just thought that instance was adorable?
Claiming yourself as secure and labeling someone as insecure.
Yeah besides the fact they literally handle your food they are just doing their job
"It helps when the other person is driving but you're listening to music on their phone. I never feel the urge to go through my girlfriend's phone, but in a loving, trusting relationship it's just easier to be able to get on to each other's phones to do normal stuff."
Still not as difficult as you trying not to be a condescending douchecunt posting a completely redundant comment. Now THAT'S difficult.
"I love it. But for a second, when I saw the letter _d_, I thought it's going to be a differential theory of drama."
"Mistaking every act of human kindness as romantic interest. I used to be friends with a girl who was really insecure who thought we were perfect for each other, just because I was nice to her when most guys weren’t. Yeah.... insecurity isn’t very attractive, you have to learn to love yourself before you can expect others to do that,"
"&gt;  he then tried to turn the whole thing around on her and say she was the one at fault because he saw the text conversations between she and I where she confessed that if she’d known how shitty he was she wouldn’t have married him.

We can lead the horse to water, but can't make it drink."
Threatening someone or getting in their face for hitting on your bf/gf. It's more of a power move to just not give a shit because you know your so ain't gonna go for it anyway.

I had to leave r/nothowgirlswork for just that. I figured it would be a good place to see what silly mistakes other guys were making so I could avoid doing that myself. Instead the community liked to construe anything to basically say all men were trying to rape/beat them or enforce gender roles.

"When you constantly try to ""one up"" someone. You always have to have the most over the top experience or obstacle to overcome while in a similar situation as someone else. You obviously coming out on top everytime. Had a boss like this, he ALWAYS had to have the spotlight. It got to the point where no one would really tell stories around him. Whats the point if your not allowed to have a moment."
That is probably because you are a decent human being and not a narcissistic asshole.

"I was just thinking about this last night because it's something I've done and sometimes still do, although I see other people do it more. &lt;-- Satire right there.  I've made a little saying for myself. ""Unsolicited criticism should be received as an admission of ignorance."""
"Feeling like everything someone does and says is designed to attack you.   Perfect example from today: a car horn was malfunctioning across the street. It woke me up at 4am. I call the police, they send someone out, the cop stops it at like 5:30 and it started malfunctioning again 10 minutes later. I go into the living room and my roommate mentions the horn, so I start telling the story, but I'm annoyed when I'm telling it, and he assumes my annoyance is about him. And within 4 words he starts mocking me and yelling at me for attacking him. I go ""what? I'm mad about the blaring horn coming in my window not you!"" And then he goes on to say that I'm either personally attacking him or ignoring his existence. So he thinks literally everything I do is about him and designed to hurt him in some way. I dont know what to do to make him think I dont hate him, but also I fucking hate him cause I have to tiptoe on eggshells whenever I'm near him. It sucks."
"Every office I’ve ever worked in (six, to be exact) has been like this, except the women will treat almost anyone like an outsider. Even if they’re not threatened by them, they’ll gang up on them and try to drive them away for no reason at all. I’ve never been able to wrap my mind around what they get out of treating people this way."

"As someone who’s been there, I’d recommend taking some time to be single and work through your issues either with a therapist or through intense self-reflection/journaling/meditation. You say you trust him, but the fact that you go through his phone proves that’s not true. When you’re ready for a relationship you won’t feel the urge to check his phone. You won’t worry he’s cheating. You won’t get jealous over female friends.   Not only is it morally wrong to breach his privacy and go through his phone, it’s unhealthy. I promise the peace you will feel when you overcome your trust issues and insecurities is totally worth the time away from dating."
"Needing needing to have control of things in your life otherwise you are constantly anxious about what you can't control and it's a problem because it's not how you like it or want it or ""need"" it"

"I don't think it matters either way, insecure people just want an excuse to make fun of someone else, be it because of someone else's low intelligence, or because of someone else's perceived ""high intelligence"".   &gt;Like, IQ is a measure of logical thinking, not intelligence, it doesn't matter  Also it does matter, to an extent. Iq is a great way to predict success. Now if you're a neckbeard angrily typing on the computer about your intelligence and how the world's failed you, the prediction doesn't matter, but lets not pretend iq is meaningless"

"Cheating. If you weren't insecure you would have no problem being single for a window of time instead of juggling multiple people in secret to have the advantage of ""choice"". Cheaters always want the upper hand, hence their tendency to gaslight.   Speaking from experience.

"It was already established that it’s people who drive extremely aggressively in those tricked out trucks.  I know of a couple people who have lifted trucks and use them for legitimate purposes, like getting to hunting spots.  They drive fine on roads.  Then I know of some local yahoos who have lifted trucks with the mufflers cut down, and all they do is aggressive and illegal driving (speeding well past 10 over, passing in no passing zones, etc)    Never seen anyone on here take issue with a motorcyclist who’s driving responsibly, only the reckless ones.   It ain’t hard to see which group is fine and which isn’t.  Stop making generalizations about how people are perceived on Reddit."
My favorite is when someone gets pissy people aren't agreeing and they start to make passive aggressive edits or assume everyone is a teen/have no social life/is a sjw/is an incel because obviously a mature and sane adult would never disagree with them...

"Used to teach the child of one of them.  He carried himself as vastly superior to his peers, because his dad was a logger making a decent living.  Family had no health insurance, dad had no retirement account, 3 ex-wives, was illiterate (his son read and signed all forms), etc.  I think the son went through 4 trucks in 6 months, showed up every day with Hardee's breakfast, often left early to go work with his dad, always had nice clothes and a clean haircut, etc.  The kid ended up dropping out when he was 18 to work for his dad because he just had no value of the education.   He apparently talks about going back for his GED but I don't see him making it, right now he is making money so that's all he cares about."

"Heads-Up : My father died in 5th grade so it messed me up all the time. I had very few friends and when they arn't around, I'm really lonely ;(   In the 6th to 7th grade, I was known as ""The Art Kid with ""  and this girl had a massive crush on me. I didn't notice until it got a little obvious ( her looking at me when I was in the cafeteria, class, gym, etc.) I was flattered but extremely confused because people also thought I was an emo for having long hair; and being a psychopath ( drawing horror and Gore ).  Anyways, she told me in my mathematics class that she had a crush on me for 6 months. I didn't think I could hold the title of ""Middle School boyfriend"" to her, so I anxiously declined. I feel bad because she actually enjoyed my company, but boy was that a train wreck.  PS : Don't feel bad about my father. Yes I still miss him a lot, but it's not like I can do anything about it. PSPS : this is my first Reddit post so I suck at he sort of thing :)"

"The size of the truck you drive isn't a very good metric for your character and how insecure you may be, but how boastfully you talk about it is, and how much distaste you have for anything but giant lifted trucks definitely is.  Like, I have a ton of great friends who like driving their big pickups, but if we go to the bar and carpool in an SUV they aren't shitting on the owner for driving something under 6' in height.  The people who would are usually the same people who leave their shopping carts in the middle of the parking lot at the grocery store, don't hold doors open for other people, and tend to use the words 'retarded', 'gay', and 'ghetto' when they mean 'stupid', 'inconvenient', and 'sloppy'."
"One of my favorite quotes is ""If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room."""

"It worked for my ex: the mother once clicked on a malware link and the browser crashed before installing the software. We called that the Valiant defense, based on the name of that ancient pos computer"
That seems contradictory. Insecurity stems from overanalyzing everything one does. So how could one do that while being incapable of self reflection?

"The irony is that some people who judge so much can not accept any form of criticism, and paint themselves as victims if anything bad is said about them. Like that South Park episode I saw, the one where the Jersey shore is invading America; this one lady goes on and on and on about the hairdresser's big ears, and Randy's wife's small chin, then when her own far apart eyes are pointed out, she gets defensive and completely loses her shit.   Its human nature, we all judge, consciously or subconsciously, and like the Golden rule: If we don't want to be judged in an unfair manner, then we shouldn't judge others in an unfair manner. Other people's perspectives let us see something in our behavior or our life that we hadn't seen before. Criticism is crucial, but we gotta learn how to give constructive criticism by toning down the judgmental aspect, and also learn how to accept criticism and not take it personally.   I'm not sure if I answered your friends' question right, but I hope you understand what I meant to say."

"&gt;What screams ""I'm very insecure""?  You shouldn't use 'very', it makes you look unintelligent. Mark Twain said that. I never use very. I even have a bi-weekly alarm set to check if the *""Words to replace 'very' with""* infographic has been posted to r/coolguides recently.  I am morose at your use of language. You definitely don't woo any women.  Edit: Apparently I'm very good at insecurity-roleplay.

"Being self-critical and self-reflecting are not necessarily the same thing. The former can often be completely unbalanced and, well, overly critical and not objective if you will.  The later seeks to honestly analyze yourself and your actions regardless of the results, abd doing so in a objective way (as much as possible).  The former being more negative and not seeking betterment, the later bring more positive and seeking betterment. That's my take anyway."

There was a crotch rocket festival in downtown Chicago last night at about 2am. All down the streets of the loop and River North. Probably lake shore drive. They like to come down here because their shitty motorcycles are extra loud when they rev up to 9000 RPM in between 50 story buildings.

"I think its absurd that some people go after allies of people they dont like. Basically you have people who disagree with LGBTQ generally based on ignorance who then say that people who do think LGBTQ people are fine are also bad. Its frankly confusing to me.   In the past it was basically everyone against LGBTQ people but now that's reversed and really I think it's important for some people to understand that If the majority of people disagree with you then figure out why that is rather than attacking people.  If you find a source in the bible that says homosexuality is bad then okay. However you must acknowledge that homosexual as a word was not included in the bible until I believe the 1960s. In truth the passage had originally been against pedophilia before being repurposed to be against homosexuality. And then if you decide to hate people because what the bible says you must follow it closely which most do not. You need to do things like not eating shrimp, not wearing clothing made of more than 1 material, and if you are a woman you shouldn't talk. None of those things are stuff that people who believe in the bible ever actually do though.   Its selective criticism and it's weird."

Why is that so hard?).  Feel the need to embarrass your housemates for missing a spot after doing chores  Use your breadcrumbs military experience as an excuse to treat your housemates like shit.  Say ""I was just raised differently"" to excuse you hurting someone rather than owning up to it and changing.  I can go on for a while but, basically it all boils down to being too afraid to hold yourself accountable, so afraid that nobody respects you that you feel the need to force it out of them, and having zero self-awareness to realize that you exhibit both of these god awful traits.

On the contrary though, I see little things about people and think how great it must be to have a quality like that and even if it's something simple, the person is held that much higher in my opinion.  Is this a sign of insecurity or realism or being weird? Not sure what to think of myself with this one."

"Having a big mouth in the class, grop chat, but not saying shit in class"
Apologizing for everything. It shows lack of confidence.
I probably would  be more competitive and want to prove it was left for me. Ha!
"I used to have a group of friends that all hated me for this reason. They would constantly talk shit about me and make up rumors.   When I asked the ringleader who also was my best friend why he did all that, he said it was because he's jealous of me.   I tried to reconcile and see the good in them but they all just couldn't stop hating on me.   So I told him he needs to stop being such a bitch and get over himself. Then I left and never looked back.   Fuck you and your mindless friends, Jeff. I wasted so much of my life trying to be your friend."

I'm in a play right now where I have to hold this one guy's hand at some point in a non-romantic way. The first time we ran the scene his girlfriend came right up to him afterward and held his hand and clung onto him to make sure I knew he was hers. He's 40+ years older than me.

I had a math team tournament recently and the cyphering was being watched by spectators. My anxiety made me cave and i worked much slower than i usually would. I got one of 20 points i could earn. My school still placed 2nd fir 7th grade, and individually i placed 6th place because of my hour test. Whoop."
I bragged about how my family was low income growing up. I still do that now... I guess I should stop.
"I know this can be much easier to say than it is to do but...  Honestly, the first sign of any behavior like that is a total red flag and I would probably end the relationship right there. I might give them one chance and have a discussion about it just to be sure, but that’s it.   I say this because I think many people think this kind of behavior is normal and is a natural part of a relationship. It’s not. People, seriously, get out of these awful relationships."

"LastPass is a popular and effective service. Look into password managers and pick one that works best for you. Many of them have a very effective free version, with a paid version for more intensive things like family or company password management. They often also have password generators that will create and store a totally randomized password for you, so that you dont have to worry about it.  Let me know if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as I can. I've used LastPass at a few companies I've worked for and now I use it myself, so I'm fairly familiar with that one."

"Step 1, be really insecure"
You probably feel nowhere close to that because you don’t trust your amazing intuitions. If you constantly doubt yourself ofc you won’t be as quick witted.

"I’m dealing with this right now with one of my boyfriend’s female friends.   I noticed other women in the friend’s circle wanted nothing to do with her, almost unfairly, and noticed how close she was with the guys. So it seemed like she had a lot of redeeming traits and things to like about her. Was it other women being jealous of this girl being close to their boyfriends?   Wrong. She’s just a cunt to women. Self-fulfilling prophecy at its finest."
"There was one girl I dated a number of years back. She was a grade behind me so i had just graduated high school. Young love right? Well we're driving and she says ""so do you want the unlock to my phone?""  I realized that this had been a requirement from her last few boyfriend's, one of which I knew to be a jealous controlling type. I told her I didn't want it because that's not the type of relationship I want. I have always and will continue to always hold that standard. No one's getting in my phone but I will also never Snoop through someone else's phone or computer. It destroys them and it destroys you."
"People who scream ""I'm very insecure"" would be part of it I guess ?"
"Had a friend who used to put me down and shit all the time, just seriously mean stuff , but only when we were around other people. Dude loved feeling good about himself when people laughed and that was the easiest way he knew how."

"Reminds me of my ex. He had a least one little negative thing to say about everyone.  It wasn't usually anything big, often just a nitpick or something minor, but as someone who tries hard not to judge people, it bugged me. He really isn't a happy guy, though he tries to present himself otherwise."
"Opposite, my wife couldn't read at the same age as others. Now she has read more books than anyone I know. They tried to put her in special ed."
There's an individual sub for each of those adjectives to be its own wet rage-dream on Reddit. :(

I can set it to strobe at different intervals.  It’s absolutely illegal. But it totally works and I haven’t got the cops called on me yet."
Trying to use words you don't really understand the meaning of to sound more intelligent....
"You know, yes, his reaction was pretty dumb and that's what jerks do but on the other side I feel bad for him because it says a lot about our society if people have to fear being looked down on because education did something wrong."

"Any situation where someone refuses to help or teach someone else how to do something because “hey, no one taught/helped me when I was starting out.” I see this in work environments all the time. To me that always seems like the person feels threatened or that they know deep down what they do isn’t that special and their only value is being the only one who knows how to do it for the time being."

"Eh, diceware passwords are all lowercase and can be made as strong as you need them to be by just adding more words. Diceware passwords are also much easier to remember and type because you are just typing words.  For example I just generated this seven word diceware password:  &gt;pavilion astronaut curse panama limpness crate sasquatch  You could easily make a nonsense sentence using these words that would be easier remember than a 14 random string like this one I just generated:  &gt;S#GYqi$8%}|gD,  Those two passwords have about the same amount of entropy 90.5 vs 92.0. Whether or not you think 90 bits is secure enough, it's definitely vastly more secure than what most people are using, even when forced to use mixed case, numbers, and symbols."
Being worried that you're insecure when you see this post so you check the comments

Not being able to simply admit you are wrong. I can't be the only person to Wright you off as not worth starting a discussion with when i notice this trait. So infuriating.
"It's also hilarious when people go too far the opposite way, like they are so insecure about what their kid isn't doing that they point out stuff that almost every kid can do as if that makes up for it. Such as, ""Well my child may be five and can't (whatever), but he is so full of smiles and loves to cuddle""."

"Just tailgaters in general suck. I speed a lot - but so does everybody else. Everybody going 10/20km/h over the speed limit is so common cops don't even bat an eye. So if somebody is up your ass, they wanna go 40+ over the limit. That nothing but *clearly* in asshole territory. And I'm not talking about highways - this is disgustingly common on all roads, even on 2-lane roads.  So every night here I am in the dark going 15 km/h over (which is already probably a bit too fast for conditions) and assholes will line up on my tailgate with their brights on waiting for oncoming traffic to clear to pass me. Most of the time I just keep at speed and let them pass.  But sometimes... if I get too pissed off at the shitty driving I've watched all day,  I decide to take their shitty inflated egos down a peg.   Good luck trying to pass a V8 Charger asshole :D"

Selfies. Too many selfies on one's social media accounts.
Can I ask about what type of therapy you got for this? My bf has tried many psychologists and just never sticks it out because he’s so complicated so it takes a while to get to know him. If I know what kind of therapy maybe I’ll have a place to start...
Okay that makes more sense. I went to a much larger school so the cliques were smaller if that makes sense? I had a class of like 500 kids so I literally never spoke to some of these people.  Also graduated 10 years ago so things were kind of different. Like we had cell phones but it was different I think. Idk I'm fuckin old now. 😂

Bumper stickers on their car (not just 1-2 on the bumper/rear window....all over the back), Logo stickers all over their skateboard, bicycle, and guitar. Also, refrigerator magnets and random tattoos.  Their whole life seemed to scream ""Please pay attention to me and the things I like"""

If you tell a story where you bought a car once that was 40.000 but the shittiest car you ever had, or you totaled it on your way home... now THAT is another good story!"

"I guess I got lucky then.  I used to be super insecure (mostly about my weight and physical appearance (i.e. everything)), and I used to lie about the stupidest shit.  I was pretty insular too, content with gaming and having a very small amount of friends (or none, sometimes).  Then I realized, despite everything that happened to me, I turned out pretty good and I shouldn't give a fuck about other people's opinions unless they're doing their best to look out for me (my best friend has my best interests at heart and she doesn't sugar coat shit).  So now, I'm all about honesty, even if it hurts (myself or others), because it'd hurt more if the lie got found out.  &amp;#x200B;  **EDIT**:  Didn't even realize I'd been given a Gold.

There's a good chance that people who label themselves as 'Incel' will be reading this, because by their very nature, they're insecure about themselves, women, life in general, etc.  I'm an older redditor (between 30 and 50) and I could have been considered an 'Incel' at several points in my life. Despite my weight, my genetics, my general appearance, I never let those things affect how I treat other people. I'm pretty much set in the idea that I'm done with whatever sexuality I might have had, but I have many good friends and made many good memories, despite all the horrible shit that's happened to me.  My advice to you, is better yourself before you start caring further about 'others'.  If your end goal is to 'get laid', you need to be 'sellable' to the other sex. You need to lose weight, need to further your education, you need to treat people better.  And I say that as someone who's doing all three. I'm working out almost every single day and losing fat/gaining muscle (without a trainer, without a fad diet. Just using moderation). I'm getting my college education (from home, where i'm more comfortable) and I'm trying my best to be more considerate of others by not being judgmental unless I'm given an explicit reason to judge (someone starts rumors about me, makes fun of my friends, etc).  But you've gotta do this shit for **you** and no one else. Stop losing yourselves into your games, stop losing yourself into the echo-chambers advocating 'incellness' and misogyny. If you don't have anyone in your life to make proud of you, look in the mirror and say 'I'm fuckin' proud of myself'.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT 2:     This applies to girls, women, females, and anyone, anywhere.  Regardless of your gender, nationality, creed, religion.  Love yourself, be proud of yourself, first and foremost."

"Jealousy... it’s a hateful emotion. I’m in love with my ex boyfriend still, it’s been 3 years of loving him, 1 year since our breakup. He is jealous of every move I make, whether I go out or not. I don’t know, he blocked me on everything and blocked some friends of ours just for posting a pic with me. There’s so many pics of him hooking up w other people, and I even became friends w them after. It just screams insecure from his behavior. To sum it up, there’s no need to be jealous. You can support those you love without tearing them. Listen to the feelings of those around you."

I hate mom groups. Everyone’s kid is a prodigy. I had one friend who’s baby was two weeks older than mine... she was constantly bragging about how advanced her baby was and the milestones she was reaching that was months ahead of her time. Total BS but she wanted everyone to believe she was the perfect mom. I think it stems from her being a foster kid and afraid that someone will think she’s not fit to be a mom from her family history.

For example has to rent instead buying a house, leasing a car instead of buying, etc."

"My friend says that he makes hundreds of pounds from streaming on twitch despite me and my friend found out he hasn't had a single donation before. He said to me that he's gonna buy 2 RTX 2080 Ti's for his PC. The cheapest I've found an RTX 2080 Ti is £800 so 2 of them would be £1600 (or around $2080).

Everyone stopped and stared at him, and one of our friends said ""because he asked her to??"" He said he just wanted to warn me and make sure I knew. My girlfriend said it just points out how insecure he is and that he cheats on all his girlfriends.   It's become a running gag now though in the group since that guy isn't there anymore, anytime someone's SO touches their phone we tell it out"

"This is the bane of my mom life.

I know now that these milestones are bullshit, but before that realization, I felt like such a failure... because my kid wasn’t potty trained at 18 months on the dot? How fucked up that we put these expectations on ourselves and our children so early. My 2 year old has been in physical therapy since she was 8 months old for low muscle tone, and I have been more open about the fears and the struggles that come from that, and many of my other mom friends have found it refreshing. The relief on their faces when they find that they can talk about their own parenting hardships without being judged around me is obvious.

Or they talk about how they’re taking the upcoming test to become a firefighter.   Or they talk about their side jobs that aren’t EMS.  It especially happens when the EMT is older than I am, and I know it comes from a place of “I need to justify why I’m still ‘just an EMT’”   And I get it, especially in an industry that can be as toxic as this one, but cmon people, as long as you do your job well and you’re easy to work with, I don’t care what acronyms you have after your name."

I've been writing since I was a kid""  ""Bro, I've studied acting for 7 years. I obviously know more than you""  He's very annoying, and he hates when someone gets more attention than him. I was editing a video and he happened to be besides me, a girl saw the video and said ""Woah, you're really good at editing!"" And this fucker came up and said ""I'm supervising, without me he wouldn't be near as good as he is""  Bitch I've been editing for ten years, I don't need your ass to be helping me, specially when you don't even know how to separate audio and video."

My 20 year old lives at home and goes to community college, which is also lovely, and I'm so proud. Your 12 year old is a sports star and taking algebra in 6th grade? Fantastic.

I'm not saying she did it for attention, cause I don't 100% know. but it had only been one fucking week after. she also fakes depression and anxiety cause I have it, (i was diagnosed by a professional doctor) and as you guessed it, she wasn't. this doesn't mean she is insecure, it's just that I think she is, and yes I have talked to my parents about it, all they say is that ""oH yOu ShOuLd Be FlAtTeRed"" no I shouldn't.   tl;dr: what screams insecure to me is faking mental illness, and trying to be someone's twin."

"I started casually dating this guy. Things are going pretty well and after a few good dates, it seems like the feelings shared between us that we’re both into one another are mutual. We talk about it and he says he’d like to take things slowly. He also tells me that he’s casually seeing someone else. While it stings a little, I choose to believe he’s being honest with me and we haven’t had a discussion about exclusivity. We agree to keep things casual, that we like each other, and to spare one another the grizzly details of our time with other people, so long as we’re being safe and honest with one another.   A weekend comes and he doesn’t make plans with me. I don’t make plans with him either, because I know he’s got some stuff going on. Since we talked about seeing other people, I make plans on Friday night for a date with another guy. We go out, it’s fun, I enjoyed his company. The next morning, who texts me but this bro who just wanted to keep things casual. He tells me that last night some girl tried to sneak into his bed 🙄 but he told her no because ‘he only lets select people into his environs’ like me. He doesn’t want me thinking he just sleeps around with anyone. Okay man, cool story. Thanks for sharing with the rest of the class. Insecure party of one?"

I don't think you have to wait until 9 - my daughter is 6 and has a bestie from preschool, and there's constant stories about what they want for Christmas (slow your roll, it's not even Halloween), she has some other friends that like to do monkey bar tricks with her, there's a frienemy that we keep running into at camps, etc ... she seems to have quite the social life already!  Random other example, she made up a quiz game for My Little Pony, and I was totally crushing my wife on Pony names. So my daughter started whispering the correct answers to my wife so she could catch up. It was ridiculous and hilarious.  But yeah, the toddler years can suck it."
Same hear. I was also afraid of her for some reason.

"Partially yeah. Someone that is in an abusive relationship has a legitimate reason to feel scared—I’ve been there a couple times.  But the type of person I mean is, for example, two people that aren’t abusive towards one another but stay in a relationship that everyone sees is dead/loveless because being alone seems scary, even though it may be better in the long run.  Or their job is sucking all the emotional and mental energy out of them, pays crap, the boss is abusive etc but they don’t even try to find another job.  I think nearly everyone has been there. It’s hard to get out of."

"Dude just stop, they're intentionally pissing you off. If you can keep that truck going the 200k miles with the better fuel efficiency, and save yourself the bigger carbon footprint that buying new cars makes, then do it. My old diesel mercedes has nearly 300k miles on the clock, with the EGR deleted, muffler cut off, a simpler intake, and I even removed my fuel regulator so that the engine gets exactly the amount fuel I want it to when I put my foot down. These guys can fuck off."

Also almost verbatim. It's like dude, stop. It's unfortunate."
"1) considering he literally said he wanted to work to reintroduce the 1994 AWB, that wasn't an entirely unreasonable belief at the time  2) owning guns and not wanting the government to take them does not make you a ""racist ass-backwards redneck"" and is nowhere near being similar to believing women and African Americans shouldn't be allowed to vote lmfao"

"Luckily most people have the capabilities to control it themselves   The path is difficult if not seemingly impossible, but for the most part it’s bullshit our own minds have us believe. We are in control of our emotions. Remove yourself from the situations that are causing you to fall back. Take care of yourself consistently and actively have conversations with yourselves about what you’re doing to do, and actually do those things.   The battle may seem endless, but depression is largely a problem when people are too ingrained into consumer culture. Most humans aren’t built for consumer culture 24/7. A lot of things that people believe they want are made up to sell you a certain lifestyle.   What really brings you happiness? Find that. And never stop searching. You will begin to finding happiness in so many things."

"My sister has a hard time with insecurity and low self-esteem, this tends to make her the loudest person in the room. She also makes a big deal everytime she sees me by squealing and running to give me a hug whilst professing how much she missed me. Sadly it's actually fake (but it garners attention from the people around her) and she then tries to humiliate me in front of people as much as possible.  But I think she's getting better with it; she's enrolled in a new degree and she's taking herself out of environments where she feels less than herself and trapped, I hope she does succeed because when she tones it down she can be really lovely."
My ex did that she lied about getting pregnant even though we never had sex (we were 15 at the time)

"Talking about ""alpha"" and ""beta"" behaviour"
What’s a girl?
Maybe. Nobody I know thinks it’s funny either.
My best friend in jr high used to do this and make everything about her and how “great” she was....  in high school everyone hated her and she has no real friends because of this toxic quality. My current best friend of 5 years is also starting to do this now to make up for her lack of popularity and success... it’s made being her friend very hard recently
I'm like that when people compliment me as well. It's like I don't think they could possibly mean it.
I'm insecure because I'm checking the comments to see if I do any of these things.
Bullying other kids for no reason
"I feel like the worst one for mums like these and the most confusing thing to me are when they tell people their child can read Harry Potter! While I enjoy the story, I’ve never understood the appeal for wanting your young child to read Harry Potter or believe that they understand the concepts in Harry Potter. They are just reading the words but don’t understand the plots. Just wait until they are older!"

"I completely deleted mine about a year ago.  Its been great to be honest.  Only seeing people's ""highlight reel"" made it really tough for me when I was going through some rough times.  The only people I lost contact with were people I didn't really care about anyway, most actual friends and I keep up with texts, phone calls, and actually hanging out."

I don't think I'm a mean spirit 😟
"i think that maybe what u/itsacalamity was referring to (this is just a guess) are the social and environmental factors that can impact eating habits, like the environment they were raised in, the money/time they have, if they live in a food desert and don't have access to a variety of 'good foods', or even if they may have an eating disorder accompanied with unhealthy eating habits. Everyone *does* have the ability to change how they eat (you're definitely not wrong), but maybe (? again, not sure) what OP was talking about are some external factors that can definitely act as barriers for people. Like if they have issues in their life that are top priority, their own weight (and other self-care issues) probably aren't high up on the list."
Tenerife? Oh I know Tenerife! That's where they invented the Boeing 1494-- a mashup of two Boeing 747's.
"That's the thing, we would love to take action, especially me after what he's done, but he's had like 9 concussions and another hit to the head might seriously fuck him up or even worse. I was held back from hitting him by others when he punched me. There's gotta be another way to teach him he can't do the things he does and get away with it"
Lol you're right they think you're flexing on them and shit
"""I remember going to college"" your sample may be slightly biased."

"I see this question a lot on reddit. The Confederate flag is not about the civil war anymore. For these people, it is a masculine symbol of ""rebelliousness"" and ""anti-authority"". For others, it also emphasizes a supposed connection to ""Southern"" identity.

"When someone screams the sentance ""I'm very insecure"""
"I think  the main problem is that as soon as a comment goes hidden due to low score, people suddenly feel the need to be rude to you, even if you didn't say anything hateful or really that controversial.  For example, if there is a one directional circle jerk and you put up a balanced argument, it will quite often get a lot of upvotes and downvotes at first. The second it hits minus 5, however, it accelerates down and the verbal abuse starts flowing in.  I think the people who dish out this kind of verbal abuse on the basis of the downvotes rather than the content of the comments are extremely insecure; thus, I get back on topic in this thread."

"One of the worst people I knew for doing this was a girl I went to school with. A mutual friend’s mother had breast cancer, and when the (obviously upset) mutual friend told one-up girl she said “oh that’s nothing, my father’s had cancer like four times”, and then changed the subject to herself. Her father was Australian and I think he honestly had had skin cancer in the past, though probably not that many times, but still, what the fuck kind of response is that?"
Ahahaha if he'd been here for that he'd need some kind of ice pack for that burn
Whistling in the locker room. You might as well say 'I'm fighting a battle with my homosexual tendencies'.

"My mothers favorite story about me was when I was starting to sentences together somewhat regularly. We were in the car with my aunt who had your reasonable amount of road rage.  Someone cut her off and she apparently didn't say anything about it. I guess she usually did say something because according to both if them I chimed in. ""Aunt Deb are gonna call them fuckin asshole?"" .   Now that I am grown up this seems like a reasonable thing to boast about because lil baby me did not yet have too much anxiety to call an asshole driver an asshole.

"Two things about this:  I think if one upping with a funny/good/dour/etc. story happens all the time or they have to lie to make it seem better, then yeah it's insecurity. But telling a funny story that's better than the last isn't necessarily insecure. It just happens that the conversation naturally continued in that direction."
"A need to put people down to feel better about yourself.  In a romantic relationship, or even friendship, being controlling and possessive. It suggests you don't like yourself, don't understand why they like you, and are afraid of them realising they don't."
"Yea no way I would know all that if there were 500 kids in my class lmao. Definitely helps that I graduated like 4 years ago so phones and social media were super prevalent.

I had a friend that was like this; our husbands worked with a woman (who was very clearly and openly a lesbian); my friend was incredibly insecure about this woman even talking with our husbands. She would start fights with her husband over her and tell me all about it...like dude calm down she is far more likely to be interested in you then your husband. It was actually awful to watch.

"Always having to talk about how Alpha you are. If you have to continuously tell others you’re an Alpha, guess what, you’re not. He who must declare himself “King”, is no king. True “Alphas” don’t need to declare it. People pick up on that shit intrinsically. They pick up on the leadership qualities, and the way you treat people. The way you can put others before yourself, but still lead and encourage, and be in charge/control. Having to declare how alpha you are, or brag about things to seem alpha are the opposite of alpha"
"A couple years ago my cousin had a breakup. They were only together a few months so the family only met the girl once or twice.

"I'm very insecure in my relationships. I just got called a stage 5 clinger because I text my GF and she didn't respond. I waited about 3 hours and asked if everything is alright. I'm constantly sure she is going to dump me and it terrifies me. I'm a 40 year old man with a teenage son and an OK job. I know intellectually that getting dumped by someone I have only been dating a few months is not the end of the world, but every time I think about it I get sick. I don't think she's cheating on me, she's got a 1 year old son and is just busy. I don't know why I can't shake this feeling of dread."
Fucking tragic isn't it.  Insecure angry underachievers trying to sound like confident intimidating free thinkers. Truly pitiful to watch.

"Almost 2 years ago an ex friend and I were having a heart to heart basically and I said that I have had a lot of issues with depression over the years and being suicidal and all that and her first response was “I’ve literally held a knife to my throat.” Like okay, congrats at the suicide++  It wasn’t an “Oh I’ve been there before, it’s okay” kind of thing either, she worded it exactly like that and looked at me like I was supposed to be impressed or have some kind of huge reaction.

I felt so bad for him, and gave him a high five and appraise when we crossed paths later.  Anyway, when running my lap, i ran past this fucker *walking* the 4km.

"I actually disagree with this one. I’m a female and all my close friends (inner most circle) are guys except for two of them. All my friendships with the guys are effortless. They keeps my secrets, they aren’t catty, they don’t talk shit behind each others’ backs, they don’t gossip, never get mad at me for irrational things like not talking to or texting them for 2 days, and they don’t require an excessive level of emotional support. My female friendships are a lot of work, especially for someone like me who isn’t an emotional person. I love them, but I honestly find hanging out with them and other females draining. Girls do tend to be “all drama” because they fucking gossip and gossip leads to drama. I’m not insecure, I just hate a lot of inherently female social behavior."

"Vista was the .0 release of the NT6 kernel, it introduced a new driver model, new security model, and changed a lot of the underlying system.

Dude stuck his dick in almost every woman he met, always went after females that looked like little girls, got three STDs over time, never told any of them about any of the diseases but fixed himself by going to the doc, and insists everyone else in the world is a liar, manipulator, and pervert yet he's the lolicon deceiver that also ironically insists that doctors are a scam yet when he had STDs he couldn't fix with his hippie bullshit he had no choice but to get help from docs."

Bragging about your professional life and workplace accomplishments constantly. If you worked hard and got a raise or something and you rub it in your friends face as a joke and you all go to the pub and have a good time then cool but bragging constantly is just annoying and insecure as hell.

"Rolling coal violates the Clean Air Act, which is a federal law. The trucks are often modified to pass emissions tests in the counties that require them. It's also against the Texas Transportation Code. Section 547.605 says it's an offense if someone knowingly emits ""visible smoke that remains suspended in the air for 10 seconds or longer before dissipating."" It's about a $300 ticket for your first offense, and around $1000 each time afterwards."

I read a study about people that sit with their hand on their neck are usually insecure or nervous

He's constantly fussing over his go bag and everyday carry loadout despite living in the suburbs and having a union or otherwise benign job. He votes primarily based on NRA PFV grades, lets everyone know he's carrying, fantasizes about being the good guy with a gun or shooting someone breaking into their home, experiences extreme anxiety or anger when entering carry free zones, wears soft body armor to his niece's christening, and thinks it's totally rational to openly threaten bodily harm against people that don't agree with him.  I know because I used to *kinda* be him. Guns are cool and it's not unreasonable to want to protect yourself, but folks that become very obsessive and militant about it are motivated by fear and insecurity."
I do this but only when someone asks me if I have/ever had a girlfriend. I have a made up story that I use every time and made it consistent over the years. I am obviously very insecure about that aspect of my life.
"This is a grad school story. I joined a PhD program and the first six months was basically getting acquainted with the topic. There was another guy who was in the same lab and started his PhD a year before me. I was getting trained by him and from the little interaction I had with him seemed like he was a friggin genius . Would keep going about how complex his code is, how hard is work is and the ease with which he is doing it. He had already published two papers. His experimental results were unbelievably good and he was the star of the University, won a few travel grants. He would one up me in every lab meeting and talk down to me and the other lab people. All of this got me really suspicious and I once asked him for some raw data which he refused to share. Coincidentally, some of the PhD students from other universities he was collaborating with also got suspicious and they mislabeled the data sets and sent it for analysis. This guy however still managed to produce the correct results. He was busted!!! This was an NIH funded project and the bugger panicked. Replaced all experimental data with computational data to hide his tracks. Little did he realise that the collaborators had back up for the experimental data and now the real experimental data dint match with his experimental data. This escalated, after which I confided with my advisor about my opinion also. The extent to which he fabricated data was unbelievable and for what? We dug even deeper and turned out , he would basically steal code from the collaborating lab and claim it to be his. He basically stole my code, passed it on to my advisor as his and when got busted , he said that he was using my code. Next thing you know, he is claiming racism and wants to go back to India where he feels more safe. I'm Indian too!!! And never even once have I experienced outright racism. Now he works in Indian in a hydroponics company . Managed to getaway Scott free and I basically spent two years in a lab idolizing this guy and thinking I was a dumb ass. Academia is pure mental masturbation!!!"

I don't take joy in it, but I do teach my kids to value the fruits of their labors and not just the shit they can graft from friends and family."

Constantly shitting on what people like and making them feel bad for liking things.  You can say you don't like something. But it's another thing to try and shit on someone for liking something you don't as long as it's not hurting anyone.   Liking things is good. It makes you happy. Why try and limit what you like to seem cool? And why try and limit what other people can like just so you seem superior?   I'm sad when I don't like something because that's something that I'm missing out on that could bring me joy.
"Band nerd here. Sometimes when the goods are odd, the odds are good."
I often wonder if folks like that are perhaps just a bit socially inept with a dash of narcissism rather than insecure. To many folks life really is a game that they want to play and tell themselves they are winning.
"Ooph. This one gets me. I had a really bad internship experience that (I literally just realized) damaged my self-confidence. Well, more like destroyed.   When I got my first job, it was in a side field. I was good. Not humble bragging, but I was *good*. Several people in the main field (medical) commended and knew me. I was too scared to apply at that facility and felt it would be overreaching to ask them to put in a good word.   I quit my job to take a break. My husband is encouraging me to get a license in the side field- but again, I’m scared I won’t be able to cut it."
"My mom is also a pathological liar.  I picked up some bad habits from it.  I never got to the point where I was as bad as she is.    In grade school a friend asked me why I was so good at lying.  I didn’t have an answer, but it stuck with me and made me see what was happening.  I still catch myself thinking of a fabricated “story” to tell someone.  I have to stop and think why am I making this up.  It’s f’n weird, and just one of my challenges."
"AMEN! The wife of one of my husband's good friends is pregnant, and last night we were talking about a baby shower vs. ""diaper party"", which I've never heard of before. Baby showers are primarily sitting around and playing dumb games with people I don't know and watching someone I like but am not close to open presents. The diaper party is for men (in this friend group they're the ones I know) get to bring a pack of diapers and half out and drink. I immediately asked to go to that one instead because hot damn, does it sound like more fun."

Should I have done something else?"" It's a very draining world that my insecurity has created for me :("

One of the problems in today's society is we don't tell people when they're doing something wrong so we end up with tons of misbehaviors that annoy and endanger

Humble bragging
"I knew a guy who could compete with your guy. That’s right, I’m one upping your one upper /s  He once said that he got in a car chase with the cops on a dirt road. He escaped them by pulling the emergency brake and doing a 360 at like 100 mph. This threw dirt up in the air, giving him invisibility, and he was able to keep the car perfectly straight on the road the entire time.  This strategy worked so well, he did 360’s continuously down the road.   Does this guy sound like his name is Joey?  His name is Joey.  Edit: For those of you asking: He did really say a 360, not 180. Also, the car was supposedly a Dodge Neon. This was about 12 years ago when he said this probably."

A few kids at my school committed suicide a while back. The mood was as somber as it should be, the topic was touchy for about a month and a half, then the usual ""shit, that's embarrassing, might as well kill myself"" jokes started rolling out. I accidentally let one if those loose next to the brother of one of the kids.  I haven't made a joke like that openly for the past 3 years because of the conversation I had with him after that."

"&gt;Using your internal fear as a reason not to do something.  Unfortunately, this defines me to a T. I think it started with not standing up to bullies, not wanting to get my ass kicked (I've always been a weakling, and besides standing up for myself, I don't mind it). Now I'm just a punching bag who doesn't give a damn about himself (even though I'm trying) because I'm afraid of everything that will go wrong if I try to improve my life. Just this year, I started grad school, to better myself and succeed in life. Completely different coursework than my major in undergrad (studying business/finance now vs undergrad was history). And guess what? No matter how hard I try, I'm not doing as well as I'd hoped, and might be able to continue school next semester. So I may very well have taken another risk, wasted a year of my life, and added ~$30k worth of student loans... All for nothing.  At least when I listen to my internal fear I don't have to deal with the failure that is my life..."

"I may be wrong, but it seems to me that celebrities who post photos of themselves over and over and over and over on their random accounts...I just can’t be convinced they are healthy. I suppose they are brilliant if they do it as a means to collect more cash, but in most cases it just screams insecurity. Kardashians, that model married to John Legend, etc. And those who are now so proud of being overweight. Why is that cool?  Some people who are overweight are theoretically healthy, maybe if you are an offensive lineman who runs a lot to the point they are in better aerobic shape than thin people, but the truth of the matter is that most overweight people, the vast majority, are unhealthy and this will lead directly to diabetes and who knows what other diseases?  So for these people to put pictures of their excess weight in detail on their sites...I think it is just a strange way of demonstrating insecurity. And now since society has no right or wrong or good and bad, our media praises all of it. I saw Demi Lovato (another celebrity who is a celebrity for some reason only known to those under 25) posting photos of cellulite very up close. Why is that so awesome?  She’s a pretty girl, not fat at all,  but why do we need to celebrate what anyone on earth would say is not particularly attractive?  That is what we all know, but we all feel pressure to say it’s great and honest and cool. No, it just sucks. Everyone has it, but just because it exists doesn’t mean we should celebrate it. We all defecate. Should celebrities all post the toilet bowl after defecating?  Poopproud#."

"My wife’s best friend’s fiancé is very insecure. The girls went to a movie, and apparently he texted her keeping tabs throughout the whole movie. She’s visited our place before and I’ve seen the amount he texts when she’s just here for an hour or so. He’s a nice guy, just super insecure as far as I can tell."
"When someone screams, ""I'm very insecure!"" do they not seem secure?"
"Me, I do."
I've met pathological liars before and I always believed there was no saving them... glad to hear you got out.  (Unless this is another lie...?)

"Yes, thinking that this gives someone power over me… Your money and infrastructure have been important… ‘til now."
"What about ""fabricated evidence?""  Here are some reasons that an ex of mine ""proved"" that I was cheating on her:  * I gave the waitress direct eye contact when placing my order * Waving another car to go ahead of me in a parking lot. (""People don't just DO that. You must be sleeping with her or something."") * Asking a waitress stupid questions which is clearly flirting, and why don't you just give her your number while you're at it.  Examples of stupid flirty questions:    * Can I have Monterey Jack cheese on that instead of cheddar? (""What are you trying to prove? Are you trying to look more sophisticated or something by ordering different cheese?"")    * Is your Blue Cheese dressing chunky or creamy?    * (when offered an option) ""I don't really know -- what do you suggest? I've never been here before."" * Not discussing the fact that I was dating her in every single conversation. By not doing so, clearly I was trying to come off as single.   Umm, sometimes it just doesn't come up. She expected all interactions to go something like this:   ""Hello, how can I help you?""   ""Yes, I'd like to return these pants please, I bought the wrong size. Oh, and just so you know I do have a girlfriend.""   or ""Can I help you?""  ""Yes, I had pump #2, $15.73, and I'm not single."" * Doing anything at all that involved even the slightest notion of privacy. This includes:    * having a phone conversation with a friend about his personal problems (""you need to have these calls on speaker so that I know what's going on in your life,"")    * Closing the door when in the bathroom/shower. Not even locking (which was forbidden.) Closing it to the point where it clicked closed. Because clearly you're hiding something.    * Putting ANYTHING away.  (""What's that? I see you sneaking that into your hiding place!"" ""Um, no, it's a receipt from my last oil change, I'm putting it in the file cabinet under Auto Maintenance.""   ""Oh yeah right, you were awful quick to make sure it wasn't sitting out on your desk, there's probably a girl's phone number on it.""  (snatches paper, sees that service writer was a woman, calls dealership and reams out said service writer and forbids me to visit said dealership for future service because she was just ""a little TOO good at pretending she didn't know who I was or what she was talking about."") * ""Lies of Omission.""  This one happened a few times.Her: (while rummaging through my cupholders/console in car ""What did you have for lunch yesterday?""me: ""Umm, chicken sandwich?""Her: ""Liar. LIAR!  I have RIGHT HERE a receipt saying you had and I quote, a deluxe chicken sandwich, curly fries, and a chocolate shake. THAT is a lie of omission and that CLEARLY means you have been hiding things from me all along, otherwise you would have recited that lunch order VERBATIM from memory."" * Changing my mind on anything mid-flight or running an unauthorized/undiscussed errand.  ""I have to run to Target to get something.""  (driving along, passing hardware store and realizing ""oh, I can just pick it up here and not deal with the lines and parking lot at the mall."")  Return home with a bag from True Value.  ""YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO TARGET AND YOU BRING HOME \*THIS?\*  Where ELSE did you go? DID YOU STOP BY SOME OTHER GIRL'S PLACE?????""  Want me to go on?

"People who get overly defensive about the stupidest and/or smallest things, even when it has nothing to do with them.   Storytime:  When I was in high school I was a shy quiet kid that hated confrontation. I was in choir with a bunch of other kids some I did not like at all but I tried to stay out of trouble.   One day the teacher told us to get up on the high risers and stand in positions as if we were on stage ready to preform. I am short so I was in the front and behind me were two girls that I did not get along with very much. One girl was very popular white girl and the other was the stereotypical 'ghetto' girl (sorry if I offended anyone with that word but that's the only way I can think to correctly describe her behavior and attitude).   While I was waiting for the teacher to come out yeah I felt a light tap on my head. I turned around and the two girls were acting like nothing happened so I figured it was my imagination. It happened again. I turned around again and the girls are acting like nothing happened again. I tried to ignore it and talk to my friend beside me and I get poked in the head again harder this time.   I finally turn around and tell both the girls that whoever did it to please stop. I was polite and didn't accuse either one just told them ""whoever did it to please stop"" my exact words. I later found out that it was the white girl but the 'ghetto' girl got extremely defensive and started yelling at me in my face telling me not to accuse her of doing something.   Basically just getting very defensive over something she supposedly did not do and she wanted to fight me she kept saying ""you want to fight, you want to fight"". I tried to tell her again that I was not accusing her of anything just that whoever did it to please stop but she kept acting on trying to fight me. I was not going to have it whatsoever so I stepped off of the risers and went to sit back in my chair.   Apparently that wasn't enough for her and she tried to pick a fight with my friend that was standing beside me but shes like me did not like confrontation and came to sit next to me in her chair. Her older brother was in the same class/in the room and saw the 'ghetto' girl trying to fight his little sister and decided to confront her.   My friends brother and the 'ghetto' girl started fighting. At first just yelling and then the girl tried to throw a punch at the older brother. He did not discriminate against man or woman so if someone tries to hit him he will hit back no matter who they are so that's what he did. Security had to be called and they were both taken outside to the hall separated."
"Being overly pessimistic about everything. “Hating” everything that is new to you and have strong opinions about things you don’t know anything about. When 99% of the things that leave your mouth are negative comments, I feel like you’re projecting."
"This will get buried likely but I want everyone to stop, think, and realize that people are insecure for a reason, typically related to childhood/adolescent events, traumas, etc.   Try to be kind to people who are insecure if you can and help them work through it if possible. Coax them out of that little hole they've dug themselves into."
"I used to be friends with a guy who would lie so much that me and a couple other people who knew him genuinely think he’s mentally ill.  Like I’ve come across people who make up some dumb lies and think they can get away with it, but this dude just lied so much and would even change his personality depending on who he recently hung out with. It’s like he had no personality of his own and it was so weird."

"Ragging on other people's appearance.   I love my in-laws, but they do this quite often when watching TV. Just constantly shit talking women on TV shows and I know it's because they are really insecure about their own appearance (obese and multiple health issues). I used to do it too when I was younger, but thankfully with age and accepting and loving myself, I stopped doing it."
"Pointlessly loud cars. Like damn, put the muffler back on my dude."
"This one I struggle with. Not because I'm insecure, frankly, I couldn't care less what other people think of me. But I do suck at socializing. One of the ways I try to carry on conversation is by taking other people's stories they tell and finding a related one from my life and telling them that to help them get to know me better in something they find interesting.  I work to find a good balance of listening, asking them questions about things they had mentioned, and relating things to my experiences without getting into one-upping territory or questionnaire territory. Still not very good at it, but I'm working on it."
Stay in school kid.
"Honestly, I think most people start out trying to do that. But I think there's a growing subset of people who strategically take advantage of this by demanding we get 'both sides' and 'more information' purely to exhast everybody, all under the guise of ""fairness"", to the point that one has enough energy for a normal conversation after and actually shies away from getting more info - or even participating at all - next time. Slowly but surely, less and less people are there to fairly ask about both sides."
People who try just way too hard. Always have to have something to say about everything and they're always right and can't admit they're wrong and are always better than you.
One of my good friends pursued a doctorate in mathematics because he wanted to prove to the world how smart he was. He admitted it to me while drunk one night. Claimed he actually hated math but it was the smartest sounding thing he could think of. He ended up dropping out and moving away before he could finish his doctorate...
"My ex and I had this joke when one of us got a text or something (for example) we’d narrow our eyes suspiciously and say: *who’s “Mom”*?? In an exaggerated jealous voice.

He actively holds his remaining friends back by inviting them over to 'be productive' and then forcing them to watch YouTube videos and not really accomplish anything. He's a man child who is aware that everyone is moving on in their life but him, and so sabotaging them, lying about having ambitions and worst of all, trying actively to get those of us who are actually working on our dreams to glue his name and credits to our creative accomplishments is how he does things.

"Where do you draw the line between this and simply relating to someone? I feel like oftentimes I worry I come off as trying to one up someone, where really I’m just trying to relate to the person.

Is this socially acceptable?"

"That is interesting. I consider myself very insecure, to a point I was convinced I have some kind of social phobia. But I don't find myself in any of the answers here that are currently voted the highest.   So here are the first 10 other forms of insecurities that come to my mind.  1. Not talking when in groups of people. 2. Stopping to talk when someone has a different opinion. 3. Stuttering. 4. Sweating. 5. Not expressing true opinions but figuring out what people like and trying to be that way. 6. Not taking part in social activities with co-workers. 7. Leaving parties without saying goodbye. 8. Talking only to known people and avoiding talking to anyone else. 9. Accepting unfair behaviour. 10. Faking a mobile phone call to avoid talking to people."

"I grew up with three older sisters, and honestly they're the nicest, non-judgey women I know (my mom is a sweetheart as well). I grew up expecting all females to be like that, but I pretty much found completely the opposite in the majority of them.   Guys are just chiller, and they're direct with what they want. Girls are more prone to talking in circles with themselves and with each other (""tell so-and-so to tell so-and-so""), and the over-sensitivity, gossiping, and rumors drive me crazy.   Most of my close friends are indeed guys, and the handful of girls I hang around with are very chill/direct/kind. I always worry about hurting girls' feelings with my jokes, so I just prefer to be around guys who don't take everything so seriously."

"The original person said ""probably cheating"" and I think a better response would have been ""thats not always the case"" rather than saying not usually the case. A lack of trust/always suspecting the other of cheating could just be a history of being cheated on or them not trusting their partner because they themselves are cheating. I think both reasons are possible there's no way to know which one it is. I dont know if there actually are proper statistics for *why* people lack trust in a relationship but there are many reasons for it, no reason to assume one reason here."

He wasn't attractive, and was super insecure, and never seemed to be able to prove that any of these girls existed.  He also got caught lying when he told our group of friends that his stepdad had passed away, soaked up all the sympathy, and then got busted a few weeks later when his stepdad called while we were all hanging out.  He was out of the group after that."

Any time I post my opinion about something different from her Christian beliefs,  I can expect her to chime in,  ""Well *actually* the Bible says xyz"" and it's usually a gross misinterpretation. Though she is the same person that brags about how smart she is, but when she wanted to be a lawyer she failed her bar exam the maximum amount of times allowed.    Funny because I was helping her study and I would get the answers right and I don't even know shit about no law, just seemed like commom sense, not that it matters, but I think it REALLY pissed her off that she was trying so hard and failing. I didn't have the heart to tell her that she lacked the necessary intelligence. I'm not like that. I would never put someone down so I just kept my mouth shut and tried to be supportive.    Now I guess, she takes it out on religious posts because shen thinks she's the be all end all personal mouthpiece for Jesus Christ. It's really fucking annoying. It's like, no one cares. You don't have to prove your intelligence to anyone. Just do you, ya know? Life isn't a competition.  Edit: Spelling because I make mistakes and I'm not afraid to admit it."

"Not sure if other people notice these things, but judging from what I do; trying to keep everyone as a friend, finding it very difficult to say no to people, and always apologising.

Not always the things that some other comments say, like trying to get attention or one-upping people. Sometimes we just try to hide it as best as possible, but on the inside we're scared. Of everything, mostly other people and their judgement."

"Hits all the familiar notes for me. I’ve had conversations with Reform and Conservative Jews who make a similar delineation with gay relationships (as well as to meticulous observance of all 613 instructions of Torah). From the historical analysis, Levitical laws against sodomy were designed to put a stop to an Ancient Near East form of hazing. In the Second Temple period (200BC-70AD), they were adapted to criticize the Greco-Roman practice of pederasty (teacher-student pedophilia). After the destruction of the Temple and formation of the Jesus movement, these scriptures were lumped together with others criticizing wanton sex, gluttony, and any other destructive or maladaptive behavior, with a countercultural attitude toward the Roman zeitgeist.   Selective criticism... Oh yeah! Repackaged, rewritten, and reinterpreted over thousands of years —  responding to a multitude of different issues."

"Bringing up the same topic over and over again.   Insecure about their finances? Evertime you overhear someone talking about purchasing something, force yourself into the conversation and try to convince that person, that they don't need it. (Well, I don't need underwear, nobody ever sees it anyway)  Insecure about your intelligence? Everytime you hear someone say that something does/doesn't exist say: ""So does God""; everytime you hear someone talks about their religion bring up basic knowledge about Greek mythology. Or showing off your extensive knowledge in one field while not knowing anything about everything else.  Insecure about your masculinity?

Talk about banging anyone who they find remotely attractive, and avoiding others"

"i have an ex friend who would flaunt EVERYTHING HE OWNED. got a new wallet? “y’all broke bitches wish you had this” (it was fucking Guess but ok). just got engaged? “y’all aren’t married because you’re fucking ugly maybe if you looked like me you would have a man” (no, i’m not engaged because i’m 16).   basically, he was very insecure about EVERYTHING. and i’ve known this dating back to like, 7th grade. he would make fun of anyone skinnier than him because he wanted to feel good about being obese. i was one of his targets.   he LOVED to show everyone his bank account, funded by his dad and a sugar daddy, whenever anyone criticizes him for not actually working for his money and still bragging about it, he says “literally fuck off y’all just mad jealous because you’re broke as fuck”   i stopped being his friend a while ago because he was just such an asshole and i knew that i couldn’t even help him.   anyway, extreme bragging and pulling others down SCREAMS insecurity."

"Also just the fact that grad school is often little more than institutionalized bullying. The shit that many higher level academics get away with in terms of how they treat their grad students is insane, and no one cares to change the culture because “I had to deal with it, so suck it up and get over it.”  And then people wonder why grad students have [much higher rates](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/) of mental health problems than the general population."

"They aren't capable of seeing how their behavior impacts their circumstances and relationships. They aren't able to identify the reason they behave a certain way and can't develop/mature as a person.  Ex: A person who gets into a lot of fights, they are constantly losing jobs and ending up in legal trouble.   If they practice introspection they may realize that they are violent because of their childhood and that they don't have to let their past taint their future. They learn to recognize when they are getting mad and how to walk away before it ever becomes physical."

Same here and from the mom. I spent the first 20 years of my life lying my ass off to people to make myself or my life seem more interesting or cool. The stupid lies I told. I'm glad I realized eventually that that's not the way to be.

"Nobody is blaming, chances are her mother raised her to be like this; always please men and see other girls as competition and is as toxic and damaging as father's raising boys to be into sports, never cry, be aggressive cause that's what ""real man"" do.

Treating other people poorly for no particular reason.  I didn't realize this until I reached my 30's...people who are regularly jerks on a daily basis tend to be jerks because they are insecure about their own feelings and emotions.  They have to bring down others to try and level out their own fears and anxieties.

Hey bud I'm the same way. I'm approaching 30 now and have had two jobs since high school. Stayed with both of them for around 4 years each and was miserable the whole time. Recently I was fired and it's the best thing that ever happened to me because I was forced to go through the interview process. I start my new job Monday.  Just do it. Start putting in a few job applications a week for practice and take interviews for practice. You are never required to accept an offer. It's better to make this change on your own terms instead of being forced like I was. You never know what opportunities are out there.

A scenario: a guy and a girl are talking at the bar, and in walks Mr. Insecure Douchebag.  He gets so flustered at the fact that there’s a girl talking to someone else besides him. So instead of finding his own girl, he goes to the girl who is clearly in mid conversation with another guy, and starts trying to chat her up. Guy tells him to fuck off, douche nozzle starts to act all big and tough and acts like he’s ready to throw down. Girl gets creeped out and leaves.   We have all met people like this, and there are many other ways of being insecure besides this. This is just what comes to mind for me."

"There's a Buddhist saying that goes something like this: ""the world is a mirror"" (in which you see yourself reflected back at you) I added the parenthesis for clarity   If someone steals, they will think everybody else steals. If somebody is genuinely nice and altruistic, they will assume everybody else is too by default. I think ""assume"" is the wrong word here, because it becomes your default perception of reality and in that way it literally becomes your perceived reality.  Really, all of these are faulty ways to look at reality, but then again what is reality? It's what you make of it. I'd rather everybody be nice and friendly, so I try to be nice and altruistic and it turns out most people *are* good at heart. At least that's what I see in my mirror."

"Yup, someone I know does this. Her kid has been biting other kids at daycare..  wouldn't be a huge deal if it wasn't happening repeatedly. They moved the kid in with the older group and the mom says it's because she's advanced. I know the kid (and love her, this is my family so trying to keep 'em anonymous) and she is NOT advanced. I think they moved her to get her away from the babyish group because of the bite risk. Why we can't have a normal conversation about this, I have no idea. Same womans kid had issues with her feet and ankles developing so she needed little plastic braces to help them develop properly.. she was supposed to wear them every day, just not to bed. The mom instantly started not putting the braces on on the weekends, insisting they weren't needed. People who let their pride get in the way of parenting are some of the worst people imo."

Doing that means they have have your exact password typed into a matrix right next to your email, or some deviation of that.

"Screaming, ""I'm very insecure""."
I am in an endless loop. I am insecure about my intelligence. I feel incredibly uninformed and just... ignorant of so many things. I also tested incredibly high on the CFAT (Canadian military aptitude test). This has caused me to play it up. It's terrible. I know I'm not stupid as time and time again these types of things happen. But I feel incredibly stupid and am very insecure about it.

Saw a fb message in one of his recent messages and he swore he no longer used fb. Saw his cigarette packet in his fucking hand and after stowing it he swore it was his phone (and a week ago he'd sworn he had tossed it and quit smoking). And THEN he started getting really paranoid that I looked at his fb after he gave me the goddamn password or that I looked at his phone after he gave me the goddamn password. Sometimes the lack of trust has a very painful history behind it.  I will never believe someone now without proof. Trust is earned, not given."

Calling yourself a “stable genius”
Ergh I hate when mom's do that.
"Not an expert. Not even close.  I think it has more to do with how each individual processes the world ie: you can only process the world via your experiences, your actions, your thoughts.  Cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am. In some schools of philosophy, that is the only probable truth. Everything outside of you can only be filtered through you.   Your actions lead from your own thoughts/impulses.   And vice versa. Because, for some people, that’s all they CAN know.  So if someone is cheating on a partner, then they are already in the mindset that people can cheat on other people.  Because they cheat. And if they cheat, as the world is viewed only through themselves, other people are probably cheating. If someone is a thief, they know that other people can be thieves. And so on.  I really think it’s as simple as that in some cases. Their experience of the world outside themselves is a variation of “what would I do?”.  Which is not to say that the people who do this are 9th level psyche-karate masters who are all knowingly Cartesian philosophers.  No, it’s just that some people cannot extend their “self” beyond themselves.  How do you counter this?  Well, philosophically, you can do it by realizing that I think therefore I am is just ONE possibility of the “truth” of the world - is it possible that you’re a brain in a jar and everything else in the world is a fabrication of your mind? Sure it’s possible.  Is it probable? Not in my opinion. The world is too vast and complex and people do things I literally consider unthinkable.  So...awesome the world is not a construct of my single mind.   Which means, to me, that there are other minds as complex as mine, or more, or less, out there, in every animal and person on the planet, and possibly beyond.  Ok I can work with that.  NOW, I can filter their behaviour not JUST through my own mind, my own experiences and expectations. NOW I can see each person as being like me, but only in that we are both products of our choices and experiences and thoughts and actions.  It took me awhile. Being curious about the world and about other people helped me a great deal.   The thing that helped me the most was in reflecting on WHY -I- did certain things. Why did I respond in XYZ fashion to ABC thing? Oh turns out I hate drugs because I hate what individual 123 did to me. Is it then reasonable, knowing that my hatred is personal, to ignore evidence that legalization/etc will probably have a net benefit to society? No, it’s not.  I still hate, capital H, drugs. I really, really do.   Edit: I actually just realized this just now - I don’t hate drugs. I hate what abc experience I had from individual 123, who happened to be into that at the time. Hmm. Looks like this self reflection thing works!  But I can see now, WHY I hate them so badly. I don’t hate the drug - it’s just a thing created by people or used by people for a purpose I hate.   I don’t hate the drug users anymore, because once you go down the thought process of why am I like this, you end up educating yourself, you end up trying to see the world not through your OWN mind...but through theirs.  It gives you an appreciation for people I wish I had had all my life, and I am ashamed it took me until it did to learn it.  You begin to appreciate REAL accomplishments in people’s lives.  Like the abused person who breaks the cycle. Or the kid who DOESNT end up in jail. Yeah maybe they aren’t college bound. Maybe they struggled to finish anything let alone high school. Maybe they’re working on a GED, or are trying to save money to get their teeth fixed, or their dream is to have an apartment without mould.  In which case - it makes you wonder, is some huge accomplishment as valid if you could have been MORE? Is it at all impressive if the scion of a ceo ends up as ceo? And so on.  You end up being kinder to people. You end up understanding. You end up being kinder to yourself. You change your behaviour sometimes too, because you can now understand why someone would be pissed off if you’re chronically late - you have their experiences to build from instead of just your own chronic anxiety.  All of this, all of this thinking, take a phenomenal amount of work, and requires a base level confidence in one’s own mind that some people struggle with. You need, and you will develop, over time, a kind of courage to stand up to YOURSELF. You will eventually have the courage and the confidence to stand up to your own knee jerk thoughts.  People are terrified of change. It’s evolution. We are created to be anxious.  And fuck is it tiring. And we are already so, so tired.  Nothing creates anxiety like examining the foundation of your SELF. Hell, we don’t even like looking at the foundation of our homes, because not knowing is better than the possibility that the foundation is rotten.  Hope it made sense."

Even one-upping negative things. “My bad day was worse than your bad day”.
"I used to be incredibly insecure so here are things I used to do:  1. Being overly sensitive. I don't mean being upset when someone badmouths you. I mean getting upset over things you THINK people are saying i.e getting upset at what you infer from people's words.   2. Thinking people hate you or the world is out to get you. It's not. Thinking that way translates to you acting that way. It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, always acting like the victim.   3. Being paranoid. I don't mean the kind where you need to be checked out by the doctor. I'm referring more to thinking your partner is cheating on you or your friends secretly hate you etc... They don't. These are lies invented by your insecurities. Don't fall for them.   4. Excessive bragging. I never did this much but I've seen a lot of people do it. When you brag non-stop about this or that, it doesn't have the effect you want. You never look cool or awesome. It only shows you have a big need for approval and lack self-esteem."

Then they act dejected when you actually leave, forcing to to feel guilty, and then proceed to txt you the whole time you are with your friends to fight about why you wanted to go somewhere without them, making you feel like shit, so you go home and there they are at the door to accuse you of lying about where you were and who you fucked.   No.... this never happened to me/s"

"Screaming ""I'm very insecure"" would be a start"
"People who are very wealthy/fortunate in life and who will insist that they earned everything themselves.  No, you didn't - no one did. You were smart enough to not mess things up so bad that you fell out of your privileged position, but there were a multitude of factors (most outside of your control) and a fair bit of luck that gave you what you have today.  I get that our money worshipping society has equated wealth to moral triumph, so having someone admit that their position in life is mostly circumstance is really hard. Still, it seems like a very insecure response to get ipset about it."
I didn’t expect to be attacked like this

"*constantly* posting about your relationship and how much you love your partner and whatever.   Every single time I did this, it was because the relationship was going downhill and I didn't want anyone to know, so I'd post these super lovey things to make people think we were the perfect couple"
Yea but you’ll have to share those with other people too. You order one when you need it and when it arrives you’ll have to punch in the code you were sent to verify it’s for you. The plus side is you can probably get one to do double duty as a delivery bot and you won’t even have to tip.

That always screamed insecure to me"

She was several years younger than me and felt like she was having to play catch up with me.   She’s leaps and bounds more talented, successful, and creative than me. So if anyone is impressed its me, by her.   But you’re so right - 99% of the time this is a terrible quality in a person."

"&gt; If you send someone a very private email to their regular account it's also possible that someone happens to be in the room when they check their email. If you really want to be certain that no one is seeing the message you should not use something like whatsapp or a regular email.  I think if you are sending someone a private message, it's fair to assume that its going to be read by them, just as if they know other people have acess to your account you'd rather not send any more private messages after it.  Hence why not sharing your password is pretty reasonable thing."

I can see how having a picture taken at a low point in your life make things even worse."

"Not wrong on the low self-esteem count, but I'd rather my friend be an ""attention seeker"" than suffer in silence until I'm at their fucking funeral because they were afraid of the perception of being seen as just another attention seeker.  If you suffer from depression, isolation is common, but social media is a fairly easy way to reach out without ""feeling like a burden"" by specifically asking one person for help.  People need to stop fucking stigmatizing ""attention seekers"". It leads to ER doctors mishandling serious cases because they assume a person just wanted attention... If you have strong evidence that a person is *just* seeking attention and has *no serious issues that should have attention paid to them* then address it as a one-off."

Finished in like 2 minutes, she kept sucking after, and then left. She hasn't responded to me yet. Hahaha'   Like why the hell would you brag about that? You disappointed her that much that she completely ghosted you."
Apparently there is a healthy way to do it which I have yet to discover.

"Even though I wouldn’t, but the petty chaotic side of me would have a hard time not snapping back with “that’s exactly what I’ll be doing!”   Then hope my place isn’t on fire when I come home."
"My mum is just like this. I was apparently walking at 7 months and fully potty trained at 9 months. My first word, and she will swear to this, was pterodactyl. It clearly wasnt. Now I'm a 40 year old who still doesn't understand long division. So congrats to her."
Correct. She assumed it was a woman because the handwriting on the note was feminine.

Honestly, I think any other program would have been a better fit for me (even at that particular University).  At the time, however, I felt really inadequate.  All better now and I still keep in touch with some folks from that program."
"Nah Eleanor isn't really insecure. She's actually got a pretty inflated version of herself at first.  Tahani, though..."
"It took me rejecting 4 therapists before I found the one that worked for me. He was super direct, and would listen to my stories and then dissect them to figure out what insecurities they were rooted in. Then, we'd discuss the root of the issue and explode it out so that we could look at it from all angles. Like I said, it took 10 years, and was not a pleasant ride, but I'd like to think that the end result bore fruit."
"Sometimes I wish my husband and I had one email for banking/subscription accounts. We have each other's passwords and all the autopays draw from our joint account anyway, but since we had long established bills through our personal emails before marriage, it'd be a huge pain to rewrite them all into one, so we deal with the minor inconvenience of logging into each other's accounts if we need to pay or switch something around or whatever."
"So if it has nothing to do with the lifted trucks and everything to do with the driving style, why even mention lifted trucks?   I dont even know what muffler cut down means, but I'm assuming you meant it's straight piped, which is legal almost everywhere.  Legitimate purpose isnt what you decide it is. Whatever reason they did the modifications, are legitimate purposes to them, even if its strictly for the appearance.   As far as no passing zones, they are fairly rare and mostly just include school zones and very busy residential areas with only one lane and I've never seen anyone in a lifted truck pass anyone in those areas. It is not illegal to pass someone on a regular road even on a double solid line.   You tell people to stop making generalizations yet that's all you've done here so far."
"You don't have the patience of a Zen monk? To the pit with you, jackass. You left your mom in the freezing rain because she got kind of snippy? You don't owe that bitch anything, let her walk home. Your car, your rules."

"Purposely putting themselves down all the time, so that others will pity them and shower them with care and concern.

This. Work for AT&amp;T and a customer was telling me how much her bill was and my coworker chimed in saying hers was more.
I'm insecure and tend to go the other way about this.  I point out how others can do way better than me at whatever.
"Not always. I was cheated on in my last relationship and it's pretty much traumatized me to the point that I dream about being cheated on by my current guy and wake up crying from it. Every second of every day is spent thinking about how I'm not good enough and it's a matter of time before it happens again. It's really such a humiliating betrayal of trust that it can fuck with you for a long time. I don't tell anyone about these worries in my real life to avoid sounding like a crazy bitch, but I can't figure out how to stop."

"Man. Premed is killing my confidence in my intelligence. Like. I know I'm smart b/c it's hard af to get into my program. Takes hard work and intelligence. But like everyone else in my program is just as capable if not more capable it seems. Everyone always tries to compare grades and shit, and I'll hear ""oh yeah I got an A+ on that. It was easy shit."" and there I am with my B+ like fuck. I studied hard for that. Then I start wondering if I'm smart enough to be a doctor. All these people talking about the research they're doing and the labs they're working in. Really kills your confidence. The neuroticism is real bruh."

He once started to bullshit about how the police do certain things with crime scenes (I did forensic science in uni, so I'm a trained crime scene officer), he bullshits about certain politics (I'm enjoy keeping up to date about politics and know alot).

One of those lies is that he can speak Japanese and then he proceeds to mumble shit. I'm no expert here but when you watch a lot of anime and then you listen to him, you can tell something is fishy. But I do believe he does that to seem more interesting. There are many other lies like this but he's also a genuinely good person that will go out of his way to help even strangers.

insecure? not necessarily.   an oedipal freak. definitely.
"Wow!  Sounds like you've really, really been through some stuff with your kids.  Thanks for being so loving, I don't know how well I would handle an autistic child.  I know that you do learn patience out of necessity, but I'd be so scared of hurting my child as I made that journey to emotional maturity.  I'm so glad you were there for your child, you're doing such a selfless thing!    The comfort also helps.  It's refreshing to hear that it gets better and that it's hard.  I have lots of stay at home moms around me that like to chastise me, and tell me that I have to love every minute or I'll regret it later because it ""goes so fast"".  I get that gratefulness is important... but being real is much more helpful.    I am so glad you are starting to feel more like your own person!  :) You certainly deserve it."

"Currently working at the VA hospital in the mental health department and I see a couple veterans with narcissistic personality disorder every week. One of the DSM-5 criteria for this personality disorder is a grandiose sense of self importance that typically manifests as an exaggerated sense of achievement and talents without commensurate evidence. Yet these people are extremely insecure. They love talking about compliments that they receive from others (true or not), and give excessive reference to others for self-definition and esteem.   In short what screams insecurity to me is boasting about achievements and how others perceive you as a way to convince others that you are as great and talented as you wish you were"

"Dyslexia has been proven to cause long term self loathing and shame, comparable on a scale to those who experienced sexual abuse from their parents.     Reading some of the replies here, I don't find it particularly surprising."
Nah. It means they just wanna do it themselves.  I agree with those why say the insecurity comes from forcing your help on those who don't need or want it. There's literally no reason to do that except to feel better about yourself.
"Yeah, I don't have FB, but my wife does, and when we got married I was like ""maybe we can have a joint account"", because I thought then people could find be, but I wouldn't be checking the account it really using it unless my wife informed me of something.  She thought it was a terrible idea, and I didn't really understand why until now."

When a girl or guy constantly gets jealous around their s/o over stupid things. I.e  I work at a place where I'm forced to be nice to people (retail amirite?) And often women will accuse me of flirting with their husbands.
"Attempting to belittle customer service workers because you have no real control in your own job and are basically everybody's bitch.    I'm not intimidated by your feeble threats, Karen.  I fucked up your boss's coffee on purpose."
"That's incredibly generalizing. I prefer men because I'm autistic and I get along well with guys to the point that often any other girls in the group get jealous for some reason, like I'm trying to do what you're describing?? What a narrow way of looking at it though ffs. It isn't every time, I do have a few female friends not like that. But way to shit on every socially awkward girl who prefers people with more relaxed standards."
Yea. It’s a super competitive school so most students try to load up on AP and Honors classes just for bragging rights. Most people always compare grades after a test.

Your kid really isn't that interesting, your kid is average and plus there are tons of other subjects to talk about.     Women have been having children all across the globe for millions of years, yours isn't that special,  maybe to you but everyone else is like ""Eh"".  The coolest kids where I work are the ones who's parents actually put some effort into raising a healthy, respectful individual.

"One fix is to just go to everyone you lied to, tell the truth, apologize, and accept whatever fallout there may be.  Terrifying, likely to have some nasty repercussions--but then you are FREE, my friend.  And you will have a strong aversion to lying ever again.

She will pretend to like something she knows nothing about to try and seem relevant. Everyone knows she does it and it's always obvious and it makes people dislike her.  So, if you're the type of person who does this...just know that people are probably onto you and dislike you for it but they probably won't tell you. Just stop and people will like you more."

They don't know how to open the door to their level, and don't particularly care about the education aspect of their job.

She developed relational needs beyond cuddling, and she just couldn't move around... you have to give so much of your attention to a little being with zero mobility.  You're just STUCK there with them.  So, so hard!  Colic is the worst :/ I hope that, if there is a reason for it, you find it.  My daughter had colic and it was because she had reflux, but not enough to make her vomit.  Her stomach acid was sitting in her throat and burning her.  It didn't go away until she could eat solids, but then she was a much happier girl!  It was a really tough journey to get there, though."

"A person being excessively dramatic may be a sign of very serious mental health problems which could very well end in suicide. Sometimes a little compassion goes a long way. You don't have to give up your whole life to a person to afford them basic compassion. There is enough stigma around mental health as it is. Very few people actually want to be bi-polar or have borderline personality disorder, or any number of other issues, but with treatment, many can go from ""annoying attention seekers"" to functional members of society. Generalizing about these people helps absolutely fucking nobody."

You know that you’re better because you do care about things, people, what they’re thinking or what u feel.. but sometimes you would like to throw it away and escape from that and from you. that’s it. you’re scared of the other people, cause you know u can’t control ‘em, you can’t even know what they’re thinking and you may see ‘em laugh of you... you repeat to yourself that you’re stronger.. but you are not.

When I went to college I found my final therapist via internal recommendation and it was covered by the school while I was actively attending. It took me 6 years to graduate, and when I left and got a job, my work insurance covered my last couple years. He figured out the rest of my issues over the last two years."
Here comes the funny part - never gave her any reason to be jealous =D Eventually we broke up coz she was flirting with her male friend.

"There are lots of moms who feel like you do and just don't feel comfortable enough to discuss it due to social stigmas. I mean, I've loved parenting my kid through every stage, I'm definitely not rushing her, but I understand wanting to throw her out of a window sometimes lmao you'd be surprised how many parents you might relate to. Btw I dunno how old your kid is but you can talk about ""real things"" sooner than you might think, depending on your kid. My kid just turned 5 and I let her be a child, but we've also discussed all kinds of things... what death is (dead bugs started that conversation) what stars are while star gazing, empathy, patience, relationships, everything. Not relationships like sex but love. Her dad isn't around so I explain to her that when Nana and grandpa go out, they're going on dates because they love each other.  We talk about day to day stuff... it's really awesome. I'm assuming your kid is 2 or so, it's a tough time, but it's great in it's own right and when it ain't so great remember it will pass. Good luck :)"

"I'm relatively new at my job. While I admit that yes, there are things I still need to improve on and learn to do a little better, there's also someone at said job that CAN'T stop ""giving me advice""     It's not the ""oh, that's wrong, here, this is how we do it"", it's ""this is the way I do it, and I'm going to tell you at the very top of my voice and never let you get a word in edgewise"". Even when I HAVEN'T fucked something up, and had a relatively good day with no huge mistakes, he'll start walking toward me and I'll know it's time to put in the ear plugs. He HAS to make sure I know every day how good he is at his job and how I can learn something from him, even when it's something I'm already doing right"
Do you think that's a better way to live then?  Seems to me the world would be better if everyone got judged on their intents more than now. Like how in law we try to distinguish whether a death was a premeditated murder or murder without premeditation or in self-defense or an accident

"My daughter is 4 so the baby milestones are few and far between these days but I will not tolerate this shit. My sister-in-law (whom I was not very close with) got pregnant 3 months after I did and we both had girls. She kind of stole the name I was going to use (asked what I was naming my daughter and said ""me too!"") so I changed the name.  Even though my daughter was born first, I could have used the name and made her look silly but I really didn't want them to have the same name. I thought they were both deserving of being individuals with their own separate name. I was pissed but I moved on.  After the babies were born, I would catch her trying to compete over the most ridiculous stuff. Her daughter was 2 lbs heavier, she had a vaginal birth and was out of the hospital in 48 hours, etc. You know... stupid shit. I found myself getting annoyed and responding in kind after awhile. Slipping in a conversation about baby weight that I only gained 20 lbs, left the hospital with only 5 lbs to lose, no stretchmarks, etc. You know... *stupid shit*.  At that moment, I saw in her face how self-conscious she was over her new mom body and it felt so shitty that I swore I'd never do that again. I tried to look at it like we were both entering a new stage of our lives and were just excited. That it wasn't a competition, we were just sharing the steps of our journey together.   Her cousin had a girl several months after my niece was born and she was *the* worst. Everything was a competition. The stroller, the kid, the clothes, everything. I made a side comment about how ridiculous it was. That no matter what a mom says about her kid, you will never think that their kid is better than yours. And it just clicked in my sister-in-law's head that while she thinks her daughter is amazing, so do I and so does her cousin. In my mind, my daughter shits on their's and she always will. And those two feel the exact same way. My kid will never be #1 in their lives and *vice versa*. And that's okay. That's exactly how it's supposed to be.   Things have been really nice ever since I made that comment. We grew to be genuine friends and I feel really lucky to experience all of this with her. We depend on each other and ask for advice when things get tough. We talk about our daughters failures and successes, without a hint of competition. I can honestly say that I don't know what I'd ever do without her and I know she feels the same.   I think women just need to be reminded that while they think their kid is amazing, so do the other moms they are ""competing"" with. Sometimes we just need to hear how ridiculous we are being and need to be reminded that they love their kids just as much as we love ours."

Basically, the car will come to a stop with a TINY bit of steam from the exhaust.   On a diesel engine, the high pressure/injection pump will experience a considerable amount of excessive wear, due to the lack of lubrication in water. It'll flash off the water as well."

"When a kid desperately wants a teachers approval to the point where they will snitch on you all the time, try to pretend they have the same interests and race to their class the second their class ends. I have a classmate who does this all the time where with literally any teacher in the school would suck up to them, call us out on anything we did wrong to them or snitch, call us out when we fail at something, trying to form a bond with the teacher even though after secondary school we will probably never see them again and would just lie about our answers, telling the teachers what punishments to give out just in general trying so hard to be the teacher’s pet this guy is like the humanisation of brainy smurf accept he is dumb as a rock.  I’m gonna throw out a couple of examples like the time in PE when everyone someone missed a shot in football (yes we call it football not futebol)  he would tell out “He missed” as if that would make him better than us when he was shit at penalties. Another example is when in art he would tell the art teacher oh thingy needs to start again because he made a mistake and the art teacher being a decent teacher called him out on this and the other things. He goes to excessive lengths to try make himself the best like in maths we had a test and the teacher told him he got the question wrong and said I got a few questions wrong even though I got through the test with almost no wrong answers I also remember in horticulture or like outdoor learning whatever you call it he tried to take and hide my sheet in an attempt to try make me look like I lost it or something.  I’m not sure why he does this because from what I’ve heard and seen his parents don’t seem to neglect him or anything I’m genuinely convinced he just wants to humiliate us.  I’m not going to say his name because I’m not an asshole but if your reading this I know what your trying to do"

Giving backhanded complements. I had a friend who was obviously very insecure. I’m half Arab so I have really nice hair because it’s long and curly. She said something about my hair looking nice but went on to say that long hair doesn’t look as mature. Then she went on to explain that’s why she likes her hair shorter. I was maybe 20 years old so I’m not sure why having long hair would make me look immature. I know plenty of older women with long hair and they look fine.

"My exhusband is 35 and we got divorced because he went from pathological liar about stupid shit to creating fake Facebook accounts to impersonate my friends and harass himself in order to get me to stop talking to my friends (and also harassing me, but mostly himself).  He was already seeing a therapist.  I had no idea whatsoever that it was him until 5 years into the relationship when he left one of his fake ones open on my computer and i recognized the name as one that had recently been telling me to go kill myself and sending him harassing messages.  Holy shit that asshole is completely crazy. It's been damn near exactly 2 years since i found that shit and filed for divorce, but the whole thing really turned me off of other people.

I highly recommend nipping this in the bud as soon as possible and confronting the offending parties. I grew up with an aunt who pitted my cousin and I against each other in every way possible. She literally called us into the bathroom to weigh us together to see who weighed more&amp; lifted our arms&amp; checked our legs to see who was getting armpit&amp; leg hair first. It was so incredibly toxic and damaging that even decades later my cousin and I don't get along. I stupidly never told my Mom until I was older as my Aunt had told me not to&amp; pretended it was a totally normal thing to do. My Mom was appropriately horrified and would have stopped it immediately if she had known.

"The one good thing about big trucks is you can see them coming from a mile away, unfortunately assholes drive all kinds of cars and some you won't see coming until they fly past you weaving through traffic doing 20+ over the limit.  Last week two guys died in my city after their small honda spun out, slid sideways into oncoming traffic and got Tboned by a full size pick up driving in the opposite direction, the driver of the truck survived but both vehicles got destroyed literally. The crash happened on a 4 lane undivided highway, from what the witnessed described the honda was driving extremely aggressively weaving in and out of traffic at a much higher rate of speed than everyone else. I drive that stretch of road everyday and the average speed is ~70, they must have been doing at least 80. Sad for everyone involved, people need to chill"

That sounds so, so amazing!  I can't wait to share my childhood favorites with her when she's grown.  And discover new material that she finds.  It's going to be really fun to be involved in what she loves.  I'm glad to hear that it's possible to have that kind of relationship with your kids.

"They really aren't though. I raise you my two gay friends and two asexual friends, all male. One of the asexuals is by choice and the other is due to sexual abuse in his childhood. They have not managed to find more than a single proper relationship between the two of them because it's such a huge issue for them, even for girls they like.  So are they all ""orbiterz"" too? Or is it that every single woman in your life who has ever paid you any attention was immediately a sexual target for you, and it would be too jarring for you to accept that not everyone is like that?"

I have tried to live a full, adventure filled, exciting life, and in turn have had many unique experiences that i love to share.  However now my life is very different (stay at home dad) I find it difficult to relate to many people now, my life is very insular, with the focus on house, kids, wife, cleaning, cooking.  Upon engaging in conversation memories from a past life come flooding back...I try to bite my tongue.  However it is now in the front of my mind, do I talk too much, do I dominate conversation, do I one up, can i even have a normal conversation any more without analyzing it.  It's not good.   I am super excited about going sailing in Belize in a few weeks, so looking forward to it!  I was out for beers with friends the other night and purposefully didn't bring it up when they were talking vacations, I didn't want to seem like i was one upping even though i am so excited to talk about it.  Its a work in progress."

"Oh for sure. People are insane. My current gf and I have Life 360 with each other, but only because both of our parents had us get it (really for emergencies, her parents are very lax and mine are kinda strict but eh) and so we made our own circle. Honestly, it's great because she knows when I get home safe from her place. Although, her ex was fucking nuts and kept installing shit on her phone that allowed him to track where she was. She isn't dumb and quickly found them, but oh lord the amount of shit I could say about the total piece of garbage her ex was... oof."
"Except that's the exact same thing and just as bad. My ex used to state, in her defense, that she just didn't trust other women, not that she didn't trust me. In either scenario, my actions are suspect and I can't go anywhere on my own.  Also, she banged her boss, so I guess women really can't be trusted?  No, that's a stupid generalization.

"My ex-husband and his second wife have I joined Facebook profile. I recently moved back to the same city where they are located. she is also now forbidden me to ride in a car with him to see an activity for our sons because me and him aren't allowed to be in the same car anymore by her decree. Meanwhile, because how he acted during the divorce I would never touch him with a ten-foot pole so there's no danger of us having an affair.  If I have to miss my sons' tournament that is a 9 hour drive away (I have rheumatoid arthritis so can't reasonably do an 18-hour drive in a weekend) because they have an unhappy marriage filled with jealousy they're both going to have a real problem with me.   I should note that weight easily shared cars for the kids activities for six years when I live in another state and he would fly in to see them. I guess he lied to her all those times and never told her that I was with them even though I know she knew in the beginning because I actually FaceTime to her while we're driving to one of the tournament in the past. I guess a few years ago, she put her foot down and said that was allowed anymore. I wish my ex-husband had the backbone to stand up to her for the sake of our kids because I think we should both be at their activities because it's what's best for them, but his wife's insecurities are causing a whole heap of problems."

"Tell him that isn't how phds work. More is not better, despite what marvel movies will tell you. Getting more than one PhD in totally unrelated fields means you couldn't decide what you wanted to do with your life, not that you are extra smart. Getting two phds on closely related fields is useless, and often not possible (a lot of schools won't let people who already have a related phd apply to their program). A PhD is a general degree that teaches you how to do research, as well as a more specific degree that makes you sort of an expert in a narrow area. The point of getting a PhD is to show that you can learn on your own and solve problems even when they aren't in your specific sub field. It isn't like a masters where you are getting specific instruction in one area of study. Someone with a PhD in one area can work in an only partly related area because they have learned how to teach themselves new things. Therefore, getting more than one PhD completely missed the point and also is a waste of years of your life."

"Hey I know this person! My version is a guy who had probably average intelligence, but was obsessed with people thinking he was smart. A friend of mine once broke up with him saying it was her, etc. He kept pushing and she got annoyed and basically said it was because he wasn't smart. She regretted being blunt, but he could never get over it.  So to show her how smart he was, he said he'd get his PhD. When he finally graduated he actually found her email and sent her proof of his PhD and said he graduated with honors. He was clearly pleased with himself, like he'd won some years-long fight with her. She humbly complimented him on his intelligence hoping to get him to feel like he'd 'won.' Privately she felt bad for her comment and pitied him for caring almost a decade later. It'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.  I believe he was raised in a neglectful home, which often leads to insecurity."

Somewhere in the middle of my 10 years of active therapy I had somehow made a bunch of friends in college. After a couple years, I noticed something was off with them, everyone was acting strange. I will never forget the night that I had to get one of my nicer friends drunk to figure out what was going on. After many beers, I started pressing him for information, and he eventually turned to me and said something I'll never forget:  ""You know how there's that one person in every friend group that everyone just puts up with but doesn't like? The one that everyone tries to avoid and not invite places and stuff? You're that person.""   That was one of the biggest turning points of my life.

"That's what it is.  They kind of are like pets.  That's part of what makes it so hard.

It is particularly fine if you realize this is a journey that requires responsibility and effort and a decent partner.          But the persistence and emphasis when you announce ""proudly"" that you don't want kid, as if it was particularly brave or modern (while really, no one cares if you don't make babies) screams that you actually do want kids but you haven't been able to get your shit in order or to find a decent partner  - which are actually good reasons to wait or not do it-, and you're turning this insecurity on its head by boasting you don't want any."

"God, I work with a woman like this. She constantly complains about everything to the point where another co-worker and I have both agreed that it's extremely draining to even have a conversation with the complainer.   The complainer recently told me that a friend of hers sent her a long text explaining to her that she didn't want to be friends anymore because the complainer was way too negative about everything. The complainer couldn't understand why her friend would say something like that. I took all of my effort to hold back my laughter when she told me that."

"This one is conflicting for me. Women are insane and pretty territorial. I have *mostly* male friends. Partly because each workplace I’ve been in was male dominated and partly because of this territorial thing women do.   There are two types of women: builders and breakers. I’m a build up other women type of person. My girl-friends are mostly the same way. I have a few that aren’t and just are *so negative* about other women that it’s getting harder and harder to be around them as I get older. I’m not looking at another woman with hate in my heart trying to reassert the fact that I’m “better”. I’m looking at her finding all the great things I see: pretty teeth, outfit cute af, boots on point, magnetic personality. It feels like my friend will see these things and then feel the need to comment her eyebrows don’t match or something petty and stupid.   So by default when meeting new people, I’d gravitate towards the dudes because they don’t tear women down like that. They also have better topics for the most part? Like I wanna talk about video games and typical boy crap and escape from the negativity in life. I don’t want to stand in the kitchen drinking wine talking about how Jamie’s husband is cheating with the neighbor.   I’m not saying all women are like this, I know there are women who don’t care about the chisme. I make quick friends with those women.   I’m also kinda into women so idk if that makes a difference."
"I feel you. I have Complex PTSD, been cheated on, and always hear about these relationships where ten years down the line someone finds out the other had been fucking around. Even with no indication that I should be worried, a part of my mind is dedicated to laying out all the ways and reasons it could be happening.  I don't guess I have any advice. Just sympathy. It's so hard."

I don't care about their opinions.  My friends tell me I acted incredibly shitty to them (because of &lt;insert excuse&gt;), I apologize profusely.  Because I care about their opinions.  I cannot and will not try to appease everyone.  I look for people who are open minded and happy to live their lives to the fullest versus stringent and stagnating people who only want to live in their echo-chambers."

I wasn’t the only one she bullied.   I had some emotional issues one day and she blew them out of proportion to get me fired, it ended up backfiring on her."

My “homework” folder
"So this summer and old friend and I reconnected. We were hanging out a lot and occasionally I thought I saw signs of her liking me. Fast forward past it flopping and her ghosting me for a month before admitting some shit. I had already deleted her # and removed her off snapchat / FB   Well, she came up in my suggested friends on FB so I glanced at her profile. She posted on FB recently *""If they want to see you, they will. If they want to talk to you, they will""*  Now, the bitterness in me says she's talking about me but in reality that could be about anyone. But disregarding that, that post makes it seem as if she isn't responsible at all for upholding a part of a friendship / relationship. They're two way streets and she could just as easily reach out to talk to whomever she was referring to in that post.   I was just kind of dumbfounded and was like ""welp, might be a good thing it didn't work out between us""."
"Insecure, has no boundaries, has issues they need to resolve within their own self they need to get figured out. I’m glad you’re out of that relationship, it’s exhausting to feel that every move you make is watched that closely"

"This is only going to get worse. Somehow for your daughter, you and your wife need to figure out how to handle this. This best approach is a direct approach. Call her out everytime and continue to do so until she stops. You don't want this affecting your daughter as she gets older. Your sister-in-law sounds like she has always been jealous of your wife. Did your sis-in-law get pregnant because your wife was pregnant? Dealing with people like that as an adult is one thing, however, when people do this with their kids vs. yours is not okay. It is not okay for the children. Theirs or yours.  Eta:comma"

Apparently it's too be in a constant state of anger and to write passive aggressive emails and to talk down to anyone that is not in a position over you.  Whether it's your own team, other people in the company, vendors, etc.  Apparently they think being a giant dick will hide the fact that they don't know what the fuck they're doing."

"It's surprisingly accurate as well. I live in a small town about 45 minutes from a medium Midwestern city. The amount of young men driving around in lifted, diesel pickups is almost appalling. I know several guys that have 3/4/1 ton trucks as their daily driver. They work in places where a truck with that capability is completely unnecessary.   Do I think they should be able to do that? Yes, do whatever the fuck you want, I don't care. If you got that kinda money, flaunt it my bro.   Do I think it's an intelligent decision to spend 70K on an automobile? No, I do not. I've been asked why I drive a little shit box car when I could ""easily afford"" a truck like theirs. Well, fact of the matter is, I like getting 35 MPG, it's paid for, and your truck payment is equal to my mortgage. I'm not looking for more payments.   Just different priorities I guess."

Just basing this off of many of the relationships I see around me where one or both the partners are increasingly jealous of the other partner’s friends (even same-sex best friends they’ve had for years) and their interactions on social media. I’m not talking about possessiveness but just extreme jealousy and fear of being cheated on (which can eventually evolve into possessiveness but not necessarily).
"Regardless, it still takes insecurity to be the way I was talking about.  Someone can scream ""I'm very insecure"" without being annoying AF.  But yeah, the kind of people you are talking about are very annoying for sure."

Might sound dumb, but I’ve started actively talking to myself in my head. “That isn’t a nice thing for us to say, what can we do instead?” I switched to using we instead of I because it makes me feel less guilty for having mean thoughts. When I get better at it, I plan to switch back to using I. Using we also helps me with negative thoughts toward myself. I find it translates into how I talk to others"

Yes that was the joke
Constantly making self deprecating jokes.   It’s okay to admit your flaws and joke about them from time to time but there comes a point where you’re  clearly trying to convey something and it’ll prolly make the people around you very uncomfortable when they begin to notice it.
"Holy shit I was going to post the same thing.   We have a million people like that here in Texas.

"Treating people who have the audacity to come up with new ideas like they're terminally stupid. There's a strange attack-mode that the most insecure enter into when someone else in the room proves inventive — mock them for upsetting the status quo, reframe novelty as idiocy, convert the threat into comic relief."
"It's not ironic. People see in others what they are. Racists see racists, thieves see thieves, hypercriticals see hypercriticals. They don't understand that not everyone is like them, often because they've only ever been exposed to similar thoughts and cultures."

Tried to gently lead him to that conclusion himself and guide him to do things that felt good for me until one night after too many drinks I just said it outright"

"I did this for an uncomfortable number of years. Any time someone talked about media or music or made any reference to something I could tell was cool, I would just laugh or nod or say oh yeah I definitely have seen that. And I totally hadn't.   And my go-to phrase was ""yes I've seen it but it was so long ago"" or ""I fell asleep during that I think"" so I still hold some cool rank in their mind.   Tbh its taken a lot of self control to get myself out of that habit. Being okay with not knowing what someone is talking about definitely makes you seem more secure and people generally do not look down on you. I wish someone had told me that sooner."
"Dude same. Always been one of the dudes and I have no issue with women, we just don’t always share interests so we don’t have a whole hell of a lot to talk about.

Eventually met one but for the most part being one of the boys gave me some of the coolest friends ever and some of the weirdest dating stories."
"Not OP but once was out with my ex and ran into an old classmate, I don't know if it was because I was giving this other girl more attention or what but my ex started randomly talking about how good I was at something (Been 4 years I can't recall exactly), we both just kind of looked at her and went back to the conversation.   It was the moment I knew something wasn't right in her head because we had been discussing my classmates new tattoo of two teddy bears and she was telling us about why she got it, her brother had recently committed suicide.. Just not the time  I would have struck it up to feeling awkward but we had all been in a science course together and I sat beside the other girl with my ex a row in front so they weren't exactly strangers or anything."

"For the people commenting on your post, not so much for you.  Folks forget that flashing your lights and other such things used to be ways to communicate when driving. Normal comminution, not road rage. It's unfortunate that so many people perceive it only as the person that is flashing as being a dick. Granted, if you drive a jacked up pickup and stick your lights in someone's window as you flash your lights you're just being a dick.  To this day I still flash to let people know I'm waiting for them to move over. Inviting them to be polite. And when I flash asking you to move out of the way it's not me being a jerk initially.  Let me illustrate. My sister years ago had a habit of going slow when passing semi trucks. While doing so she lost control of her car got the truck and had a terrible wreck. Luckily she was fine. Then in an odd coincidence a couple months later a person we new had a similar wreck and got pretty banged up.  Let's add to that. I've had friends and family that drive truck. Many of them make it clear how nerve wracking it is when people slowly pass next to them and end up cruising in their blind spots. It causes anxiety for some drivers. Others really could care less if you wreck.   All that said, now I get extremely antsy when folks slowly pass others. And not just big semis. I'm of the opinion that if you're passing, please please, just pass. I feel trapped in a bad spot. I realize it's my own experiences that create that anxiety but please, just pass so we don't have vehicles stacked side by side going 60-85mph."

They are usually very good in their field, and often very intelligent in general, but those letters don’t automatically make them geniuses.  I’m sure this doesn’t make you feel any better.

"Lol, I bought my landlord a $400 tv, since I think I accidently broke his old, pre-used model, which was already the fourth one in 2 years.  He was gracious, counted it as a month's rent, and I didn't bat an eye cause we finally had a fresh tv, no ""previous owner"" bullshit, and it's a big one, too.  The next day, my roommates who live off rental furniture show up with a *slightly* bigger tv, that they now have to cram into their tiny room, constantly talking about how nice their tv is.  I think it bugged em that I didn't care, since I bought the tv I did cause A. We needed a working tv.  B.  I messed with the settings that f-ed the screen, and C.  Because my landlord is a movie buff, and the big screen was a consideration i made for HIM.  He didn't ask, I was just fixing problems, so the vanity purchase gained them absolutely zero interest."

Omg I realize this sounds like r/notlikeothergirls....I promise it’s not I’m just being honest.

"So my friend's wife would say and text him stuff like this. I too thought she was really insecure, and she probably is.    Then I found out that he did cheat on his wife with a girl at work (wife doesn't know). I've known him for 8 years and he was never the type to cheat in any sense of the word.    I think her saying this type of stuff (and generally not loving each other) lead him to cheat. It's still very wrong. He was a great guy, still is, but just the fact that he did something like that is a stain on his moral character.    I don't hang out with him much anymore. Not the same person that was my best friend. And his wife sucks."

"Don't apologize - I think it's interesting! Yeah, it's really hard to understand what it's like unless you've gone through that ringer and come out the other side intact. While you're in the middle of it all, you literally forget that you made all this shit up and your ""real life"" mutates and changes -- but not to you. To you, you experienced everything you made up, you've associated emotions with it, have dreamt about it, etc. It's just as real as anything else in your life.  The only thing I know how to equate it to is the effects of the drug Salvia Divinorum. When you ""break through"" on Salvia, the first thing you forget is that you took a drug. Then, you forget what drugs are. Then, you forget what time is. What the world is. What reality is. And your subconscious creates you a new reality, a new world, a new existence -- one that you accept and live in forever because it's all you know.   That's also why I don't fuck with drugs like that anymore. I tried it once (after I got better, luckily). Never again. It was way too 'real' to me, and reminded me of the worst parts of myself.  With all that in mind, you begin to understand how destructive that kind of mental illness can be, especially if the individual in question has enormous emounts of power and reach."

"Bragging about your sexual experiences. Odds are if you’re bragging about having a threesome or turning a lesbian straight with a good deep dicking, odds are it didn’t happen and you’re just insecure.   I also had an acquaintance whom, since high school, and to this day, would talk about all of the “10/10 women” that wanted to have sex with and did have sex with him. Here’s one example.   His parents own a Mr. Sub in town and this one time, a straight knockout came in and wanted a sub but forgot her wallet. So obviously she blew him in the bathroom for it.   What a pathetic human being he is to make up that shit. Never mind this being a stranger, but he went on to spread the same type of stories about people we went to high school with and actually knew.   He’s a giant insecure piece of trash."

"But the “toxic femininity” thing you mentioned has a flip side. We aren’t really given a pass, and these stereotypes often work against us when we want to be taken seriously for legitimate concerns. No one is giving this woman a pass or applauding her. She’s the “crazy bitch” you see in every comedy movie. The issue here is that her behavior isn’t recognized for what it is, abuse.   Toxic masculinity comes into play in this case because:   1) men are considered to be inherently stronger, meaning women who abuse them are not considered a threat, even in situations where the power imbalance is in the women’s favor.   2) men are pressured to suppress and not show emotion, so their emotional abuse is not taken as seriously because society tends to shame men for speaking out about it.   3) the whole “men are just looking to spread their seed, while women are looking for commitment and need to watch their men” stereotype is everywhere from movies to books to women’s magazines. This negatively affects men who are sexually harassed, only to have their concerns brushed off because men are supposed to want sex from every attractive woman they meet, even in situations where it’s harassment/abusive. This also makes it harder to recognize the woman’s behavior in this case as emotional abuse."

Like how he knew a guy who was paralysed and he couldn't satisfy his wife sexually so he would let him go round and eff the hell out of her so he could hear, or going on a date with a woman and when they got down to it she proceeded to pull out a large sheet of plastic tarpaulin because she was an insane squirter!! Just so many stories, even a supposed celebrity which made me raise an eyebrow. It was a massive turn off hearing this shit every day in the end I felt dirty after being intimate with him.

"My niece is six months younger than my daughter but also super precocious and hit all of her milestones early. It's hard not to question yourself as a parent when your kid is barely managing single words and her younger cousin is already speaking in sentences. I never lied about her progress or got upset at my niece or her parents for her doing better, but there were definitely moments where I wondered if I was failing my kid in some way. It doesn't help that there's a ton of messaging out there indicating that you're a horrible parent and permanently scarring your child if you do/don't do/sometimes do x y or z.  There's a lot of pressure on parents. We want the best for our kids but they don't come with manuals, and there's no way to know at any point if you're doing the best or right thing. If your kid isn't hitting milestones as fast as her peers it's hard not to wonder if you're somehow at fault. Yes, even for teeth."

The JDM crowd is extremely annoying in a Fast and the Furious teenage kind of way, and the truck people... well they tend to be loud and aggressive douchebags who use the size of their vehicles to intimidate and bully other drivers."
"I tend to agree with this. I'm nearly 100% certain it's a result of bad parenting.    One of the defining moments of my life, was the day I showed my dad how it also works choosing  other options, instead of always being the best.    We were at little athletics (around 13 years old or something), and one of the guys in my group had never won a race, because he wasn't the most coordinated kid out there. Not once. So I spoke to the boys, and we organised something for the 100m. We all pretended that we were really exhausted, and he won. He knew we were all letting on a bit, but it was the first time he ever won a race. He really broke down.  My dad said he was really proud of me after he found out that I organised it, and that he learned something that day."

Haha this is the way my brother and his wife are with my nephew...it's friggin weird. I used to think they had it all together and were the perfect couple then realized after many years that they're both delusional and it pops up in odd ways. Like the curtain being moved the tiniest bit and you see them for the insecure couple they are at heart.  When my nephew was literally 6 months old my brother was convinced his kid was already reading and had way stronger grip than other babies. I was nice about it but I was also kind of like ummm dude I don't even think it's friggin possible to know either of those things. Your son is a blob. That's about it for now.  Now my nephew is 6 and my brother and his wife constantly put up the most sneaky arrogant Facebook posts about how it's such an inconvenience because he's just SOOOO smart. Like too smart and its just so tough for them to keep up with. They mask it as a funny well written thing but I know what they're really doing there and it makes me chuckle but also annoys me because it's like okay...well not every parent is that fortunate so maybe be aware that other parents with a lot worse going on in their children's health or life would switch in a heart beat. I'm sure some people think I'm just being a prick but if you saw the posts and knew them for years you'd get it.

An insecure person
"I'd say me Like when I look down on people and berate their beliefs or undermine their ideas. I constantly find myself thinking that people around me are just ignorant and cannot get a clue. I latch on to anything that would disprove other people's beliefs or opinions. I really feel shitty about this especially when I find myself doing it to people that actually give a shit about me. It always comes down to my insecurity, ""everyone undermines and overlooks me constantly, so why should I bother sparing their feelings?"" Sometimes I go through a period of self reflection (like right now), but that thought always brings me right back where I started. The shittiest part is that I am aware of the problem and how to solve it, but I just can't no matter how hard I try to accept myself and appreciate what I am and what I have. I recently hurt someone close to me recently because of this bullshit and I honestly don't know what to do. More than that, I'm scared it's not the last time."

"I live in the South. I've not met a well adjusted man yet that has a Truck jacked up to the point you need a ladder to climb in. Usually with a coat of mud and offensive stickers, which is just a way to express his political/philosophical opinions. When any of it is challenged they become threatened and insecure, usually resulting in them peeling off in said truck."

Not properly loving your biddles
"There was this guy in my middle school that made fun of me for my moderate-republican views while still being bisexual, and the fact that my dad’s mom came from mexico. Anyway, it’s been 1 year since he moved and I’m in grade 9. I looked at his social media last week and it turns out he’s gay and republican (and dated 2 latino guys) So if you bully people for what they are or what they stand for, you’re probably insecure about being like that."

"One time a couple years ago me and 2 other guy friends were talking about sex. About how we like this position, that position, oh yeah. Last year I confessed to one of the friends that I was a virgin at that time and quite inauthentic. He confessed the same. The third friend was certainly getting laid though.   But yeah, 3 guy friends all talking about our favorite sex positions when 2 of us were virgins..."
Body building
"Ugh, this is me. I'm cross eyed and have a funny nose and have tons of horrible pics of myself. When selfies came along I learned how to pose so my eyes didn't cross and the angle didn't make my nose look as obvious. And I use filters to smooth my skin. Yeah, I'm definitely insecure about my looks but it helps feeling like I have some decent pics to look on when I'm feeling especially bad."
"Often?  Then maybe you need to check if youre going too far in some way.  If it was one or two I'd say its them, but ""often"" tells me you might be unaware you're crossing a line somewhere.  Ask a female coworker (not a friend) to observe and evaluate."
Yeah? Well I died after six months of torture in an unlisted POW camp where I contracted 37 diseases and fought my way out with my bare hands before dragging myself 50 miles back to my base and reporting the locations of various enemy bases from a map I memorized after seeing it for 3 seconds and finally succumbing to by battle wounds.

"Holy fuck I actually got emotionally traumatized dating a girl exactly like this. I remember one night waking up to her hitting me because she went through my phone while I was asleep and found I snap chatted my cousin who was a girl.   It's pretty rough to be woken up like that then have to deal with the aftermath of  calming her down and explain I'm not cheating on her. This was just one of many, many instances.

"My now ex bf was the one that cheated on me, (I stupidly took him back) but he would be the one to go through my phone and check every little notification. My car insurance sent me a text monthly to notify me of an upcoming payment and he felt the need to open and read the text, everytime. One day I decided to do it to him and found a dating app on his phone. Dumped him immediately. I never gave a shit if he went through my phone, I had nothing to hide, but it turns out he did."

“White Supremacy.”
"I went to high school with a compulsive liar. It was equal parts sad and maddening, and I always figured the root cause was insecurity. He was a football player from Kentucky recruited to play at an elite boarding school, and I think he felt like the “real” him was so much less interesting than his classmates that he started making up a backstory, and that somehow became his reality.   We ended up in the same city later in life and reconnected. By then he’d gone on to play at UNC, graduated, gotten married, and totally snapped out of being a liar. The irony of the whole situation was that, once I got to know who he really was, his real backstory, had he just told the truth, was a lot more interesting and impressive than most of the people in our school. He had worked his ass off and earned his spot, and in the mixed up mind of a teenager in a socially competitive environment, somehow got the idea that you weren’t cool unless you were a legacy who’d just been handed everything on a silver platter.   Teenagers are stupid."

Yes, when I had back surgery and couldn't even climb the stairs in my house for two months, I *could* have just basically stopped eating and maybe I would have lost weight, but it wouldn't have been healthy, and it wouldn't have been sustainable.   The main thing is: you don't know what someone is going through or dealing with. So why be an ass to someone about it? Go get your own damn house in order and stop throwing stones.

"I don't think it's that binary. There was a study that showed that (at least in men) people who had high levels of testosterone, they were more likely to be jealous. If it's completely psychological I can understand what you're saying but a lot of it CAN be due to hormones. This isn't an excuse to say ""It's just hormones bro, go cheat on your loved ones"" but it's not just a projection.  &amp;#x200B;  However I do agree in that jealousy as a projection DOES exist and it manifests in the form where once people have already cheated, they will use jealousy as an armor to protect themselves. Also the mentality of ""If I did it, everyone else would too."" People being jealous is not a dead-giveaway. Expert psychologists would err the side of caution when making statements like that. People are naturally jealous. All the time. It doesn't mean anything. Jealousy is a normal feeling to have. It's how you process the feeling and behave after. Knowing a bit of psych, you wouldn't think JEALOUSY is the dead giveaway. It's the compulsive need that's the red flag. Most of us when feeling jealous can put our jealousy aside and function normally. We might drag our feet about it but ultimately we don't have a compulsive need to project jealousy onto other people.  &amp;#x200B;  Obsessive/compulsive people who use jealousy as a manipulative tool however are the ones you're thinking of."

It becomes clear that they're not being honest and for some reason feel their point isn't valid enough to elaborate on, which comes from their low self esteem.

"I had a friend like this, I’ll call her Jane. Her dad raised her to think she was better than everyone else. We did a project together once for school and she was on the phone with him after when we were driving home and he said “I bet you did so much better than that laerie girl” and I was just so confused as to why he would say that because it was something we did together.   I finally understood when my husband and I got married. Her and her bf (Jack) were in our wedding party. My husband and I really suck at dancing and were really nervous about our first dance as a couple. My husband’s best man, his cousin, and my MOH went out to a bar the previous night and were playing some slow dance tunes on the juke box to get some pointers (his best man and his cousin are excellent dancers). We learned a lot in a few hours, so when Jack and Jane came over the next night before we went to dinner with the whole wedding party, we showed them some moves, feeling pretty proud of our improvement.   Later that night, Jack let it slip that Jane had texted him earlier saying “omg lol laerie and [husband] suck at dancing”. Jane immediately burst into tears and apologized to me. But I knew that mean spirited judgmental crap was who she really was. We weren’t friends with them much longer after that. It made her feel better about herself I guess."

Say on a math test or whatever, if the question was a simple equation of 1+4-1 I'd easily do it mentally but then double check it with a calculator. 4. The class clown, if they do talk.

"When you build a culture around the idea that men are inherently stronger than women, either physically or emotionally, it gives them an unjustified position of power. But it cuts both ways. When you have a position of power, it automatically minimizes trauma or abuse. People see what in any other circumstance would be abuse and dismiss it because they see the abused as naturally having the upper hand. The fact is though that anyone can be traumatized or abused, just look at Terry Crews for an example.  Obviously my personal experiences have shaped my views though. In my abusive relationship, everyone thought my GF was incredibly shitty. She didn't get a pass to be a POS because she was a woman. However no one called it abuse. It took me years to see that it was in fact abusive, all because I thought on some deep level that I couldn't be abused, that only women could be.  That's not to say toxic feminism doesn't exist (or that there aren't women who get away with things purely for the reasons you list), but I see that as a much smaller issue than toxic masculinity. A lot of guys see these inequalities - the stigma against emotional expression or mental illness - and they react by blaming feminism, and end up perpetrating the very same culture that harms us all.   My go to example of this behaviour is the video of [""Big Red""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_ZryBfCtU). She presents herself aggressively, but people who saw the video just saw an angry, ""triggered"" feminist. If they actually listened to what she's saying, they would see that she is in fact rejecting the repressive male stereotypes, and that she too is trying to address the issues they all are fighting against."

"Honestly, he wasn't a bad dude aside from his bullshitting. We were only 19 or 20 around that time; if I met someone like this now whom I genuinely considered a friend, then I would just tell them straight up that they didn't have to make up stories to feel included or impress me. But back then, my brother and I just agreed to let him tell his stories and see how far we could get him to take them."

"Laughing as a coping mechanism.  At the gym, the girl next to me was working with a trainer for the first time -- every time her trainer had her do a new exercise, it was a flood of giggles that may have been masking crying as she got over the learning curve of the first few.  Yes, overhead presses, goblin squats and ball slams are awkward the first time you do them -- for everyone. We were all new once, shut up and learn."
Cheating on someone to try to prove your worth or that you are desirable.
Gossip
"There was a guy I worked with who was ""always getting laid"" .  But the worst story was, ""I picked up a girl at the gas station and we had sex while driving. Do you know how hard that is with a stick shift car?"" I guess she was so thankful she climbed on top of him while driving 3 blocks to her house.   After this story he was kind of the joke at the break room."
"**It's about the journey not the destination, man**  No but really, I struggle with this sometimes. For example, my drive to work is roughly 5 minutes. I have to turn right shortly after getting on the main road so I generally stay in the right lane. But sometimes on my way to work I'll end up behind someone who is going like 5-10 mph BELOW the speed limit with either no cars in front of them or like a 5-car equivalent gap in between them &amp; the next car   Meanwhile, cars are passing us easily in the left lane. I so badly want to just jet out from behind him and overtake him but I also know in reality it will only shorten my trip by &lt;1 minute if that. So I try not to do it to avoid being ""that guy"". **But for fucks sake at least do the speed limit.** That's where I get so conflicted.   Or, you got grandma over here going 10mph below the speed limit and braking WHILE SHE ALSO HAS LIKE A 5 CAR GAP IN FRONT OF HER. like, why the fuck are you braking? And again I hate to be ""that guy"" so I don't overtake them but end up fuming because I'm stuck behind a dumbass.  Edit: to clarify, I drive a '98 subaru legacy wagon. So not a truck lol"

Literally ""thanks for the American secrets, comrade, please accept these cigars, meet me at the watchtower at midnight!"" He's furious.   Literally days later we are visiting our extended family and he starts making fun of the appearance of our brink-of-death step grandma. Sure, we found her to be a bit obnoxious and loud growing up but she NEVER mistreated us. There she is, skin and bones, barely there mentally, a hard fall blinded her eye, and she can barely stand let alone walk.  But there's my brother making fun of her to me when literally days before he couldn't handle an incredibly benign spy joke. That's how my brother is though, he's never been able to joke about himself or anything related to himself but he will dish it out.   My brother is insecure."

I'm quite insecure about my body. I wasn't always the fittest and most lively person in my house and school. And I'm on a journey to change my life. There were a lot of things I wanted to do before, but because I was very insecure, I didn't do them. So, next year, when I'm in high school, I will try do those activities :)"

"When you scream ""I'm very insecure!"""
"One of my best friends continually bragged about how her son was talking in sentences when he turned two. And yeah, he was I suppose if you count "" I want a drink"" or "" I don't like this biscuit"". She got me worried that my girl was only saying one or two words strung together when she turned two. At 3 you can't shut her the fuck up. It's backfired. Her second child is almost two and a half and hardly speaks. Mostly single words. Her son at 4 still speaks like when he was two, and is hard to understand unless you know him well. My daughter is a year younger and everyone understands her 90% of the time. I would never say that to her because her kids seem completely average. Just like mine.   I don't make a big deal of it. The older she gets and the more kids I get to know the more I realise she was always totally average. Some are speaking fully at 2, others nearer 3, some at 4 are only just getting the hang of longer phrases. Most of them work it out at some point. It doesn't matter who does it first or best. For the most part all of them get it eventually. Plus the kid who isn't talking may have better fine motor skills, or better balance, be a good sleeper, great eater, pick up potty training in a week etc."
That doesn't stop.  I'm 30 now and I hear it all the time at work.

"Constantly telling your children about how their other parent is going to hell for drinking and accusing them of having wanted to cheat during the marriage (when they've ended three marriages including that one due to cheating) and how everyone anywhere is ignoring the parts of the Bible they don't want to live by while blatantly breaking the big ten daily. Also waiting in the kitchen smoking cigarettes all night and accusing children going to the bathroom of trying to do something to her or steal from her or ""support atheism"" by watching Conan O'Brien (a fucking Catholic) on late night television.  Nothing turns a kid atheist faster than a psychopathic Christian mother."

She said this like 8 times because people were being really courteous that everyone who wanted a turn got one.  The kicker is that she did end up doing a song and wasn't even a good singer. She wasn't terrible but most of the other people there were better."

"Yep. I’ve struggled with internalized misogyny most of my life (not so much now but I do need to check myself every once in a while). For me, it was because of both my mommy and daddy issues. Hated my mom and wanted my dad’s approval. My dad was always quite misogynistic himself and would put women down all the time (women can’t drive for shit, that news reporter’s too ugly to be on TV, blah blah blah, as well as being abusive to my mom) so I imitated him since I was little.. I guess I thought we bonded over it. I’m also bisexual and would treat women I dated with/hooked up with like shit. Once I was older and more self aware, I was able to figure it out and change. I will say that the majority of my friends are still men.. I connect with very few women well.. but I think this is because I’m autistic and men are more straightforward whereas women tend to use more subtle social cues and stuff which gets extremely confusing and anxiety inducing for me."

"I saw exactly this working daycare. He wasn't 12 months yet but I'm not sure exactly how old he was. Anyway, the room had two identical toy boxes across the room from each other and 'Max' had been holding onto one, cruising and eyeing the other toy box. He rocked back on his feet and just went! Never had taken a single step and took 10. He got to the other one and slapped his hands on it then got a look I've always remembered. Like oh.my.God did you see that shit?! His eyes got huge and he looked around for me with a huge grin. Of course I picked him up and swung him around. It was the cutest thing ever."
I called a friend out on this years ago on her post. All of her friends proceeded to shit on me non stop. Fucking dumb.

"It is a blanket statement. Being jealous is not a dead giveaway for cheating. Compulsive need to project jealousy onto other people based on YOUR OWN MISTAKES YOU COMMITTED is the dead-giveaway for a toxic relationship though. People are jealous all the time. Most of us can put aside our envy or jealousy; admittedly we wouldn't handle it in the most dignified way for some of us but there is no compulsive need to express or vocalize an unfounded accusation based on nothing more than the idea of ""If I would cheat, so would you.""  &amp;#x200B;  I especially love the touch of flair of ""anyone who knows a bit of psych knows"" when in reality, anyone with actual psychology background (w/ actual credentials and not just armchair psychologist) will tell you there's no such thing as an absolute ""textbook"" symptom-cause relationship. Meaning there's no such thing as a ""jealousy = cheating for sure."" The ""textbook symptoms"" that DO exist aren't exactly textbook; they're COMMON symptoms associated with X or Y. Any person here should be able to name me textbook symptoms of panic attack. This doesn't mean just because I see ONE of those textbook symptoms pop up will always make it a panic attack."

"Following along the comments here and as grown adults with jobs, children, mortgage, etc., the only option for a couple with a healthy relationship (meaning excluding all the weird cheating stuff discussed above) is joint accounts.  Reddit is skewed toward a relatively narrow demographic and you're not going to see the more common ""we share accounts"" responses here.  I'm just replying to you to let you know what you've just described is normal.  We did go one step further and created a domain (it's easy and pretty cheap at google) and made a shared account.  We are in the process of slowly transferring everything over to it - social media, entertainment accounts, vet, medical, day care, child care, invitations, announcements, neighborhood stuff, food delivery, etc.  We still have our personal accounts out there but use them less and less.  It's a suuuuuper life saver to be able to have one place to deal with and manage our life.  Most people (obvs not everyone, just the large middle/majority) who don't do this are not living in a healthy, long-term relationship."

"My ex was like that, but I didn’t even know because it was 90% behind my back, and very passive aggressive. I once had a conversation about college stuff with a female friend we ran into at the supermarket, and my ex got angry at me for it"

Defintely people who quickly use or threaten with physical violence once they feel disrespected.
"I have 3 kids - they're 16, 18, and 20 right now and I felt the EXACT same way as you describe. It would take a hell of a lot of money for me to go back to that stage of parenting. It's lonely and exhausting and makes you question everything you're doing at all times. That being said, I feel like I missed so much by focusing on wanting them to get to the next stage instead of trying to enjoy where they were. My middle child especially - my only daughter - I feel like I missed so much of her toddlerness and babyhood because I was so busy dealing with her younger brother needing me as an infant/baby or her older brother being rambunctious and into everything and then starting school and all those new adventures. She was sort of always just there and independent and learned how to be from observation. I never even potty trained her. She just did it herself by watching me potty train her brother. Having three was crazy so I know my experience was different.... but my advice is to record everything you can. Get her voice on audio, take pictures, take video, and enjoy the snuggles because they definitely stop. I know it's cliche but this stage is over in a minute and it only happens once.       The best thing I did was put her in girl scouts when she was 5. I met other moms with kids the same ages and found scout moms to be a lot less competitive and more down to earth than sports moms. My youngest is now in competitive marching band in high school and so far band moms are the most judgemental cliquey jerks I've ever come across."
Saw that someone invited me to their Facebook page. The page was about them. They post like three times a day. They aren't famous. I barely even know them.
Parents who have to brag about their own children's achievements. Throughout senior year I volunteered to help out at the elementary school a lot and you'd always get these parents at the end of the day who'd be talking about how their kids were in martial arts or were already able to speak multiple languages. Things that really aren't impressive in the long run but they seem to think so.

"Yes, this wonderful, mythical reddit of which you speak was so tolerant that it created, and allowed to flourish, hate subs like ""fatpeoplehate"", ""t\_d"", ""shitredditsays"", the list goes on. These hate groups continue to thrive here in various ways, of course, despite some of them being banned (several of the most egregious though more than a few survive) or restricted (which is like reddit saying, ""ok hate and racism, brigading and spamming, trolling and promoting misinformation are perfectly fine so long as we make it slightly harder for people to find said communities""). But this idea that reddit was once a utopia of love and acceptance is nonsense."
"All the cleavage people feel they need to show. I understand having a large chest and naturally a little cleavage will peak through.

Not sure who needs to hear this but that's not the  attention you want."
"You can tell the truth without hurting people. And if they still feel hurt by the truth, it's their problem.  I remember I unfriended people because they would lie about some shit and it was easy to see.

When I told her that he's not that crazy, she accused me of being archaic and over sexualizing any interaction between men and women."

"I talked to this guy at the bar today, well he talked to me, but somewhere in the middle of our conversation those two pretty russian girls walk by. I cant help but notice ...so did he. The conversation topic now was about girls and the first thing he said was: I swear if I didnt have to work today, I would bang those girls. I ve been around for 30 days in this hotel (im on vacation and he is hotel staff) and I ve banged like 14 girls.   I was just listening and thinking to myself : ""definitely...you sure did."".    But what struck me most is, I used to be that guy too...I would brag about girls I didnt fuck, hell some of them I only knew from the internet. Now, I can say that I have a healthy sexual Lifestyle. And I dont run around bragging about girls I had sex with. I just enjoy.   Also, I am by no means a gigolo. But I meet girls and I am just who I am and sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesnt."

Blasting your fucking music through your car at a red light. Thinking that everyone else wants to hear it
Making new players 1v1 you in a game you've played forever. It just shows you want to win a game for once and can't do so without being against people who can't play.
Something I like to call “Motorcycle Masturbation”. I define it as the constant need for a guy to rev his bike at a red light or anywhere he stops with a crowd nearby to draw attention to himself. I know bikes enough that properly tuned this is not necessary.  Thought of this in Banff on the Main Street a number of years ago in the middle of a beautiful sunny day and this idiot at every light and stop sign “played” with his bike with a stupid ass grin on his face. Annoying everyone trying to enjoy the day in the mountains. He literally looked like he was going to cream his leathers. Near the end of the street where there were few people he did not do it and his bike idled just fine.
Cant really fully fault people about that. Someone being wrong or lacking knowledge about something is often used as a way to put them down.
People that scream “I’m very insecure”
"Telling other people what kind of person you are on a regular basis.  ""I'm a feminist"" ""I'm an LGBTQ ally"" ""I'm not a racist (but...)""  People who profess frequently their qualities are actually offering you their sales pitch of who they want to be perceived as.  If you are something, the people it matters to will recognise that quality in you."
This this this. Having a lifted &amp; kitted out truck doesn't automatically make you an asshole.   Being an asshole makes you an asshole.

"Trying to embarrass someone (usually someone they see as more successful than them) in front of people they want to be liked by.  Just had this happen where the insecure person asked about my profession in front of others, interrupted me several times when I tried to explain what I do and then when I just went quiet because I got annoyed they told me I didn't have to be nervous.  We were at a fair and I was standing in front of a banner with a giant logo on it. I wasn't nervous. If I couldn't explain what we do I wouldn't have been there."

I've only recently gotten to the point that I'll go through my girlfriend's purse to find something.

I just bought a midsized truck, purposely not getting one bigger than I need, but the very first comment was from a coworker saying ""why do you need a truck?"" followed closely by ""as long as you don't lift it!"". Then a few days later when I was showing it to another coworker with the same truck and the same person comes up like ""How does it handle those rugged Las Vegas Blvd terrain?!"".  I stopped trying to explain that there's a world outside of our city. Just ""I wanted the shit."" and nothing else. They can think I have a small dick when I modify it. Not my problem."

I think a lot of people here are confusing being an asshole with being insecure. I know I am pretty insecure about myself but I dont have a lot of the traits people are pointing out. It is possible to be insecure about yourself with out being an asshole to others.
"Never, ever, ever admitting that you’re wrong.   And then - when you’re proved wrong - saying that actually, you never said that."
"Bashing others and obsessing over small annoying things they do. Often, if you find something about someone annoying it’s because you hate that about yourself. An example: Kid is insecure about her body. Goes to other kid and calls them fat to feel better about themselves being “fat”. Example 2: Kid has parent that doesn’t care about them, goes to kid with supportive and loving parents and calls them a mama’s kid. Makes sense, right?"

"Pulling clothes away from your body, insecure about body weight."
"Tones of dudes I’ve  known have talked mad shit about people behind their back. They just didn’t think of it as gossip because “that’s what girls do”.

"Yep. I don't know if this has been posted yet, but there's a psychological principle based around that concept. It's the Situational vs Dispositional view of Human Behavior. People are more likely to make assumptions of other's personalities on one individual circumstance, but rationalize what they do as being ""just situational.""   For instance, say you get cut off in traffic or someone passes you going 100mph. You'll likely be thinking something to the effect of, ""oh what a dickhead. There's other people on the road."" But when you speed and drive recklessly, it's because you're late to work and if you come in late one more time your boss is going to fire you."

"Yes, I work in a very service oriented field where we have to be very accurate and precise.  I've had situations where my boss has stepped in asked me to fix something that went wrong, as well as review with the person what he or she should have done instead so they'll learn for the future and not make the same mistake next time.  I've worked with people who demean and humiliate you in front of your co-workers.  I hate being on the receiving end of that, so my mentoring/coaching style is very different.  First, I don't do it in public, I'm of the praise in public, correct in private school of thought.  I ask them why they approached it the way they did and I'll try to say something positive about how I can see why they'd think that and  I only learned through my own experiences that it's supposed to be done x way for reasons a, b, c.  And if it's a typical mistake people make as they're gaining experience, I'll mention my own experiences with it.  And if there's something they did well, even though they made an error, I'll praise them for that.  Most people respond really well to this and I've gotten feedback that I'm good at explaining things and training people.  But  now and then I do get a person who takes it as a personal attack and gets dismissive.  A couple of them have done this middle school nonsense where they refuse to acknowledge you.  As in won't say hello, etc.  I don't care so much about that, but then it becomes something I have to let my boss know if they refuse to take the feedback into consideration.  I hate having to get my boss involved, I'd rather talk one on one with someone like an adult than have to get my boss involved.  I'd much rather go back to my boss and say the person understood the feedback and learned from the situation.       I give unsolicited compliments about my colleagues (my level, as well as senior and junior) because I know that can help someone when it comes to performance review time.  I'd much rather have something good to say about someone than something negative."
"Yeah I’ve spent around 4 years studying almost exclusively Native American tribes, specifically southern ones, and I’ve met people who have spent their fucking *lifetime* studying it. Like 50+ years. Shit I remember meeting the researcher whose work I had been reading for 4 years and being astounded at how she knew every little aspect of the subject as if it was her day to day life. That’s when I realized it *was* her day to day life and it finally clicked in my head about just how serious these people are in their fields. It’s not just learning a subject, you basically incorporate something into your life. It engulfs you and becomes who you are almost entirely. So you can’t go into doctorate territory for petty reasons like “wanting to be the smartest in the room”. You need to genuinely care about the subject.   Which is why I think OP’s brothers issues aside, he probably used the “smartest person in a room” thing as a poor joke. Anyone with a doctorate in something genuinely cares about the subject enough for it to become a part of them."
Like u/OnceATable said lying about stuff to seem cool but also lying about small things like what you did during the weekend small stuff about your life that you think other people wouldn’t think was cool even tho they might. It’s just all in their head about what other people think. At this point in my life I don’t care and I’m done caring for what other people think of me and I’m happy with who I am but everyone who dose that just haven’t found that yet

And you know what the cold part is?  I am actually VERY insecure about my looks (overweight, weird face, etc), but at my age (late 40's), I have made peace with my unconventional looks so my attitude is much closer to ""fuck it"", and I have more important issues to deal with.  I only see myself as competent where my work is involved, and for the most part, other than being professional-level friendly, I pretty much just tried to stay out of the way.

And my husband was still working. Big mistake, as the sweet nurse is trying to ask me how I'm doing, she launches into her pregnancy and birth experiences. Essentially trying to one up me. So we all just sat that awkwardly and let her finish. I never asked her for that kind of help again."

Mocking someone based on a closed sense of superiority
Go to school in the Bible belt. Lots of kids are fucking in high school just based on the number of teen pregnancies alone.
"Ah yeah. My wording wasn't quite correct, I think what I meant is I've been taking steps to try and look at things from a different perspective because I was being so negative that it was making my experience of everything negative so I was being unnecessarily mean and shitty about most things. I'm definitely not an optimist and I don't think it's possible to stop being jaded. But Ive started trying to think about and approach things differently because how I was wasn't working for me. Plus it helps me be less selfish which has undoubtedly made me less terrible to be around. I guess I've just realised I'm very lucky for a lot of things. And even more than that I'm very grateful.   Haha idk I'm a bit scatterbrained but I'm also trying to work on that.  You're absolutely right about it being important on where you decide to direct all that energy I guess.

ok? so insecurity is common?
"I'd put money on a few of them liked you, it just creates a stand off situation where if anyone goes for it it'll blow up the friend group.  knew one girl who turned out was also kind've a massive pervert I was outside the friend group, so she felt safe telling me her weird machiavellian schemes to basically arrange a gangbang. She had sex work as a childhood dream so yeah, she was a unique case."

Literally screaming “I’m very insecure”
"Like r/IdiotsInCars . I've have a few times when I've done some stuff that could have easily landed me on there, but it's at a time that I'm having the worst fucking day and so stressed out that I make bad decisions or carelessly miss a turn and then freak out or try to make a tight merge. Like any other day I would just *miss the turn,* and gone back, but since I'm already super stressed out I dont think clearly."
"Lying about dumb shit to make yourself look better or more interesting.  I understand you're trying to get people to like you, but when everything that comes out of your mouth is bullshit, nobody trusts you and there's nothing real to relate to you about - two things that every relationship, from acquaintance to romantic, is built on. In the end, you're really doing yourself a disservice. Just be yourself."
I mean they do have a lot of proof in the form of direct quotes. I wouldn’t say being insecure makes him “bad” though. There’s tons of other evidence to prove him to be bad

"Getting impatient or irritated with someone for not texting a response immediately.  I treat texts like I used to treat voicemails.  I answer in bulk when I have some downtime, so my phone does not play a constant companion in my life.  If it's urgent, hit 'dial'."

"Exactly! And I think it's easy for bitter people to attack people who they perceive as just ""wanting attention"" when in reality I just wanna be able to strike up a quick, easy friendship where we can sit around and banter insults and play games together. I have no issue with being friends with a similar girl but I think they're far less common.  Not saying me being a ""less common"" kind of girl is some sort of special or desirable inherent quality of mine either (and the fact I have to defend it like that says a lot...). It's just not as common with girls my age, and I don't pick my friends based on gender, I do it based on how well I get along with them with the least amount of effort  But there will always be bitter guys attacking me for that because I'm totally just trying to get male attention 🙄 like I wouldn't get a sex change to ""none"" if that was an option..."

Noticing and mentioning flaws in other people a lot.  The more insecure someone is the more they do it.
"You must have met my brother, sorry about that."
"I hired a guy sometime last year and his wife started calling me and my boss (the owner) to make sure he wasn't cheating on her. She called him 4 or 5 times a day and almost every time was ""where are you, what time are you getting off today, can you come home now, why can't [my name] take care of it?"" I work on a 24/7 as needed emergency crew and you take the hours when they're there so you never really know what your schedule looks like day to day.   He was only with me 3 months and in that time she:  * turned off his alarms and made him late for work  * called the cops on him during a fight and called me at 2am to ask if I could cover for him and maybe help with bail  * called the boss and told him he smoked weed (because they got in an argument)  * tore out the breathalizer from his car and got him locked up- then called me with sob stories about how mean he was to her and can we hang out sometime  I set her straight one time by telling her I don't care about your personal life, I'm not your friend, and I'm not doing anything out of my way at the drop of your hat because you decide you want to throw a fit. The guy comes in the next day asking if we could go by his house for lunch because she wanted an apology. I gave him the day off. Good times."

He basically said he met a random girl, hooked up with her  and literally sucked all of the air out of her lungs. I also found out from my friends who went to the concert that he literally never left their side all night, including to go to the bathroom, so there was no way he could have hooked up with anyone in that time.

Went for wakeboarding this weekend? Well his uncle has a brand new wakeboard boat and went to Lake Powell for a week this summer.  A lot of what he said his uncle would let him do we're outright lies that I would fact check with his cousin I was also friends with. It got to the point where if his uncle came up, it was a ""That's crazy, man."" Situation.  Thankfully he got better when he was out of high school and on his own and didn't really have a hug group of peers to try and impress, but there for a few years after, he was constantly going through cars because this one wasn't cool enough or whatever."

That’s a good one too because I always use driving to explain to the dunning Kruger effect to people.  People seem to think that it has to do with innate intelligence but it’s more about competence. Very few people will admit they are below average drivers but statistically that cannot true.

When I introduced him to my other friend (Yeah, I got only two close friends. Sue me.) my other friend didn't catch on to the fact and genuinely believes that our new friend is a total playboy.   And the funny bit is that out of the three of us he genuinely is the most good looking, interesting and oddly confident one. He has a lot of interesting hobbies, he takes care of himself and has never seemed ashamed of himself in any way besides obviously being a virgin. I get the feeling that his inexperience is really bugging him, and I can't wait until he meets someone and mellows out. I don't have the heart to or even the need to talk to him about it. I reckon that with time it will fix itself."

"I did this as a child, lied about going on holiday because I never went anywhere else besides my grandmother's house. Said I always had plane tickets lying about the house and stuff. I lied about a lot of things to fit in and sound more interesting- really despised all those things irl. Besides that, never really could state what I wanted loud and clear, I would always beat around the bush. Never had it in me to say this is what I want and I want it this way. Couldnt say no either. Eventually just agreed with whatever people would say. Honestly people are so confused about what I like and what I don't just because I could never speak my mind. Also odd but a lot of things like grooming hair and makeup and stuff were so taboo in my household that I just ended up being way too repressed or doing things on the sly. Which also made me super insecure about everything, so I had to act all nonchalant about the way I looked and carried myself.  But yea, ik better now. I can talk about things openly and I'm no longer ashamed of the things that I haven't experienced. People are really nice if you tell them it's your first time doing something instead of pretending to be an expert about everything. Being honest and forthcoming is truly liberating.     I've a friend who made up the most ridiculous story of being an undercover secret agent with a fugitive cousin. Would've left it at that, but this buddy of mine came up with more and more fabrications- bringing in maps to school, talking about secret meetings and assignments. One time he called me up and told me his other spykid friend had been totally debilitated by some biometric virus, that it was imperative that he go see her, and that there was no antidote, she had only a few hours to live. I know for a fact that he wasn't trolling me back then, he knew I didn't believe him, but idk, one moment he'd be all crazy conspiracies and the next he'd act like he didn't just unload all of that on us. We're pretty close rn, and if I bring up any of the things he told me back then he doesn't show any recognition really. If I ask about the cousin (not mentioning any of the bogus stuff) he'll just shrug it off and say they don't keep in touch anymore. It honestly feels surreal. Maybe I'll ask him again one of these days."

"I live in the Bay Area up in the mountains and commute down into the valley.  You don't need that shit anywhere around here.  All the deep woods are off-limits to unauthorized vehicles (e.g. you need to be with a gov agency to get a vehicle out there, assuming there's even a damn road).  Most mountain roads, even out in the sticks are good enough that you can get a FWD sedan around them.  They're not really the off-road trucks you're thinking about.  There's plenty of them, but there's tons of a very specific type of truck that I think celtic1888 is referring too.  Also, most of these trucks aren't lifted for off-road.  They'll have spacers so the axles look 8' wide and maybe a shitty body lift.  You'll get a pretty good look at their bone-stock transaxles following them through 10 mph traffic.  They're fucking edgelord country dickheads who can't cope with a world that doesn't give a flying fuck about them."
"We've got a chef at work. Amazing cook. Hard worker. Funny guy. Constantly lies about things to seem cool.   Server ' I did acid last weekend'  Chef 'I did 15 double pressed tabs my first time so I'll never do it again'   I mean, it's cool if you did some drugs and had a bad trip, but seriously - nobody starts off like that. And it's ALWAYS stories like that. ""I worked 37 hours in a row and then drove from Canada to Mexico non stop drinking nothing but redbulls"" - no you didn't and it's OK to have cool stories, but you didn't punch a marine so hard in the heart that he died but it's cool cuz nobody found out."

"I used to be like that in my teenage years. Not that I was unhappy, far from it. I was just genuinely sadistic."
"For a long time, I see myself on camera or video through social media and such through my friends, I look at myself and just thought I don't look attractive at all and don't bother to try to talk to girls who look drop dead gorgeous when I go out.   Time goes on and after a bad break up, I was going through a ""fuckboy"" phase of just being confident and all and just didn't let my looks bother me. So when I do get social and play it off cool, girls I met tend to have a crush on me and actually do try to make their move. I never thought that it happens. I'm not trying to toot my own horn either because I do tend to be a flirt but I never had a physical relationship. To this day I still see myself disgusting sometimes but then again, just have to play it cool in the end"

"As someone with a history of insecurity (I get better every year), I remember not knowing what kind of person I wanted to be, so I just chose someone and decided to be like them. Imagine my surprise when I didn’t like myself all that much! I’d also say telling more stories about other people than ones about yourself and following the same person/ people around at a party are pretty big indications. Then again, my ineptitude at remembering names and recognizing faces may contribute to the second one more than insecurity. Though, I could also argue that that causes me insecurity."

"This. Once I notice this pattern from someone, I just tend to steer clear talking to them.  I'm actually dealing with someone like this right now. She's my colleague and at the same time my roommate. We share rent and utilities because it's cheaper that way. When I first met her she just striked me as the dominant, sort of bossy type. I never thought of it too much. Then I noticed whenever we would talk she has this habit of cutting me off because she just has to say what was on her mind but it didn't really piss me off at first because I just thought maybe she's just like that and I let it go. She also has this habit of speaking in behalf of me or others like if someone asks me something directly, before I could speak up and answer she would then answer for me as if she knows what I was about to say. That really irked me so much when it happened the first time and just didn't say anything about it. Then one time we were just hanging out like normal and I was a bit excited to tell her about this encounter I had with a guy (just some normal girl talk) and the next thing I know she was one upping my experience with what she had with this guy she's been communicating with for a year and the conversation just turned to her talking about him and the guy. I get it she was rather happy talking about it but it seemed that she never actually cared with what I had to say. Another occurence was when I shared to her about the extremely busy shift I had (we're colleagues and we do the same work). She instantly cut me off saying that nothing was busier and more hectic than her shift the other day and at that point I just shut my mouth and didn't say anything about what happened to my busy day. That was probably when I realized that there's no point engaging with a conversation with her at all. I don't know if she's oblivious to the fact that she does those things. I'm not saying she's a bad person. She has some good qualities but she just has this grating personality that gets me sometimes.   I don't talk to her so much anymore and I think she noticed it and she doesn't talk to me so much either. I'm fine with it really. Sorry for this long reply. I just felt the need to share this."

If someone flirted with my husband, didn't know he was married and backed off when she found out I would find it funny.  Plot twist though, I found out later my coworker was an absolute dog and was constantly cheating on his wife, wife just always blamed the other woman and never her asshole husband"

The funny thing about that is that all kids operate at the genius level until they're about 4... Their brains are developing so fast and they are learning so much in that timeframe.  Kids develop different things at different times but they are all developing.  That doesn't make their kid special.  Best thing you can do for them is not bragging about how fast they are learning but by giving them lots of different things to study and learn.

If there is nothing going on, it really shouldn't matter. But the number of people who suspect something, snoop once, and find out they were right, is far too high to rule it all out. If they're snooping constantly without reason, then it's a problem. But it isn't always a sign the snooper is insane or evil.

"The behaviors I've seen in some obese people. The more insecure ones may have exaggerated ""manners."" They may say excuse me to empty chairs rather than people. I can think of several reasons for that, such as not feeling they can look someone in the eye, or not feeling they are worthy enough to speak to a person directly.  They may move several times the necessary distance for others beyond any politeness standards. Sometimes that is from a sense of shame, a fear of condemnation, fear of possibly hitting someone, or maybe a chip on their shoulder.  Or they have low standards for dating. They could be desperate for attention. They are not exactly looking for sex, but if that's the cost to get some semblance of care and affection, they'd go along with it. This is likely what leads to some of the interracial dating stereotypes, like a big (or unattractive) White woman being with a ""scrub"". It all stems from a deep feeling of oneself being unlovable. Now don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with being charitable or having attractions outside of ""accepted"" parameters if that is truly what it is. The issue is when one is deeply wounded inside to the point of feeling that they don't have choices or options, and are really at some level seeking people they can take from.  Or they have excessive fear. One time, a large guy brandished a knife around me because he didn't like the conversation. Why would he need a knife? If he wanted to be aggressive, he could have sat on me. So at a core level, he felt inadequate and insecure."

"After reading through all of these comments, am I not insecure or am I just not that much of an asshole?"
This entire thread is a personal attack lol.
I got molested as a child and have anger issues stemming from it.  Tell her u/PoopieMcCuckface said to up her game.
"Are you upset because I swore, or because I said upvoting and downvoting is not bullying?"
"Someone who screams ""I am very insecure"""
This type of thinking is a cognitive bias called the fundamental attribution error.  Pretty interesting insight if anyone wants to know more about it https://youtu.be/Y8IcYSrcaaA
"1.) Bragging about what little you've done that's cool when you're talking to someone less fortunate than you in those regards because you feel it's your only chance to prove you're cool because most everyone else seems cooler and more fortunate than you are.   2.) Not standing up for yourself to avoid confrontation; putting your feelings and wants aside for what others want.  3.) Liking the idea of people being envious of you because it proves how cool and desirable you are.  4.) Constantly seeking validation that people actually do like you.  5.) Looking for flaws in others to feel better about yourself.   6.) Being easy to take advantage of with flattery because someone made you feel important, even if their intentions are bad.  7.) Desperately hoping that at least one person is worse than you at something or is lamer than you just so you can remind yourself that at least you aren't ""that bad.""  These are things I'm guilty of and absolutely hate about myself. I'm working on them. Social anxiety and insecurity are a horrible pair."
would you say that stuff in front of your gay friends though?
"Eh, she has her moments. “There’s a chicken sandwich that if you eat it means you hate gay people.” That is the height of insecurity. And yes, I’m talking to you, half of Reddit."
"""I'M VERY INSECURE!"""
Donald Trump while he sleeps.
there's literally tens of thousands of recent answers if you'd just bother to use the [search function](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/search?q=screams+insecure&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
So true 😹
As a mom...I totally agree.
As a mom...I totally agree.
Friend: *at my house*. Dad: *yells at me*. Me:*looks at friend and starts crying*.
Spouting things like this is exactly why men have a harder time expressing their emotions. Continuing the cycle.
"Happy cake day, math person."
I am very insecure!
"Pffff, glad im not one of them, *starts to sweat*"
"by saying ""why would he/she be with them. I'm much better for them"""
"Man, I'd be friends with you. I totally understand it. We love our kids but we are thoroughly exhaused. Lol"
I totally get that not everyone that has this problem is insecure and not everyone that is insecure has this problem.
Well I clapped 39 cheeks last night
I'm the same way.  My wife loves this age (thank God) but i want to do science experiments and daddy daughter dates and help with homework and actually play outside instead of just chase her around till she's tired
"&gt;so he can officially be the smartest person in the room  Hahahahahahaaaa. Man, the idea that a Phd can do that for someone probably makes him the dumbest person in a lot of rooms."
"That's like me and my friends tho tbh. ""Pussy I got 3 hours"""
"You are not alone.  My kids are older,  20 down to 11.  I have gone through and going through the phases and I can't even lie, i miss the toddler years. I dont miss the shitty parts of toddler years at all.  I miss the little moments. They don't even want bedtime stories. Hugging mom in public? Make it quick my friends might see.    Maybe if we started venting to our friends about the shitty part we might do better in the long run. Its not all sunshine and rainbows. Its endless fighting about what they can wear in public that is appropriate, it's constantly worrying if they are going to leave the house in a tantrum and take off for good.   It's worrying about whether your sixteen year old has actually listened to your advice about not drinking and driving,  not doing drugs and getting a good education.    I can go on and on. Perhaps if other moms were real about the struggles we could get back to helping each other and raising well rounded decent human beings."
Someone screaming “I’m very insecure!”
Vice versa
Always speaking about yourself.
Face tattoos
"Usually me, unless i am drunk."
"I'm not insecure, you are."
"Alright, which one of you cheated? That’s what I always think when I see those"
You just go up to strangers and tell them they have a small dick? I sense some insecurity.
People who only point out negatives in others or always have gossip to spread. 99% of the time they are projecting their own insecurities.
"Those who still do this after high school are almost always maladjusted, miserable people. People who are successful and happy rarely have the motivation to do stuff like this. They're usually too busy to do stuff like that anyways."
"How about if someone talks about how terrible they are and how many women they have fucked and disappointed? I had a friend who did this and I was never sure if he was insecure, or just really fucking self secure."
Using Reddit
I had a colleague who basically tried to end every sentence for you and seemed to agree on everything. That screamed insecurity to me.
"Someone that constantly tries to relate to you in anyway. I have a co worker that does this. I said ""oh I have to go to the bank and get change"" and she'd go ""oh yes I have to go to the bank as well"" or one of our co workers had kidney stones and she butted into the conversation saying ""oh yes I had a kidney stone over the weekend those are not fun, but I still went to the fair"". Just drives me bonkers but she also butts into every single conversation as well even if we're not talking to her."
Only in fucking Canada lmao  I thought us (posh) Brits and you guys were equals in being apologetic. I was very wrong it seems haha
"My brother and his wife share one because my brother refused to get one for years. Meanwhile she has friended all their friends and family. So my brother used hers to talk to people and they finally ""converted"" it last year. Ironically my brother uses more than her now."
"Revving your enormous truck through the neighborhood. We get it, you are compensating."
Of course they think that. Since they are constantly judging others it's only natural for them to assume others are doing the same.
Me
"I had an ex do that, turns out she was one of two arguable psychopaths I've encountered in my life. And I came to find out through different tidbits of information that she was probably lying about it."
"See, I'm really unhappy but I'm the complete opposite. I almost always try to see the good in people, or think of a reason why they would do something like that"
"I used to bully this brown kid by getting better grades than him, The best bullies encourage others around them to better themselves"
"Sounds like my situation... I was best friends with her boyfriend years before they met, yet every day she was trying to accuse him of cheating on her with me (🙄) even made him choose between us.... He chose her, and was made to essentially cut off every female friend he had, she had to have constant access to his phone.... Only for her to cheat many times (including a few times with her ex).... this was all after he moved in, and proposed to her......"
"""IM VERY INSECURE""!!!!"
Telling other people's stories and observations as yours.
"Caring what some stranger says about you,  especially online."
"&gt;I want her to be nine so we can talk bout real people stuff, like what shows she likes...   This made me sad."
You legit believe he is illiterate?
Pointing out other people’s insecurities and trying to make them feel insecure
"Ive been working out a lot recently. I just got new tribal tattoos on my shoulders. I started wearing tank tops too. Friends think it helps with my insecurity, but oh man it does not. Like at all. I like that shit but now I feel like it's harder for me to hide my insecurities."
Those mufflers people put on their shit tier car to make it stupid loud.
Tattoos.
"Anybody that claims another person ""is a virgin"" in virtually every disagreement they have."
Generally means one of the was fucking around behind the others back tbf
"""Um"""

"Missed opportunity for ""your"""
"""I'm very insecure"""
yea CHINA
I was married to him. Sorry for both of us!
*cries in tongue piercing*
"Yea, was really toxic. Now single and happy"
"Being super ""hard"" and trying to look like a real banger"
haha love it!!!
Bragging about how much money you make multiple times a day.
How would that make him the smartest person in the room?  I don’t get that line of thinking. It just shows people who decided to keep going to school for a long period of time and pay a bunch of money for degrees.
"if they wear hoodies all the time, go to the bathroom a lot, Keep their hair Natural by just brushing it and their done, wear mostly the simple outfits"
"Looking at people and then trying to look away the second they look at you, our eyes can look up into the sky and see stars in the fraction of a second, what makes you think that they won’t see you looking dead at them... (sadly I know this from personal experience)"
"That’s the worst - when people don’t take your mental issue seriously because you don’t “look” messed up. Whatever that means. Like, do I gotta schlop around in dirty clothes with poor hygiene to fit the mold of what a mentally disordered person looks like? What gives."
Molding/reinventing ones self to match a crush...and doing this continuously.
"&gt;I would get so invested in a lie that I would eventually end up believing it and it would become my reality.  If it makes you feel better, that's actually *super* easy to do, even by accident, and 100% of people have done this before. Most people don't do this often enough (or intentionally enough) to make it a pathology, but it's part of the human condition."
"Sometimes overweight people develop a loud, intimidating, or agressive personality, and in the worst cases become bullies. It’s tragic if you recognize it."
a lot of self deprication. not like the “you’re pretty” “no i’m not”. i mean the one where you have full blown arguments about how you don’t look nice.
Legends say I'm still working on it to this day. Mom needs something to brag about yanno.
"Then why fucking stay, at that point? Like, my ex used to do this to me. We had a rocky start and I messed up, we fought, I apologized, he forgave me, we took a while to get back to a good place between us. But then, whenever we got into a fight after that, he would bring it up! Like, you forgave me, you don’t get to use it like a weapon anymore! If you still feel fucked up over it, LEAVE. THERES THE DOOR. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO STAY."
'I'm friends with rich people' you'd be surprised by how common this is.
"My brother and I roast on eachother all the time, but infront of other pelple we are the others hero and inspiration. The roasting is funny to us, because we both know that we admire the other and it is all in jest."
Getting horribly offended on behalf of others.
Me
"That's so counterintuitive to me. Like, maybe not draw attention to something you're hiding?  I'm not a jealous dude though by nature. I've had a total of only 3 serious long term relationships and I've been pretty up front about not caring a lot about spur of the moment cheating. If you fuck up, be honest about it and as long as you don't have a kid or an STD no biggie. My dude friends think that's insane but the other side of the coin is that I know before getting serious that I'm getting the same understanding and respect and I haven't ever cheated or been cheated on, and I don't get stuck with crazy jealous assholes. My wife and I (before we were married) actually did a hall pass on the condition that it wasn't someone we would be emotionally invested in. Sex is sex. It's far from a solid foundation for a loving relationship."
"A Master brand lock, apparently."
"This may sound like ""wow thanks I'm cured"" material.. but have you tried the Ketogenic diet? gave me the energy to pull myself out of a pretty dark place... good luck !"
"""Ah.  I think I've found the problem with yours"""
"Sure, in your house (assuming you trust your friends and family of course)."
"Usually: ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH HELP ME"""
"Constantly talking about your poor health, medications being taken and hospital visits. We get it, you have health stuff - as do we all - you shouldn't rely on it as an excuse for not doing anything. There's a huge difference between me asking how you are (essentially a greeting) and you giving me a run down of all your bodily functions.   I mean seriously, wtf Julie? Gross."
"Someone screaming ""I'm very insecure""."
I just don't get why I see so many giant lifted trucks. I live in Kansas. Why do so many people need an all-terrain vehicle? And 95% of the time they're perfectly clean and have an empty truck bed.
Okay cousin fucker

"When you obviously like her and she says, ""do you like me?"" And you say no because your awkward."
So like supporting a sport team or patriotism?
"People who always play the victim and think they have to one up every bad situation for attention.  People who care about their instagram and Twitter follower ratios.  Needing to wear and have expensive things, showing them off.  Apologizing for everything."
"Adding ""...I think"" to something you definitely KNOW."
My dad has a bigger dick than your dad
"When people brag about how expensive something they bought was.  Ha, jokes on you! My shoes do the same thing but cost A LOT less."
"Deflecting everything and instead asking a lot of questions  It's generally thoughtful and a welcome change of pace, but I used to do this and for me it came from not feeling comfortable opening up about myself"
Thug kids with a $2000 car and a $6000 stereo.  It's like they need to makeup for their shit box with a loud ass annoying stereo and let the worlr know about it.
Not making eye contact.
Phd programs for most sciences are 5 years straight out of undergrad. If you pass orals then quit it’s called “ mastering out” because they just give you a masters.   Getting a masters is not required prior to getting in those programs since you basically do it then.  Edit
I also had some bitch named Sarah cheat on me. Fuck Sarah.

Huh?
"Oh right, in these situations I guess it's good to not care. I thought you were talking about others' opinions in general, including your manager's opinion at work, and such, you know, people that better have good opinion about you.  You know, if you never try to adjust and just say ""fuck other's opinions"", then you're going to have a tough life..."
"Trying to force someone to change seats with you for the ONE HOUR flight because you got separated from your significant other.  Co-dependent, much?"

"I don’t know man, I wouldn’t talk to guys about their dicks, no matter what the size. That seems kinda gay my dudes"
Arthur Dent.  Genghis Khan took a load away from him.
Asking what makes you look insecure on askreddit.
This kind of post
My husband has told me his like six times and I just can't be bothered to remember it. He knows mine though.
Bragging and putting others down about things they are passionate about or just like
"Amen.  From the very beginning I've said I want a 5yo+, not a baby / toddler. These first years are just the gauntlet we run to get to the good stuff.  You're not alone.   P.S. I love my daughter yada yada yada..."
Truck nuts.
Being a Conservative.
"If you stay below the NTFS threshold (Win 98 or older), it's also safe, since pretty much all the old viruses and worms are gone now since they don't work on NTFS systems, and all the newer trojans and malware are written for newer systems. I can't remember which YouTuber it was, but I watched one where he tried to get a virus and couldn't by hooking, I think, a Win 98 se system to the Internet. I'll see if I can find it."
"You could ignore it, force it out. Or you could let yourself understand that you’e human, you’re not perfect, you fuck up. But you’re probably also pretty great in a lot of ways, i bet more ways than you let yourself realize if you’re anything like me. You’re also a work in progress. Let yourself be imperfect as long as you’re always actively trying to be a good person. One thing that keeps me on the right side is i stopped aiming for 100%. Or even 90%. Just aim for making yourself 1% better than you were before. If you go to bed 0.5% better person than you were when you woke up, you had yourself a pretty successful day, be proud. But if you’re not better than you were, that’s OK too, acknowledge it, learn from it, then move on, try again the next day."
It’s so gross to me that people use how many different genitals you mash yours into as a measure of value.
It's okay...people love you...probably.
"""I'm an architect"""
I'd say so.  I do that too sometimes.
"The problem with this plan is that in the process of getting a PhD you become acutely aware of how little you actually know. It'd be pretty hard to get one while still honestly believing both a) that you're the smartest, and b) that your PhD is proof of that."
Yup. But sometimes comparing milestones quietly is a good thing... if you’re almost 3 year old isn’t speaking at all or is heavily lagging behind others bring that shit up with your doctor! I’ve heard some moms reassure others who’s kid may be slow to hitting milestones “my oldest took forever to master XYZ” but the competitive bullshit is super hella dumb.
"&gt; ""my cute bae what would I do without you &lt;emoji&gt; &lt;emoji&gt;""  Only two emojis?  Are they even trying to pretend to love each other? Got to pretend their relationship is a MLM with no less than 37 emoji  :)"
One upping
"My cat was peeing in the shower earlier this year.  Turns out I had gotten one of those top entrance litter boxes that they have to hop up onto (that are good for making it harder to drag litter out on the floor), and I think she's just getting old enough where it's easier just to shit and piss in the tub.  Plus it sort of resembles a litter box (at least material-wise), so that was enough to set her over the edge.  Got a front loading litter box again, and hasn't gone in the shower once."
What would be an example of this?
Guys who constantly have to talk about their dick size.
LMAO
"My daughter walked at 9 months and my son at 10 months. They're 14 and 16 now and show no special athletic ability (or interest) but they were small. My mom own/ran daycares and her theory was a combination of balance and weight. She noticed the larger kids usually took longer to pull themselves up and walk. My kids were/are small, thin kids, always in the 10-15% percentile for height and weight."
i do this because i'm a trans guy and i need to get a double mastectomy AND because i'm insecure about my body! take that!
There are some people who have been tremendously unhappy and unsatisfied in past relationships Who post a lot about how happy they are in their new relationship. I think people like that get a little bit of a pass. I think it’s great to see someone finally happy when they have been so miserable for so long
Wtf...
"If someone wants to dress like that, go ahead, no ones stopping you. I'd never have that confidence in a hundred years."
I know a girl from my school and she used to cut herself. One time she got into an argument with another girl and she wanted to compete and see who could self harm the most
That and train horns.
bragging about dick size every chance they get. people who do this are very annoying and think people care but they really don't.
Good point. Love the username btw.
This actually isnt a wildly outlandish theory. I'll record some observations and report back next time it happens.
"And now you just told at least 7,500 people... are you gonna be ok?"
"Heavy consumerism. When you are internally fulfilled, you need less stuff."
"I literally did the same shit recently, but not for any specific reason other than health.   If you find it hard to quit, I'd like to recommend a book called the easy way to quit smoking.   They basically remind you of all the little arguments you tell yourself right before failing.   I've quit many times and after listening (I audiobooked it, 4 hours) this has been the easiest it's ever been for me. Today is day 6 and I haven't really though about smoking in a couple days minus a couple insignificant cravings. It teaches you how go deal with that pretty easy too in my opinion."
"Oh, I agree. Maybe not the only option, but the most practical. It's always apparent how young Reddit skews when stuff like this comes up and ""privacy"" is paramount, but the reality is it's just inconvenient for established, co-habiting people. There's no deep dark secrets in my Gmail anyway, just bills and Girl Scout newsletters. We'll get around to consolation eventually, it's only a minor hassle right now (that we've had 3+ years to work on lol)"
"Adult life doesnt get any better, my friend"
"Heavily photoshopping your pictures, where it aint look like you anymore."
"Spying on your significant other's cellphone.   For me, that is enough reason to break up with someone."
First thing that came to mind is makeup ...
"I’m a crew leader and I have two crew members that say I don’t deserve the job and that they’d do a better job (they’re mad at me because I actually make them work) so they try to complain to managers about everything I do, if I leave them under stocked, if I leave them over prepared, if I leave them perfectly prepared, I get a complaint. Simply because I told them “hey maybe don’t leave my night shift with completely empty freezers and fridges?” It seems like any time I tell them to work, they try to find the littlest stuff I do wrong and try to get me in trouble for it. Little do they know, I’ve been offered a manager job 3 times, when they say I shouldn’t have the position I have now."
Wearing sweaters in 90 degree weather because of your body weight
"When someone makes a remark and you immediately think they’re making fun of some aspect of you. In eighth grade they added fifth graders to the middle school(it had previously been 6-8). I was complaining about them in class. One guy goes”oh, you think you’re so great cause you’re tall?” I’m 5’8 ish. He was maybe 5’3. I didn’t mention height in what I said. I called them annoying. He always tried to act super macho and cool. I always wanted to bitch slap him. He was, and still is, really irritating. But I guess he’s also really self conscious of his height."
body shaming still sucks even if you're shaming assholes.
Homophobia
"That any opposing view about something, no matter how minor is a personal attack.   I work with someone like this, it makes it extremely difficult to conduct ssential professional conversations. Problem solving, feedback sessions, process improvement, even little things like using the experience of the whole team are all taboo conversations. It's extremely depressing and has resulting in some toxic situations.  It's like working with an abusive alcoholic, will today be a good day or a bad day? will something minor I say become a huge attack as this insecure twit digs their heels in and feels the need to aggressively defend themselves.   Would 100% not put up with this shit outside of work."
Referring to every other male in the workplace as “little shrimp” in an attempt to make his dick sound bigger. Bragging about a truck. Getting trailer mirrors despite not having a trailer hitch. Talking about how every girl he’s been with had a boyfriend then he “fucked them good and they left”. Various other facts about the other cook at work.
"Ironically, the other way around shows just such insecurity, whenever someone keeps talking about how great is around them, yet bagitalizes his own achievements."
Definitely people who try to one up others because they feel they're in a silent competition with other people. . when in reality it's more likely that their 'competition' doesnt spend more than a second thinking about them in passing.

You can go straight into a PhD program without it being a combination program. Had several friends do that straight after their bachelor's. It's very possible if you went to a research university for undergrad since you can assist in research starting as a sophomore.
"The stranger that approached me in a bar to ask if I thought her boyfriend was good looking, then continued to scream at me for looking at him. I hadn't even noticed him previously. Imagine living with someone like that!"
Ofc he's not the one hit with the dick
Is it just providing an error term for the statistic? Id think that with high school kids and sex it's gonna be pretty high.  If you have time would be great if you could give a brief explanation.
Spill it.  We want names!
"""I'M VERY INSECURE!"""
Putting down/insulting others all the time.   Bragging about oneself all the time.   Being an attention seeker.
Nah. I have a couple of friends who happen to be girls and I definitely do not wanna start dating them. They're just my friends.
"Damn, someone already put you up https://www.reddit.com/r/AwardSpeechEdits/comments/dkn20o/nae_nae/"

it's funny (and telling) that a post revealing someone's own insecurity got this many upvotes in a thread about noticing insecurity in other people.

"My MIL SWEARS that my husband was walking by 7 months. Yeah no, my son had just mastered the army crawl at that age."
"The entire point of the sub, as far as I can see it, is calling out people who are denigrating others for not being as intelligent as themselves.  It's not calling out people for being smart, it's calling out people who say they're smart whilst being obviously not so."
"My MIL SWEARS that my husband was walking by 7 months. Yeah no, my son had just mastered the army crawl at that age."
"I really don't understand parenthood, but I probably never could until I am one."
Screaming i'm very isecure
Putting others down to prop yourself up when discussing something casually or in a conversation. Or ever.
"I disagree with this solely because I'm not one to use social media. If my SO wants to use social media for the both of us, I'm cool with that. There are lots of occasions where social media is necessary (events, news updates about family/friends, photo sharing) that I wouldn't take part in because I don't use Facebook. But she does. I don't mind her just using her own but if she wants to include my name or picture on the profile to represent us both, it's cute."
"The thing I hate most about that saying is that even though it's right, there's lots of times where I don't/can't care to want to do anything. It's buuuuuullshiiiiit.  ""Let's go be hap--oh nevermind let's go back to bed."""
This isn't something that's just limited to women. It's not uncommon in abusive relationships of all types.
Some people are unable to look at themselves because if they did they wouldn’t like what they see.
I went to school in Kansas.
Full of shit?
Open carry.
"Always one-upping people on their accomplishments.   Someone says 'I just finished my degree in X a Y', to which the response is to say, 'WELL, I just went to school for this and did this', leading to a twenty minute one-sided discussion about their experiences.  One-upping is definitely a prominent display of insecurity.   Alternative example, when someone says something smart or about a fact or in any way making its seem like they know things, and people respond by stating other opinions, as a kind of 'I can make noise about this subject too'."
"It depends on the school and program. Many of the more prestigious ones near me don't offer Masters at all in most areas aside from as a consolation prize for dropouts, just PhDs. It's just assumed that *of course* the future world changers at these top schools will become as advanced as possible in their field, not ""settle"" for a Masters."

"Dude, it literally happened to my truck. Read up on the 6.4 ford and how the stupid dpf regen system works. And then tell me you think those engineers didn't make massive concessions to hit their emissions targets. I don't think they were idiots just stuck by a law made by people who don't understand how engines work."

Escapes reality and distracts their minds by going on reddit.  People who are not accepted in the real world so they go on reddit to find a sense of community.
"Not subs like that, but there are definitely a few subs where you can't post any sort of constructive criticism. Raisedbynarcs is a good example of this, someone could post a story where they are acting in a very self-destructive way, essentially making a bad situation a lot worse, where a good friend would step in and try to guide them (gently) to a better solution, but they don't allow it. I get why, it's easier to have a blanket rule than try to moderate it super closely because a lot of people are dicks, but yeah that rule does exist in quite a few very popular subs"

You hit on one of my pet peeves. Sometimes you can be the best parent possible but your kid is just an asshole. You can't blame parenting for people's behavior especially later on in life.

I am more emo than you.  All my family died,  And I'm always fucking blue.   .  Super black: Sup!   I am just emo as fuck!  My parents gave me crabs,  And there are lobsters in my butt.   .

"My husbands sister in law is always praising how my husbands niece is smart as fuck. Could do her ABC at the age of 1. And she still excels in other things at the age of 7. She can do 5th grade reading and math. Like okay, that's cool and all but now I feel bad about my kid. And he's not even near her damn age. I didn't realize it was a damn competition. Kids will do things in their own pace and I've come to terms with that. I know my little guy will get there."

"That is actually genuinely insane! I've been cheated on by every single person I've been in a relationship with. But I couldn't bring myself to do something like that. If you feel you need to do that then you're already nearing the end of your relationship.   It's funny because I've never accused someone of cheating when they haven't. My insides just seem to pick up on something and so far at 34yrs old, I've never been wrong. I guess it's a good thing but at the same time, I really don't want to experience any of that and I certainly couldn't track someone to make me feel better.   I'm glad you and your gf seem to have a healthy relationship! It could so easily not be the case! Good luck with the future, both of you!"

"Similarly, when educated people scoff at a regular person asking a question about their field, instead of being excited and explaining the concept... Those kind of put downs are a sign of insecurity in some aspect of their life."

I am anxious blatherer. Always have been. The stay at home mom has made me projectile word vomit at other adults. Not as fun as it sounds.

This can have to do with a lit more than just insecurity. Depression and other mental illnesses like BPD can damage ones self-image pretty bad.

Treating other people like shit... (Someone's people are just a**holes) but sometimes it's insecurity. I had a boss who was very insecure... She rose to a director job purely on a** kissing and bitchiness. She never wanted to be shown in a bad light... So preemptively was horrible to everyone. Would come out on the floor and scream at employees.   Also my dad was always trying to show how refined he was... So when at dinner with his  bosses or co-workers would almost always send back the wine or the food or snap at the wait staff.  People being jerks to those below them for appearances sake... One of the lowest for firms of life.

"I am not sure, but I don't think OP meant to say being emo gave them anxiety disorder, but rather that they really have anxiety disorder and it's not something ""cool"" and it doesn't make you interesting.   Emo culture isn't limited to traumatized teens and people with victim mentalities-- it's in pop culture as well (yes even outside of Tumblr). Just think of the manic pixie girl trope or the tragic beauty trope. What about the chain smoking drug seeking author trope. There are romanticized tales of self destruction and sacrifice all over TV and movies."
"I had an ex like that who cheated on me and would somehow make it my fault for been too perfect. I was 16 at the time and we'd only been officially dating for a month and i was anything but perfect, I was respectful, kind and complimented her to which that somehow constituted perfection in her eyes.   She kept this going for a couple of months each time making it out to be my problem and this was after i dumped her arse this time stating i was the best thing for her and if i didn't dump her she wouldn't be cheating on her new bf who so happened to be the guy she on me with and for this entire time i never even spoke to her but got msgs telling me she felt sorry and it was a mistake i had to change my email and get my mother to change our landline."
Screaming “I’m very insecure!”
Oh no.  Don't be like me.  Be better than me.  ;)
When I’m in classes we often have discussions and a person’s raised hand will get skipped over and eventually when we get back to them they’ll say “Oh i was just gonna say...” I always think this minimizes their point and makes them sound insecure. Act like you believe what you’re saying matters!

"Well I could) started read when I was 3/4 unsure what level, but I was reading chapter books by 5. Like babysitters club.   I speed read naturally. I can read 700-1000 words a minute depending on the subject. This is completely true - I was in a study for autism and reading speed. They kicked me out bc I screwed up their statistics and shit.   Then again, like I said above, I'm autistic. Could be a weird savant thing. My brain is shaped different.  I think my reading speed got all the Stat points my social skills was supposed to have. Also, my common sense.   I did eat grass a few times around that age cause I thought it was like salad and it tasted good to me. But I wasn't pooping myself.

You are just being insecure.
I have a work colleague that does this. He was once a top tier rugby star but once got kicked so hard his leg snapped at the knee and he kicked himself in the groin.

He has seven houses in central London that he rents out.  But still Works every possible overtime minute.

I just say if you're a dude because it tends to be easier and more acceptable for girls to find healthy coping mechanisms and talk to each other. I don't by any means think they have it easier in terms of depression and stuff. I just mean that it's usually seen as acceptable for them to seek help and support in both each other and in medical professionals.  I distinctly remember a male friend of mine getting made fun of once for always hanging out with girls and then again for going to therapy. I remember thinking at the time that it seemed like an awful thing to make fun of someone for and wish I would have said something at the time. He ended up attempting suicide later and moved schools after that

Even if the obvious sings where there, I didn’t wanna tell myself I really had it. What really ended up happening is people just thought I was looking for attention, in a way I was doing that too. Either way, talk to your friend, it may be more than it seems on the surface."

"A lot of people are saying it's when people talk themselves up and whatnot, but it's also the opposite I think.      I'm an intern at an IT company. We just shifted positions around, and now our team has a new teamleader. I only work part time as an intern, so I don't get to see everyone very often, and when I do, I'm usually pretty busy trying to catch up with what's going on.      Well, teamleader went to another worker and said, ""I don't think &lt;my name&gt; likes me."" The worker (who I am close with) told me not to worry because he's said the same thing about her at one point. He openly said that to multiple people. Not sure if he's trying to get me fired, or if he's just super insecure."

Met up with my gf at a bar and just wanted to talk to her about it, help me unpack what I’d gone through and was feeling.  Asked her if we could please go home.  Our mutual friend decided I was ruining the evening and told me so and insulted my manhood.  I told her my experience trumped her girls night out and to go away.  It wasn’t even a special night out, we were in our 20s and went out most nights."
"I've stayed in terrible relationships for longer than I should of. But it wasnt from fear of being alone, I truly enjoy being alone; If you don't like being with yourself, how could anyone else, I'm cool asf lol.

She told her daughter, who is insecure about her own body, that to look like me she'd have to starve herself, and then said I was setting a bad example for her daughter. So that's fun.

"But think about why that might be. What if she had been cheated on and betrayed in the past, and was terrified of the same thing happening?  It is toxic and it isn't good, but some empathy about what is causing that behavior could lead to her thinking it through and working through it and getting over it. It means she might need extra reassurance whole working through it. If someone is broken, we can throw them out or we can help them. Neither is right or wrong, but it isn't inherently because someone is evil."
I would catch myself doing this a lot. A LOT.  Not out of a competitive nature; gotta have the best story. But because I was trying to relate to the situation.  It took me a long time to figure out how to accomplish it without looking like a braggart.

"I have a very silly sense of humor.  I like to spout nonsense and my jokes can be self-deprecating.  Sometimes if someone new comes into my group of friends, I find that they will target and snipe at me, mistaking me for the fool I'm pretending to be.  It's not like I'm being subtle.  I'm not actually illiterate and I understand that the earth is round.  I see it as a sign of insecurity, a need to bring someone down in order to gain status in a new group."

Thank you for sharing u/littlecuckprincess
Thinking everyone is trying to get you and make you feel bad about yourself. When the truth is your only thinking that way cause you insecure that you will end up alone. I am currently trying to work on this problem. I just need to stop my mind from thinking this way and taking things into perspective.

"I've got a similar story.  My mother told me that she was worried that I wasn't hitting my milestones on time because I guess I would walk only on rare occasions, when I was at the age where I should have been flying around the house like a drunken monkey.  Turns out I was just lazy.  My mom figured out after awhile that ***I*** had figured out that if I just stayed put and didn't move she would come and pick me up when it was time to leave, or she would bring me my food when it was time to eat."

His favorite word was ""actually"". It became infuriating, anytime someone told a story, he would chime in with bogus information to make himself sound intelligent. The advent of the smartphone and thus everyone having google in their pocket really stole his thunder. The first year of pocket google was humiliating for him, his initial defense was to argue with reality. Eventually he stopped, it was glorious."

Then you have about 5-6 years during which it’s magical.  Then they go through puberty and you want to sell them until they mature - around age 30 or so.  If ever.

"By the time the kids are in high school or thereabouts, the SIL will have figured out that current size is not at all a predictor of future size. The biggest babies often grow up to be average size, and small kids often grow up to be a lot bigger and taller than you’d ever expect.   One of my son’s good friends in middle school was always chasing him height-wise, to the point where his mom was claiming he was in the “90th percentile” for his age. He was more like 40th percentile, but I didn’t say anything because it’s not a competition. By junior year of high school, his buddy shot up and passed him by a good amount. I was so happy because I finally got to stop hearing about it."

"Essentially, the autistic brain overall can have a more ""masculine"" structure. I also have a hard time understanding others' social expectations or acting the way I'm ""supposed to"". Women seem to have a MUCH bigger problem with that than men do, whether it's due to my wearing men's clothing (I have sensory issues so I need loose clothes), cursing and making gross/dark jokes, or just generally acting ""like a guy"" (you know, like how male friends are more likely to insult each other in banter as a form of bonding and stuff).  In high school, a lot of the girls, especially the more ""popular"" ones who'd never interacted with me before, started to dislike me because I was ""flirting"" with ""all of the guys"" but in reality I was just having relaxed, friendly, teasing conversations. Over time things like that and women who are older than me regularly criticizing me on what I wear or say or like or who I spend time with made me much more hesitant to be friends with girls.  My closest set of friends are female, but I met the three of them in elementary school, before there was really too much of a gender difference, personality-wise.  It actually almost reminds me of parents hating people without kids, in a way. They (not all women but a distinct subset) feel they had to conform to all the standards of what a woman ""should"" be like. And I refuse to, and I think that they dislike me for that (disclaimer: I don't think it makes me any better or worse than them, it's just who I am). The only workplace drama/issues I've ever had have ALWAYS been between me and an older woman."

"That's interesting because I've always felt like women are so easy to ""get"". I understand the social rules, I guess. If there's an issue we can actually talk about it, whereas (in my experience) guys will say ""no it's fine"" except it's not fine with them at all, but they're expected to suck it up so they don't wanna discuss it and move past it, they'll rather just ignore it if it's uncomfortable.   I'll admit I have a lot more experience befriending women because as a teenager, guys could never just be chill and always assumed I was hitting on them when I was just being friendly. Women's usually just assumed I was being friendly, so that was a lot more comfortable for me."

His films have a purpose!” Like he was validating that I didn’t proclaim Citizen Kane is the only film that matters.   That was in an Ingmar Bergman/Woody Allen perspective and I came out of that class not liking and still not understanding Bergman films."

Thing is nobody doesn't like her, they just didn't want to get all caught up in her drama so they avoided it and didn't give in when she wanted to be whiny and start drama.   Also now every conversation I have with other people when she happens to be around, she interjects and in some cases physically hangs on to the person I'm talking to. It's weird."

Honestly, the best thing you can do when you're stressed out or feeling grumpy is just be polite. I can deal with someone who's in a bad mood when they communicate that and make an effort to be at least a little pleasant. I don't mind backing off and giving them space. But if we're stuck hanging out together and you're just being an asshole it's THE WORST."

"They absolutely do - but the consequence of that isn't that high-schoolers have way less sex, it's that you'd have to do a controlled study to get any idea how much sex high-schoolers have.   Because people generally only go to 1 or 2 high schools in their lives, nobody's own experience is any good for figuring this out."

"XP was full of holes. Vista was much better and got an undeserved bad rap because it was less lean than XP due to all the new (good) features, so it required a stronger system to run it. By the time 7 was ready, common hardware was better and could run the re-branded Vista easier."
"Coming from personal experience here which is still very fresh and very current for me at 25 years old. I tend to tell no one how I really feel and boast about everything that is good ... when I'm around people I would boast and exaggerate positive things happening around me. Sometimes the exaggeration is so intense, I class it as an upright lie. I have a lot of things but I don't have a house yet, or kids and some 25 year olds do, so I boast myself up to seem better than them because they took a different path to me.  But when I'm alone or not around people I know I'm extremely sad and lonely, even with my accomplishments I cannot escape the fact I'm not happy with myself. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and where my parents or friend say there proud and I honest say I'm a disappointment. I recently told a friend everything, and he said he had no idea. Sometimes pure silence or over positivity can be a mask for insecurity and depression. As this is something I'm coming to realise about myself and take action to change it.   Honestly telling my best friend was the biggest relief I have had in years, anyone else who is feeling this way, it may not seem like it but talking about it is a good start."

"The constant need for attention or reassurance. I can think of so many people or instances that this has applies to. Most recently it's coming from a coworker. I can't stand working with her, she's newer and has less experience yet voices how much better she is at the job. The reality is, I have to constantly pick up her slack. If she says something and I don't acknowledge her and give her the attention she wants or the reaction she wants, it drives her absolutely mad. She also tries to make little jabs at me, yet when I confront her about such things, ""she's joking"". She tries to act like a hard ass until I get annoyed enough to confront her. This might sound mean but given her appearance and stature, it certainly seems like its coming from insecurity."
"I’ve never heard the term suspectrum before, I love it! I wasn’t diagnosed ‘til my early 20s myself."
"Indeed. I always say rudeness and mean-spirited acts are signs of weakness.   When you've got good things going for you and are in command of the situation, you can afford to be kind and courteous and taking the time and energy to be mean doesn't occur to you. If, however, you aren't considerate and polite because you don't regard others highly enough or think about anyone but yourself- that is a sign of weakness of character instead of weakness in position and circumstance. Whereas being courteous despite hardship shows strength of character.  As I got older, I actually don't fear mean, rude or aggressive people at all because they're just showing me that they're weak."
"I think you can establish who they are once or twice, but if you keep just calling them by one of those over and over I think it's insecure.  Especially if the people you're with already know the person. I've had friends and family do that shit."

"I'm so sorry to ask and I understand if you don't want to answer.  How do you support someone who is a pathological liar without directly accusing them of it?  I know someone who I am 99% sure is a pathological liar, but they don't have a diagnosis. They are incredibly insecure about their personality and appearance and will go off the grid for a short period of time (a week or two), and then come back with an incredibly hard-to-question story (the kind of thing where you would look like an asshole for not believing them), but their facts don't add up, or details change when they recount the story again, and it's always a story about them being a victim and having to overcome a great challenge so that you're meant to feel sorry and proud of them. Or, they will relay an event back to you that you were present for, and place themselves as a victim (when they played a very minor part, if any, in the event), and if you softly try to question them, they'll go crazy and argue, using phrases like ""You KNOW I'm right"" and ""You were THERE! You saw it happen how I'm telling it!"".   I like this person when they are being genuine, however, I find it very difficult to support them when I know they're lying to try and initiate a reaction or sympathy from me. I've gently mentioned counselling before (without saying ""I think that you're a pathological liar"", more of an ""I had it and it was really beneficial"" way) and they refuse to entertain the idea, claiming that they struggle sometimes but are perfectly fine.   You wouldn't honestly believe the biggest lie I've been told and had to ""believe"" and I won't post it here in case it identifies the person and they have an account, but I'm really struggling because I don't want to remove this person from my life, but I also can't stand being dragged into offering long term emotional support for something that never happened. They are sometimes a very lonely person and I understand that they behave this way to force people to spend time with them and uplift them into feeling better about themselves, but I find it very difficult to do that for them.   Is it a case of waiting and hoping that they realise it themselves?   I hope that doesn't make me sound insensitive!"

Completely ignoring the part women play, both in large in being dismissive towards men's emotions and on and individual level as toxic members of a relationship, is only making the problem worse. Sorry if you have to take a moment to realize not all women are perfect angels, but that is the truth of the world. They are no different than men - some women *fucking suck*.  Most of the time men stuck in emotionally abusive relationships don't feel shame because the other men around them think they are weak, it's because *the person emotionally abusing them* has set them up to *believe* they are weak, and everyone else will see them as weak, for being upset over their abuse. In heterosexual relationships, *that person is a woman*.  You are labeling negative behavior from *women* as ""toxic masculinity"".   Just *fucking imagine* telling a woman who is upset over her abusive relationship that this is the result of her ""toxic femininity"". Your inbox would implode with accusations of misogyny."

"Overanalyzing is fine as long as you have a good frame of reference. Don't compare yourself only to your ideals, instead compare yourself to the person you were a year ago, your other peers, and other population in general. You'll very soon notice that you're not doing so bad after all. Don't hate yourself for not being the best if you're not even taking a moment to think about how far ahead you are compared to the worst. Most of us sit somewhere in the middle as average people, and a failure to realize that can lead to serious self-confidence issues. On the flip side, once you intrinsically understand that it's very likely anyone else you meet has similar insecurities and self-confidence issues as you, that already puts you way ahead the average person.  That's just my two cents, based on personal experience. Most of the issues with life in general I've experienced myself or my friends have gone through have been purely caused due to low self-esteem, and the only way to fix that is to shift your expectations and accept yourself as you are. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be goals to work towards, but it means treating goals as goals instead of expectations you fail to meet.  If you don't have self-confidence issues, you will soon find out you no longer overanalyze your behaviors. That is really the one thing everyone should look to address in whatever means possible."

"Not the commenter here, but I get what’s being alluded to.  Dissociation comes from childhood trauma often. Dissociation is made up of many symptoms, but one effect of dissociation is avoiding self reflection due to the potential negative emotions which could arise from discovering the reason “why” for certain emotional reactions. (Because the “why” traces back to early painful memories that are not fully integrated in the brain due to the dissociation that occurred back when the events happened.)  This is not the same thing as insecurity, though the two things are interrelated and can often look the same to observers."

I don't like him.  EDIT: A lot of people are saying that they feel like they are this person. Just to clarify, it's not just the fact that he talks a lot and tends to be ranty that annoys me. Some people just have very active brains, and sort of 'runaway thought patterns' if you will, and I get that. It's the fact that he seems offended that anyone would dare steal his conversation spotlight and want to participate that screams insecurity."

"Oof I had a relationship like this in my early 20s. It made my depression even worse. Of course he didn't have any better options to offer, he just wanted to complain about everything."
"I just want to clarify that depression is somewhat in your control. Obviously you can't just decide not to be depressed, but to get better you do have to choose to work at it."
One easy word: Our President. He does a lot of illegal actions and often acts insecure. No I don't hate him it's just what I've learned. He's a funny guy tho no doupt
When someone talks about something they’re going through and you decide that you having something slightly worse is much more important and theirs isn’t   Example based off my own experience:  Jennie: I just lost my 400 day streak with Lucille   Abi: WELL I LOST A 3028 DAY STREAK SO YOU CANT COMPLAIN  Jennie: well this was my first streak and it is important to me because it’s such an achievement for me  Abi: and that was my 568th one so stop whining and come back when you lose a REAL one

Too bad people are just going to keep joking about it because it's easier to think of him as a comedic figure rather than a man who has such absolute power that he can impose a ban like this.  Plus the fact that everyone has forgotten ""Winnie the Pooh"" was a euphemism that anti-CCP activists used to discuss Xi Jinping while avoiding the censors. Banning it was never about personal insecurity, it was about silencing discussion."

Being very insecure
"Especially if you didn't even do the thing. I've seen people interrupt someone talking about their holiday to, say, Thailand for a week with ""my cousin went to thailand for 3 months, and..."" or talking about a new watch with a story about a 3rd friend who has an even better watch."

That was my experience. I thought everyone in high school was doing it but me so I rushed and had sex with a girl I didn’t really like just to get it done and have regretted it ever since. As an adult I’ve learned I was a little earlier than average so I could’ve just waited for someone I really wanted.

"Not being able to accept when you’re wrong.  I have dealt with insecurity a lot so this is something I would do. Even if it was obvious that I was wrong, I would hold my opinion and fight for it just to feel meaningful. In the end it just made me seem more insecure and drove many people away from me"
Is there a term for a woman who willingly puts herself in a subservient position (whether intentional or not) and then tears down other women when they try to exist on an even playing field?
Being mean or rude unnecessarily and then saying it was a joke especially when the person it was targeted to was clearly not taking it that way.

"Compound that with a lack of self-responsibility and self-awareness.  Most folks are raised in an environment where being wrong means being bad.  People love to use other people's mistakes to inflate their own bruised egos too.

"&gt; than the #25 who had a weighted 4.2 and a much better social life and actually had fun and y'all both ended up at the same school anyway.  Coming from someone who was this, trust me, it's way better. My high school grades got me into college...and nothing more. College gets very lonely if you don't know how to branch out of academics, I didn't push too far beyond a small group of friends and some rather nerdy extracurriculars in high school, but it made it possible for me to lead a balanced life during college.  A few of our top performers from high school had breakdowns in college, or just became the wild children they were never allowed to be in high school after they were out from under their parent's supervision. Don't push your academics to unhealthy levels, it's fine to focus on school, it's not fine to be obsessed with it to the point of shutting everything else out."
"Aha it's very possible guys thought I was hitting on them during my school years but I was particularly unattractive during high school specifically - that plus my obliviousness/disinterest may have contributed to it being platonic (at least as far as I could tell)  A lot of women feel like... ""threatened"" by me? It's the best word I can use. Not like I'm intimidating to them, it's just... Like they feel challenged? I'll be completely unaware and just doing my own thing and they'll be silently adding little ""intent labels"" to every action I take.  Actually writing that just made it click a little better.  Essentially, I REFUSE to do anything subtle. Ever. I don't drop hints, I don't beat around the bush, I *always* say what I mean... Idk if they think me doing that is ""wrong"" or they wish that they could be comfortable enough to do that or what, but I think the fact that I won't take part in something that as far as I can tell is quite universal for women is the biggest issue. Like, in any given situation, I will only know your intent based on what you directly verbally tell me."

"The type of girls who have to constantly remind you that they are not like other girls. That they have to remind you that they’re so quirky for eating food and not wearing makeup. That they’re unique for not listening to the popular music of today. And the girls that bring down other girls for liking makeup, or doing their nails and hair, and for liking pop music. Those girls are severely insecure"

Saying this as a guy with a smaller one who’s been belittled for it before, it’s hard to fight my insecurities when everyone I know uses phrases like that because it makes the encouragement I get seem far less genuine.   You can tell me to fuck off for being insecure if you like, but I personally don’t think using those phrases is kind or helpful and I really hate them."

Telling everybody when you're offended. Screaming you're offended is just saying I'm incapable of controlling my emotions so expect you to do it for me.

"My friend’s ex used to brag about his relationship with her like it was the purest form of love. Then we found out he pretty much had her on a leash and locked inside a cage. It goes a little something like this:  Imagine being so insecure of your girlfriend’s commitment to the relationship that you prohibit her from hanging out with any guys, most of which were her close friends she knew way before meeting you.  Imagine after doing that, being so insecure of yourself that you have frequent late night one-on-one “advice sessions” with her female friends to prove you are popular with girls.  Imagine being so insecure of what others may think of you for this that you completely stop your girlfriend from talking about your relationship to her friends and family even when it’s ruining her.  Imagine being so insecure of her leaving you for being such a scum that you tell her “I love you” in the hopes that she doesn’t leave instead of fixing your faults.  And imagine being so insecure after your eventual break up that you make out with her friend mere days afterwards, thinking it will make her jealous...Did I mention she was one of our other friend’s girlfriend?  His excuse for all these dodgy behaviour was “I didn’t want you guys to hate me” or “she made me jealous” and always blamed her for his own faults. People who do hypocritical things and then play the victim card when they’re called out are one of the most insecure scum I’ve ever met in my life."
Me. I do.
When you’re talking to someone and you don’t agree with something they say so they then change their opinion and agrees with yours. I’ve done this sometimes bc i’ll realize “oh wait their point actually makes sense” but when someone does it countless times you’re like ooooh ok dog we get it

Trying to pin down your partner early in the relationship (like saying I love you in the first date or proposing months into) Its cringy
"Wow. That was the most pitiable thing i've read in quite a while.  Pitiable being a key word, here. That's why he still has one remaining safe-haven. YOU know there's a person of worth in there.  Has anyone done anything more extensive than merely calling him out on his shit? You seem to recognize that he's actually a decent guy, but SO ENTIRELY INSECURE that the very hint if the outside world shifts him firmly into protect-mode.  It would be heartening to find that there is some form of renderable help.  (that 'ex-girlfriend's nudes' bit is pretty disturbing, though)  Wow."

Asshole often stems from insecure. Most people who are genuinely secure in themselves don't feel the need to be aggressive toward others except when it's called-for. Being an asshole usually means you feel the need to prove something--to yourself or to onlookers.

He will instead make up increasing stupid and or unlikely excuses until he is literally looking at the ground mumbling responses because he knows that you and everyone else in the room knows how wrong he is but still can't bring himself to just admit it.  I have no real respect for this guy because of it."

"There's a really challenging problem, unfortunately, which is that action begets motivation, not the other way around. When you're already acting, it's easy to keep motivated. It's sort of the psychological version of Newton's First Law -- a person taking action tends to keep taking action. A person at rest tends to stay at rest.  And it's almost cruel, isn't it? Because those of us predisposed to depression will find ourselves in a funk, accomplishing nothing, and failing to ever work up the motivation -- because it's more or less impossible to do so without doing something to first build that motivation.  It's a tough nut to crack. I think just knowing how it works helped me, though. Hopefully it helps others when they start to see it."

“I’m a real man” or stuff like that
IM VERY INSECURE
Lmao exactly
I still do this. I'm working on it.
"Anything that says the person spent way too long looking in the mirror. So excessive make up or overdone eyebrows, hair that only looks good from the front or uncomfortable looking and impractical fashion choices. Guys wearing oversized watches and tiny pants, no socks on but leather shoes etc.    As well, a person who can’t respond normally to a person they’re not used to being around or talking to. If you meet your friends boyfriend/girlfriend for the first time and they just look panicked at you before answering something you’ve asked, it’s probably because they don’t have a big standard response to throw at you that they’re used to giving people."
"It's simultaneously easier and harder than people say, but nothing really prepares you for it (outside of taking care of much younger siblings, I guess)."

People who explicitly tell you how secure they are.
"Being insecure causes both of those things. Cheating, and also fear of your partner cheating.  It sounds like she didn't trust you. She doesn't have to trust other women if she trusts you.  And yeah, you're right, generalizing doesn't help. It doesn't say anything about women, about you, or anyone else but her."
"going to the a roof top and screaming, “I’m very insecure!”"
"Works white collar job and does not do any construction, hunting, or any heavy duty work....but drives a Ford Raptor."
"Don't look them directly in the eyes, focus on a point between their eyes. It's still hard, but easier than focusing on the eyes directly.  At least in my experience."
"When I was a teenager, I did that not to affirm my relationship, but because it made everyone else very slightly uncomfortable, and I thought that was hilarious at the time."
"Yeah... I'll happily talk about depression and anxiety, but I keep my PTSD closer to my chest. It's all part of the same horrible shit I have to deal with, so I don't really think of myself as having 3 separate issues, but PTSD can sometimes be much more loaded and lead to discomfort for everyone when discussed so... I rarely bring it up. My husband knows, and my boss knows... Reddit now, I guess...that's it really. It sounds like this person is not getting the support they need tbh."

Yeah the have to little dick measuring contests to see who is more fucked up and are proud of it. most of them were spoiled through childhood and never worked a day in their life
"When I was pregnant people would always point out that I'm not ""big enough"" and kept telling me i was going to have a small baby which made me insecure.  I ended up giving birth to a 6.9lbs baby girl which I was really proud of, all i wanted was her to not have a low birth weight but as soon as i gave birth ppl just kept asking me what her weight was... which then made me feel like a failure when they'd tell me they're baby girls was 7lbs+   It's really fucked up how people do this, I came out of a domestic violence relationship where the father abused me and his parents hit me and I lost my mind thinking I was going to loose my baby several times. People have no idea how many times I cried about this and how relieved I was when I received my ultrasound and told me my baby was measuring perfect and was healthy. I spent my whole pregnancy crying and hoping for a healthy baby and when people made me insecure about my weight and hers it just made me feel terrible. I'm just happy now about the little things like the fact she was born full term,no low birth weight, no complications, and shes super healthy. I'm very proud that after evrything I gave birth to a perfect human being and no one deserves to make another person feel insecure about literally creating life. The fact that me as a woman can create a life inside me is truly a miracle like I cant stop crying over how perfect my little girl is. Sorry I went on a rant here, I'm 1 month postpartum and I'm still emotional."
"Flashing lights also means turn on your headlights, cop ahead, you can get in front of me, hazard ahead, and other stuff I'm sure I forgot."
"&gt; All those people who post on Facebook those quotes that are like: ‘don’t worry about those who talk behind your back, they’re behind you for a reason’  There's a high school classmate of mine who posts break up quotes constantly and has for *years*, so it's not like she had a recent breakup that was really bad. It's shit like, ""He ripped her heart out, but she was stronger, and she soldiered on. Because she's beautiful, she knows it, and she won't let her pain define her any longer."" I've been through my share of bad breakups so I have a little empathy, but I can't imagine that being my focus for years and years."
"I think they more or less meant the glorification of being mentally ill. Which goes on to what you’re mentioning in your second paragraph.  With glorification means you don’t attempt to get help. You’re cool because you’re mentally ill. But as time goes on, it becomes less and less cool very quickly. And getting help or talking about it in a way that isn’t “I’m cool because of this” but “I need help because of this” is better to do sooner as you’re able to learn early on how to cope with things easier or you’re able to get your medication sorted out sooner, etc etc.  Tumblr is just as bad in a lot of circles as tv, literature, etc. can be. But it has the added competition level to it. “I’m more valid because I have this and this and this and you only have *that*.” Which says you need to be sicker for it to mean anything or for you to have worth.  It’s been a thing for a while, of course. I was very into a certain arty type thing in my teen years and into now and there’s still a heavy push on the mentally ill being more artistic because “suffering is art!” But now, as someone almost thirty who struggles with basic shit because of my mental illness it feels less artistic and more troublesome than anything.  Tumblr is just another breeding ground for these sorts of things. These pockets are everywhere. But a good portion of Tumblr circles are incredibly toxic and damaging to younger audiences and it’s heavily encouraged when it shouldn’t be.  Although! That’s just my assumption. They could have meant anything, really."
No but please give me some sources cause I’m actually more interested in learning about this topic than arguing with him tho lol
I TWO-UP people. So there!
"Yes, he's been speaking in the same meandering, structureless way for decades.  His speech shows no signs of forethought or organization.  You can blame my impression on ""anger and ignorance"" as much as you like, but before I was angry at Trump for his actions, I was amazed that any significant number of Americans could listen to the man speak and think ""yes, here is a man of great ideas who I want to represent and lead our nation"".    Any cursory review of his unscripted public comments show that he has difficulty forming a coherent sentence.  The reports of staffers having to ""dumb down"" his intel briefings to get him to pay attention to them are out there for anyone to see.  I believe there are a few topics he can speak to with some knowledge - I doubt that Wharton straight up handed him a degree for cash - but by and large, I have no reason to believe that the president can read or comprehend much beyond a grade school level."

Just know there are other moms out there (prolly most moms) that feel the same way. The ones that do not say it out loud are the insecure ones.   I totally complain and the only ones that may feel like I don't love my kids, are the ones that don't have kids.   My kids are perfect angels tho... When they are asleep. 😂  You aren't alone!"
"Making jokes about yourself to the point where it gets uncomfortable and making fun of people who've done nothing to you at all.   Also, personally I used to avoid talking to people for more than 5-10 minutes so they wouldn't try to get to know me better and start asking what I do in my free time since I used to game all the time because I didn't have any friends and was too shy to join some hobbies/classes or whatever outside."
"Yeah, when she was bringing up her PTSD in an argument, I really wanted to drop the 'You have no fucking idea what I've been through in my life, but you don't see me using it as a fucking excuse to fuck people over, do you?' line...  But didn't wanna go there, because that's not how adults act.  Plus, once you go down that road with people, it just gets exhausting.    So I just let her have her little pity party, and the only goal from my end was to get her the fuck out of my life.  And i did."

"I worked with a woman like that.  She bragged (constantly) that her kids were potty trained at one. Threw away their diapers on their first birthday.  Anyone who couldn’t potty train their kids at one had something wrong with them.   Turns out she had to constantly race her kids to the bathroom at any sign of needing it.  When she was out with the kids she would carry an inflatable potty and would ask her kids every 20 minutes if they had to go.  That is not potty trained.    Her kids barely graduated high school, btw."
I was in love with this older guy who had had sex with close to 100 women according to him. I shouldn't have taken the bait but I was young and he was hot so I was like damnnnnn. Anyway he did it for like 30 seconds and then cried??? So basically yeah you're right

"I don't think my comments negate my point. Objectively someone who goes out of their way to go ""We're just making fun of people because they denigrate people for not being smart"" is no better than someone who picks on people for not being smart.  It's not a ""Mom he started it!"" Contest.  You're both being twats for the sake of it.  &gt;Weird, I'd think if anyone was in favor of picking on people then it would be the kind of person that drops comments like this:  Now I am curious as to why you're so butthurt about my calling out r/iamverysmart , that you decided to go through my comment history, but it does make me flattered and proves my point, people like you are very insecure and will find whatever excuse you can to make yourself feel better than someone else L.M.A.O.  Also in neither case would I consider that picking on people lol, the first case would be just straight murder, and it was under the context of a dudes entire life getting ruined. The second one is literally saying ""Fuck this specific group of people"" and again the context was women manipulating poor old men into giving them money. But oh yes, keep reaching lmao. If you consider either of these picking on people while you forget you're doing the exact same thing as them, maybe you have more issues than I thought."
"I said I *prefer* men. You yourself are inferring meaning into my words.  There is not a 100% perfect male/female split for *any* personality traits.  My two best friends are female, and my only other female friend is from the same group; my point is that they're my only ones, and that's because I was friends with them in elementary school, before girls started getting really catty with one another. Again, a generalization, not a claim about every single woman on the planet.  I can still have fun in groups that have other girls; however, I'd say that, one-on-one, I have a 90% chance of getting along with any man of any age, and a ~25-35% chance of a woman from the same category."

"Used to have a ""friend"" like this. He would call and talk about nothing but himself for 20 minutes. Never once asked how I was doing, never once let me talk, just went on and on about whatever was happening to him at the moment or what he was thinking.  Got sick of being his personal sounding board and stopped returning his calls.  I don't know if he was insecure, but a narcissist? Oh yeah, big time."
I'm not insecure but have severe anxiety especially in crowds.  I'm curious as to your reasoning behind it :) if that's okay for you to explain.
Yup. I did all of that shit to feel secured.. within 3 yrs of graduating I became a cook and started from scratch again. Saved myself.
"This is the reason I had to stop hanging out at our neighborhood playground. I prefer to drive the kids downtown just so I don't have to engage in mommy group conversations. I was feeling so inadequate when it seemed like every mom had a genius and 'advanced' child and scheduled into every known activity when I just wanted my kids to play and be kids. I got so tired of constantly having to defend and justify my decision to not enroll them into the 'right' school, sign them up for chess at 3 years old and not making them eat non-organic foods all the time."
"This one's very true. I'm insecure as hell and while I don't want to see the worst in others, when someone else makes a mistake my brain immediately goes, ""thank god I'm not the only one fucking stuff up"". Then I feel a bit better about myself."

"I got my masters as well. It's not about being smart in business school, it's about finishing assignments and working well in a group.  There were some really smart people but that's independent of being in the masters program. I test exceedingly well but struggle sometimes with practical applications because I'm a linear thinker.  That being said, I can see in Computer Science for example, how someone could feel dumb because others are just so smart in their field."

"Me also! I blasted through a doctoral program in 23 months, getting my PhD at 25. Never survived the burn-out and my parents never stopped asking whether or not I needed to go to the bathroom and never willingly let me hold their car or home keys. Disgusting. Despite moving to the Bronx alone without a job or a place to live — and making it work — my parents were never convinced that I had awareness of my own bladder and bowel functions or that I could be trusted with a spare set of keys. The problems were solved when they both died. Amazingly, I have been able to navigate without them."

Literally EVERY time. because once she was looking through my phone and saw I was texting a female coworker (about work) and called her 'toots' as a joke. I have never looked through hers. and she wonders why I have a lock on my phone. Also, been together for most of the last 10 years and wonders why I get pissed when she accuses me of cheating. She says 'the fact that you get so mad makes you look suspicious' and 'my friends wouldn't tolerate half of what you've done' ummm I took her in after her ex bf blew his brains out in front of her(while pregnant), have remodeled her home for 'us', am raising the kid she had with said dead ex, and work 60 hours a week so we can have a decent lifestyle. and I got her pregnant, again... I woulda thought the suicide woulda made her think about her emotions a bit more as they were heavily arguing when he pulled the trigger, but it's exactly the same as before, and the phone is only a fraction of the story"

Kicker is, the guy was like 28 years old. Bob marley was long dead before he was even born. He was my boss at the time (I was a kitchen porter) so I couldn't fully call him on it...but I was like ""oh I thought marley died"" and he was like ""yeah, that's what they say...but he faked his death. Loads of celebrities do that when they don't want the fame anymore"" Yeah I don't see that dude anymore. Oh, and he'd also flown an apache helicopter because his dad was a combat pilot in the 80s.

We have people of all different shapes and sizes, and everyone is fucking awesome and supportive of each other. I swear, it is gym heaven for anyone with insecurities.  My partner and I went to a different city and visited a trendy chain gym. I'm a PT, he's a boxer, so we are in pretty good shape and know our way confidently around a gym, so in theory, should not feel conscious at all.   We were in there for 5 minutes before we both freaked out and left because the trendy, attractive dickheads were staring us up and down and making us feel insecure, whispering to each other and what not. We wandered around until we found this little run down muscle gym down a back alley, filled with huge body builders, right across to out of shape people working their arses off. We got a friendly nod from anyone we accidentally made eye contact with, and had a great session.   If someone is looking down on you for being overweight, they're an asshole and you deserve to find a better gym. I'm glad to hear that you don't care about their opinions, because you shouldn't.

You might as well be talking about my next door neighbor but replace motorcycle with a loud ass truck and his loud ass Latin music that he likes to roar down the street after 10pm
i did this all the time with one of my first ever boyfriend's. it was because i was insecure and desperate for validation from him. it didn't help that he was so controlling and undermined me often... hence i felt the need to justify to him that i knew about things that he liked or discussed etc

"There were a bunch of studies done on the intelligence of animals. In one study, blue jays were put in a competitive environment to gauge their reactions.

Interestingly, the birds who learned to steal were also more careful about ensuring other birds didn't watch them hide their food."
"If someone is unable to hear someone else’s stories without comparing it to their own — I find that to usually be a sign of insecurity. For example:  “Did you hear about [someone]? They broke their arm”  “Oh I broke my arm too once. It was like...[proceeds to explain their story without letting other person speak”   This usually happens because they don’t have anyone at home to listen to their stories, making them insecure that no one cares enough to listen to them."

I am a generally anxious person but I've developed the mental fortitude to overcome many of my anxieties, but I've worn the same jacket (3 different jackets over time, only one at a time) every day for several years.   It never occured to me, in fact I've never heard of that being a sign of insecurity, it makes sense - I'm not doubting you - but I don't really understand why. If you could enlighten me that'd be cool, but I also wonder if the notion of the same jacket is connected in any way to wearing 'boring' clothes, or at least not colorful or conspicuous clothes."

She does not believe me anyway and nothing I do is good enough or going to prove otherwise.”"

You're either making an unnecessarily big deal of it for attention and people can't help but stare. Or it's all in your head, nobody actually cares, and maybe that person who was staring was just looking past you.   And this one is actually kind of sad. Because you can't ever call them on it. There's no way to say, ""it's all in your head"". They will remember that *one time* it wasn't and extrapolate that to every experience ever."

"There's a difference between being bluntly honest and going beyond your boundaries.  That's just a social cue that you've just learned.  You can tell your significant other that something doesnt look good/unflattering, but you can't necessarily tell other peoples SO's.

"As soon as I see someone talking about their ""haters"" in a social media post, I've immediately made the following deductions:  1. They are narcissistic. The whole world revolves around them and they genuinely believe that everyone in their lives either absolutely adores them or absolutely abhors them.  2. They have the emotional maturity of a $0.99 loaf of Great Value white bread.  3. Drama is their personal God, and everything they do is centered on amplifying every last drop of sweet, sweet drama in their own lives, and putting it center stage for all to see. If that doesn't garner them the attention they seek, they will instead turn to stirring up strife in the lives of other people.  4. Their capacity to maintain relationships is so hampered by their need for drama that they sabotage their own relationships and as a result only exacerbate their own insecurities.  It's really sad. Especially because in many ways, these issues are likely due in part to poor nurturing growing up. That, or they are just inexhaustible twats."

Someone doesn't know how to do what you do? That is fine and also not their fault. They probably didn't grow up with the same opportunities you did to be in the position you are in now. Show them how or explain how in a positive way so they don't resent the work.   Bob doesn't care that Jan fucked up that cheeseburger. Bob cares more that you think it's okay to complain about Jan for it all day; Bob will tell Jan about it, but it won't even matter because you've already complained about Jan in a way that ensures it will get back to her no matter what, so Bill and Betty and Delilah have already brought it to Jan's attention.

"Yeah, snooping is how I found out my ex had been cheating on me. I was over early one morning, and when he went to brush his teeth (I had woken him up) his phone went off. It was a kik message saying “Good morning baby! &lt;3” My heart sunk. Multiple people had been telling me he was cheating on me with a girl at school. I knew his password was the day we started dating, so I opened it and had scrolled through a week’s worth of messages by the time he came back. The girl from the chats wasn’t even from our state, he met her on CoD!! I really hope his current girlfriend doesn’t have to deal with that, because his excuses sucked. “You know how you have your all-time favorite video game that you play all the time? Then something new and more interesting comes out and you play that for a while, but you always end up going back to the old one?” Guess which “game” I was to him."

Awwww
When your first instinct is to argue every time someone contradicts you. A secure person would want to hear more in case they really are wrong.
"When you can't stay still for a short period of time. For example, when you wait for your coffee.  For example, you change your posture a lot, move your legs, arms in a small way and all that. I still can't get rid of it tbh, cuz I am very paranoid and I feel like sooner or later someone nearby will attack me for some reason, so I subconsciously correct my body to be prepared. The truth is, however, that the probability for it is non-existentially low, but people assuming you are some kind of a weirdo is much higher."
Had an ex who was like this when she was younger.  At some point she had a breakthrough and discovered her love for girl time. It was nice to see her suddenly have a bunch of close girlfriends.
Me. All the time.
Me when a girl talks to me.
People who cheat in rec games/intramural sports.
When people lie about knowing something.  If you're honest you end up learning. The only person effected by your lie is yourself.

"I’ve noticed a lot of moms make up stories about their very little kids saying something so smart, clever or intelligently humorous that you can just tell there’s no way it actually happened, or if it did the mom is changing it a bit for the story. It’s weird to witness."

"My niece was fully potty trained at 15 months. It’s kind of cultural in my country of birth, yet one believed my sister until they offered to babysit her kid and she politely asked to go. Accidents did happen, mostly due to not being near a toilet, but that was so rare it didn’t register."
"That's just your assumption. The question simply was """"What screams I'm very insecure?""""  OP asked, I delivered"
Especially in a culture that seems to encourage and even idolize it.
"Flaunting wealth, especially on social media."
"Those people in facebook who post terrible photos of random people with 'advices' like: ""Girls, if you have a bf and another guy replies faster than him, give the other guy a chance ;-)"""
Don't be afraid to rock the prolly.
"I have a frenemy who constantly brags about how rich she is. She's in my spanish class, and over the past few weeks we did a unit on traveling. She sits next to me in that class, and she was going on and on about how her dad owns a private jet while we were supposed to be studying. The other day she walked into class loudly bragging about how her new earrings were solid gold (they were literally bright pink, not gold at all). So yeah. I guess I kinda saw her as a liar and nothing more, but now I realize it might be because she's just insecure."
"r/teenagers pretty much   A lot of them are lame kids who like to go on about the “popular girls” or “quirky girls”   It’s to the point where it becomes clear that they’re very sexually frustrated teenagers that don’t really talk to a lot of actual females as much as they just judge them from the back of the class because that’s what they think the popular girls do to them.   To be fair tho, that is what most of high school is anyways. There are definitely “popular girls” who are very judgement just as there are lame kids who do the same.    It’s just a bunch of kids who are too blinded by their own insecurities to see how alike they really are and how well they could know each other. They retaliate and create this battle in their heads where judgement and hate are the artillery.   When I was in 7th grade. There was this girl who could be seen as one of those stereotypical judgmental popular white girls. Instead of being offended by the awful and mean glances she’d give me, I made an effort to get to know her. And of course she was actually really sweet and insecure in her own ways just like me.   Can someone please tl;dr this because I’m kinda tired of writing this and I can’t think of one right now."
"Ask other parents about how whatever they're talking about is going and struggles they had. Compare the stories, not the accomplishments."
"People who never ask you how you are doing in school, work, family, vacations, just life in general. Selfish and insecure usually come hand in hand. They only want to talk about themselves and never want to make the conversation about others."
Being derogatory or abusive to someone incapable of defending themselves. A good example would be a narcissistic father browbeating a child for seemingly harmless things.  Not that I would know anything about that. &gt;_&gt;

"Me, internally"
"I like to keep a good 2-3 car length distance between myself and the car in front of me on the highway. Especially in the passing lane because that’s where the more sporadic drivers are. Yesterday I had a guy, in a lifted truck of course, pass from directly behind me to directly in front of me then throw a beer can out his window at me... like fuck me for keeping a safe following distance right."
"I grew up a tomboy, and in many ways I still am, but when I was growing up I didn't get along with other girls because nothing they did or said made any sense to me. I viewed them like an anthropologist views an undiscovered tribe. ""Observation notes 10/12/2003: Subjects appear to coat their lips with the blood of their enemies to signal sexual maturity.""  Add that to a child/teenager's inability to empathize, and my particular brand of being both outgoing *and* socially awkward, and you had some truly horrific misunderstandings. I just learned it was best to avoid them altogether. It wasn't until my late twenties that I have become comfortable interacting with adult humans of the feminine bent. (Because let's be clear, its *femininity* rather than females that I had a hard time understanding.)"
**A Rolex.**
"Academia is such a toxic breeding ground. Grad school was just a constant feeling of imposter syndrome for me and many of the people in my cohort. There was lots of in-fighting, cliques, and jealousy. Who was getting published and who wasn’t. All the grad students were stressed about teaching loads and their own work. At the same time you have full profs who don’t give a single fuck about anything other than their own work, and jaded NTT profs that get paid barely anything. Throw in natural human tendencies to have bad traits and it’s even worse.   But— not everyone is like that, and the seminars where you get to sit with likeminded people, and a nurturing, expert professor, and spend 3 hours talking about your passion are the absolute best feeling.  Still, the hoops you have to jump through in grad school are the reasons I stopped after my MA."

"This is such a mom comment, but I find with my own toddler we have tons to talk about. But that's because I know her and am comfortable with her. It's much harder with other people's. I also love spending time with her as she's fun, energetic and hyper aware of the world around her. She's an absolute blast. Now don't talk to me about the newborn stage though...."

"Using the words ""alpha"" and ""beta"" to describe people.   So, true story: there was a guy I knew on a friend of a friend basis several years ago who was basically the kind of guy you'd see being made fun of on r/iamverybadass. Any time he was driving through a poor neighborhood he'd talk about the gun he kept in his glove compartment, and occasionally went on a rant about how he would throw pebbles at male bicyclists out of his car window and try to knock them off of their bikes, because, in his view, *real men* drove cars. If he was in the vicinity of anything or anyone remotely artsy or alternative he would go on a rant about how they were going to turn him gay.   Unsurprisingly, he would always introduce himself as an ""alpha male"" and call other men, including his roommate, ""weak little beta males"". Very weird and creepy guy, and one of the few people I've ever completely cut off contact with."
"Seizing an opportunity, like the one presented by this question, to critically examine **other people’s** faults and weaknesses and frame your response as though *other people’s* faults and weakness are simply theoretical to you is a huge sign of insecurity.  People who choose to answer out of their own lives, putting their personal truth out there whether they *feel* secure or not, are doing really well."
"Over thinking the pros and cons of every situation. Very insecure myself, so there's that..."
"I'm at work but when I'm home I hope to remember. You can find drag races of lambos losing to little electric cars from the 90s-2000s. My father was always a gearhead and I remember saying that an electric car was dumb, then he showed me a video of a 1/4 mile drag where a lambk couldn't win.  Should be said that the lambo wins in a longer straight stretch due to a higher top end BUT of there are many corners with rapid acceleration out of them the electric  car will 9/10 times win because of the instant torque"
"Constantly saying ""lmao"""
"I often see it is the opposite, interpreting someone sharing a similar or relatable experience as trying to ""one-up"" you is a sign of being insecure."

"I had one girlfriend that kept asking me if I was talking to other girls, cheating, etc. Turned out not only was she on several dating apps AND the fucking Craigslist hookup section thing, she was cheating on her husband with me."
talking about yourself and not letting the other talk. Or having one sided convos.
“Comparison is the killer of joy.”
"I can confirm this. I was raised under the ideals of always trying to improve yourself and always doing your best for your own sake. Because of this I never got angry when someone was better than me at something. My aunts, uncles, and grandparents on all sides though have a very competitive outlook on life. As a result they always seem angry and upset when they lose. Even over stupid things they have no control over, like they're favorite sports team doing poorly. I literally had a cousin call and tell me he wasn't going to a theme park with me the next day because his team had lost a crucial game and he was depressed. Just a fucking ridiculous way to live honestly."
It's important to recognize your own insecurities. It points out something you may not even realize you do. I actually found it helpful
"Two examples:  One - There’s this dude that goes to my school who always wears the same tank top with a hood on it, and he’s always doing crap like doing pull ups on high surfaces, doing backflips, etc.  Two - Those disgusting 14 year old girls on Snapchat that say “I’m sad don’t hmu”, or post pictures of their boyfriend 24/7. You probably know like 30 people who match this exact description."
"I agree because you used the word ""forcing"" and not offering. There is nothing wrong with offering. Some people won't accept when someone says ""no, thanks"" though. That's when it becomes a problem."
I know a girl that brags about how much she and her bf have sex. It’s pretty cringy

I like posting things I like on my page. I’m in love with my girlfriend so she’s gonna be my topic of thought often. People who make my post on my page about the girl I love into a situation about them are insecure.

I'm typically a nice guy to everyone regardless of how douchy they are. I just find life is easier to be nice to people. I have a co-worker who said he wanted make me cry and get me upset solely because I'm nice. He said he would trash talk things I love be excessively mean and nasty about me and when I said all that really doesn't matter and wouldn't work (because I value his opinion at 0) he said he could kick me in the balls to make me cry. The guy is the biggest a-hole I've met in a long while and after reading this thread it just shows how insecure he is.
Jealousy.

"I remember reading about a psychological theory about people's motivation. I can't remember where I read it, but it goes something like this. All of us have some kind of insecurity, and that insecurity leads us to behave in a certain way. For example, if I feel insecure about my finances, I would either use that as an excuse to blame others or hustle until I can be part of the FIRE movement.   In relation to this post, there's the perspective that everything people do is because they are insecure. There's no such thing as a secured person."

"*No one* actually *believes* you have a small dick for driving a lifted truck. People who say this tend to be overly concerned with money and have misdirected values, they are materialistic and see higher worth on what they posses rather than who they are as a person. It's why they hate on people who have ""bigger, better and more"" things than they do, it makes them insecure and unhappy about their current situation in life and they have the need to put people  down to make themselves feel more fulfilled. Making fun of dude's dick is just the most convenient way to do that."

"My SIL. Loves to declare how she's ""opinionated"" while tearing up my parenting decisions, etc., in front of her inlaws.  She's not opinionated, she's extremely insecure. It's painfully obvious.

After some self evaluation and almost dying, I stopped that behavior entirely. Hook ups just make me feel like shit in the end anyway"
"I knew a couple that had king/queen matching tattoos. They had been together/not together/then together again so many times in their lives starting from high school to now in their 40s it was hard to keep track of. There was a lot of unprompted how great their relationship was and how even if they left they'd always end up together.   Yeah, bonus was they were swingers/meddling in open relationship stuff and they were NOT through enough of their shit for that."
I don’t get why posting uplifting quotes is bad? Seems like they saw a quote that helped them feel better or realized it themselves and want to share. Better than having everything on social media be superficial.

"Constantly talking about yourself or having the need to contribute to every single conversation screams insecure to me.  You should be as comfortable being silent as you are when you're talking.  You should be willing to listen and learn. Someone who talks a lot comes off as more unsure and insecure, just trying to match up to everyone else in the room. They also try to one-up people no matter what the conversation is about. This is of course very subjective and will require a lot of observing a person's behavior over time."

"You don’t believe that people with low self-esteem insult others they may be jealous of? I’m not sure if you if you have ever had low self-esteem, but it doesn’t seem like it wouldn’t make sense.  It is studied that people with low self-esteem are more judgmental. Low self esteem is also related to comparisons. So if you feel less than someone else, finding a fault within them is a coping mechanism. And if you’re an asshole, you may verbalize that.  While it’s not everyone, surely you can believe things like that can happen."

"I used to do this so much when I was a teenager. I lied about what movies I'd seen, books I'd read, music I liked, anything to seem more like the person I was with so that they'd like me. I'd research the stuff so I could talk about it but I basically would fashion myself a new personality to be just like the other person. I ended up actually liking some of the stuff but the charade went on so long that I'm still unpacking how much is me and how much was a lie, and I'm well into my twenties now. I still have to stop and think when I encounter something new - do I really like this or do I feel like I should like it? It's almost impossible to unravel when you're so insecure that your whole personality is mirroring.  My husband is still learning about it too. I was 100% someone else when I met him and still so engrained in the habit that he often equates things he likes with things I also like, automatically. It's weird for both of us whenever I discover something radically different about myself."

Thought this was r/jokes for a sec
He doin his best man
"In college I had a friend who seemed to believe that everyone in our friend group was just pretending to like him or just tolerating him. He seemed to believe this because occasionally he would pick up on subtle signs of irritation towards him. What he didn’t understand is that even if you are good friends with everyone in a group, that doesn’t mean that no one in the group will find you annoying from time to time.   Just for him, one day I pulled him aside and got out a pen and paper. I created what I called the tilt web. I wrote everyone in this friend group’s name on the paper forming a circle of names. Then I proceeded to draw arrows between names. I said each arrow represents that the person who the arrow is pointing to is sometimes slightly annoyed by the person the arrow is drawn from. All 10 people on the group except one had at least 1 arrow to and at least one arrow from them.   The problem with this kind of insecurity is that they won’t believe someone if they are simply told that they are fine. They understand that if someone doesn’t really care about them it’s still a lot easier to tell them that they are fine, even if they aren’t. Now that we have both graduated he mentioned that he hasn’t forgotten me drawing that web and that it was a lot more meaningful to him than me just telling him that he is fine."

"I'll be honest. Having been cheated on a couple times in the past, this insecurity is a little hard to overcome. And ideally, you have the self awareness to resist letting the insecurity get the best of you, but it doesn't always work out that way in new relationships. It helps when you have a supportive partner that won't take it personally, and if you are sane enough to not cross any clearly established boundaries. Lol. But I remember the first time I got caught looking through his phone, and I was so ashamed and embarrassed that I started crying, and he said ""Hey. I get that I might have to pay for the crimes of your exes. And you are worth that to me. But I don't think we'll ever be genuinely happy together until you can trust me. So let's work on that.""   Idk. I'm lucky. And it's something that we are definitely still working on. Being cheated on like I have in the past was incredibly painful and the desire to get in front of it before it happens again is very real and very powerful. But it does feel like it's going away. Little by little.   Some people let this insecurity get the best of them and aren't in a place in their lives to have a healthy relationship. But as valid as your anger is towards their violations, it's not personal, and sometimes it's not really even their fault, and if they are worth it to you, (and they may not be, it's fine to want to be with someone that knows how to handle their baggage better) you can get through it."

"I personally think face filters, such as the ones on snapchat, show insecurity. I mostly picked this up because of how its used and what they do. The Face filters often smoothen out your face(removes skin inconsistencies such as pimples, dark spots, etc) and in a way sets a standard saying “hey this is what perfect face looks like”, which is frankly not true. I don’t know much about this topic and Im not gonna talk about it like I am a expert on it, these are just based on my observations."
"Joining a cult or MLM company..  Cults, Scam companies, and mlm companies prey on vulnerable people who are insecure for whatever reason, and convince them that joining will improve their lives. It's so sad because a lot of people who are insecure are usually that way for a reason and it breaks my heart that people would take advantage of that. The worst is how they take someone's tragic traumas and twist them into a reason for joining a cult."

I agree. I used to lie a lot when I was younger. Certainly was an issue of insecurity. Now I do not lie because I am so afraid of falling again. I also feel like shit the times I do.
"My ex boyfriend would lie constantly. He lied about being registered to vote to put me down about not being registered to vote. He lied about his credit score when he found out I had a bad credit score (he said his credit score was 680 and was very smug about it, as I was crying about my credit score. turns out it was in the 400's and he got his mom to cosign on his apartment.) He lied about knowing how to fix computers. He lied about being able to speak Spanish. (This one was very embarrassing because people would speak to him in spanish and he would pretend to understand and he would say something back that was barely elementary Spanish.) He lied about how much he made so he could prove he made more than me. I would find his pay stubs and he made barely 300$ a paycheck. Everything seemed to be a lie to make himself seem better than me. It was exhausting. He was very insecure."

"Putting all the blame on others. I’ve known a few people to do this and it’s like whenever something bad happens, it’s ALWAYS someone else’s fault.

Most religious people do not do this, but there are some who think that they are 100% right in their beliefs and therefor can do no wrong because their religion says so or whatever. They scorn others for doing ‘bad’ things, but then turn around and do the same things themselves, but oh it’s ok because they’re religious."

"I will say this, I’m pretty insecure and I don’t talk about myself all the time because I’m afraid of other people’s opinions CONSISTENTLY. Always afraid I’m not good enough or people won’t like me. Even though I’ve been told I’m a likable person, and that I’m pretty and smart, I still second guess everything &amp; think people say nice things because they have ulterior motives, which most of the time isn’t the case."
This isn't necessarily insecurity. It could just be the way things are done within some religious groups. Some typically believe you shouldn't be alone with someone of the opposite gender that isn't a spouse or blood relative. It takes away temptation and the threat of false accusation. I grew up in a church that the pastor had taught that. I'd been away from it for a long time when I was helping some friends move and we were going from one house to the other and my friend who is married said she would ride with me over to the other house. At first I was somewhat uneasy about it and I realized how stupid that was. People with that mindset don't seem to think either side has an ounce of restraint and the only thing that's keeping people from knocking boots at any moment is another person in the room.
"Hell yeah, I want to improve myself"
"This kind of stuff always gets to me. I work with kids a lot at my job and I’m pretty well versed with child development so I deal with insecure moms a lot.

Insulting other people
"Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram bragging.  The need to show off to the world... it’s screams insecurity."
Judging others to no end and being overly critical of others can often denote that they are over critical and negative towards themselves as well
"A jacked-up F-250 pick up with dulies, truck nuts, and truck exhaust pipes. Bonus points for rolling coal."
"he said people with low self esteem ""will think..."" and people with high self esteem ""will not feel...."".  You've got no guarantees about any of that, you're assuming something about someone based on nothing more than your own speculation. My entire point was that they've not even demonstrated that a majority behave that way, and neither have you.  I can easily reason that people with low self esteem are less likely to attack or judge others, because they bleieve themselves to be worthless and therefore unworthy of passing judgement. Perfectly reasonable conclusion, but no basis on which to say everyone with low self esteem is like this."
Thank-you :)

This is what I think too but people that participate seem to convince themselves it’s healthy. “I have nothing to hide so why not?” Because everyone deserves privacy. It’s a basic human right.  I know a married couple and I feel like my husband is blind to how weird it is that the wife knows the passwords to all his stuff and just picks up his phone and uses it but always has to go out of her way to call attention to the fact that she knows the password. Like displaying her mild power or whatever.

He’d always argue and make fun of me over stupid things like my phone, my clothes (we wore uniforms), my haircut/beard, my car, etc. Worst part is he was one of my managers."

"Tbf, the milestones aren't bullshit. Early intervention (like PT, or OT for feeding issues, ST for speech issues, etc) is a wonderful thing and it comes from the idea that most kids should be able to do X in roughly Y timeframe. The bullshit lies in the needless bragging when your kid achieves Milestone Whatever at 11 months when it's typically 12-18 months. Or straight up lying about having hit a milestone that's not even remotely age-appropriate (like the 1 year that can speak in full sentences on Facebook crap). They are medical and developmental tools. It's sad they've become some kind of barometer for success as a parent.  Also, Jesus, what community were you connected to that made it seem like potty-training should be accomplished at 18 months? Ridiculous!"

That reddit post on the front page rn of some guy suing Chris Brown for using his picture on an instagram post as if anyone actually is paying attention to it
"&gt; I have a 7 week old baby and I've already realised that only I give a shit when my baby acheives something and I will now happily keep that to myself.    Your family and (I bet) most of your friends will genuinely be interested in hearing about the achievements of your child from time to time.    Sure it can get tiresome if that's all they ever hear about when you talk/message or if it is always done pushing how they're only X months old but can already do Y, but honestly don't feel like other people don't give a shit (particularly if it's influenced by the generally horrifically cynical attitude that exists on Reddit) - they overwhelmingly do.   As for the latter bit, again you shouldn't feel you have to shy away from talking about where your baby is at because it might make others worry. It's great to be conscious that other people might be worried about progress (as you may go on to be too, it's entirely normal to!) but we can all help address that by talking with friends/family not just about the achievements of our children, but about the things we maybe worry they haven't achieved yet too. Suddenly the fact little Jimmy can't walk by 1 and a half feels less stressful when you know 5 people who are in the same boat or who've been through it the same when their kids were that age."

You never leave them.  I've been shit on, puked on, pissed on, spit on - pick a bodily fluid and at least one patient has gotten it on my uniform. Not once have I even thought about bailing on my partner in the middle of a call.   Getting cock slapped by a dismembered member would just make for a good story when I got back to the office."

I feel you friend. There’s something about eye contact and conversing where if I’m saying something I’ll worry “shoot do they think I’m lying? Wait what if I AM lying?” And then obsess over the “criteria” that meets the situation. Example:  I love cookies. But wait do I like cookies more than other people? I don’t eat them that often so can I really say I love them? A silly little example but my ability to rationalize needs a little help.

As a young man, I started to realize that I was sometimes putting other people off because they interpreted my attempt to share with them as ""oneupmanship."" I eventually learned to not share as much."

"It’s interesting that you’ve brought this up. I’ve been in a relationship where infidelity was a problem, and one of the biggest reasons I almost kicked it to the curb was precisely because I didn’t wanted to do something like this. My partner has even offered to let me access their phone whenever I want to, but is that really a relationship? I’m pretty sure I have insecurities like just about everyone else, but tech stalking my partner-even in the wake of a cheating event-isn’t something I’m willing to waste physical and emotional time and effort on.  I’m guessing that people who do this kind of thing are highly insecure about their own value in a relationship, and insecure about potentially being alone if they walk away. I could be wrong, but that’s how I see it having dealt with these considerations myself."

And then she waited for the ppl to say: nooo, u so pretty gurl!  She was pretty, don't get me wrong, but I was annoyed of her compliment fishing. One day someone commented: yes. True. Looks shit. Or something like this. She was furious and she was spamming me on my messenger, if she really looked shit-  I think deep in her heart she was really, REALLY insecure.  Kind of sad, tho."

"Have you heard of the concept of the ""good-enough mother""? Basically, the idea is that mothers (or parents generally) who never let their kids down tend to produce children unable to deal with failure, disappointment, and other hardships in life, whereas parents who generally take care of their kids needs, but don't do everything for them are more likely to produce independent, well-adjusted children."

"It goes deeper though. It's when you start doing things you don't enjoy or agreeing with people's comments you don't believe in.  It's being too sympathetic an ear. It's when Bob tells you Betty is a bitch, and you agree, then betty tells you Bob is an asshole and you agree. The next day they both ask you to eat with them at work. Who do you pick?  The doormat would find an excuse to eat alone so as to not offend either and to keep up appearances that he both likes and hates both of them depending on who hes hanging out with.   People pick up on that and they will stop liking and respecting you for having no backbone.   If you have no ""enemies"" you've never stood for anything.  The insecurity is not willing to rock the boat with your own choices and eventually that coping technique leads to being a blank boring slate. You convince yourself you have no strong opinions to avoid any possible conflict."

"I'm not sure if women ""wish they could be comfortable enough to do that"" or see it as ""wrong"".. I think it has to do with being used to all these subtle rules, being raised like that and you refusing to play by those rules is like going to another country and not adhering to the customs, traditions and language of that country.   I think that's why women maybe get intimidated or confused because they're not sure of you're ignoring the ""rules"" or not aware or if you just don't like them when you're not using the ""agreed upon"" customs they're used to adhering to."

"**An outwardly harmless version of insecurity:**  When people are skittish, apologetic, and shrink from situations and people, continually procrastinating on their own empowerment. Confusing sacrificial meekness with courtesy. Basically, chronic self-doubt-induced submissiveness.  **An outwardly harmful version of insecurity:**  When people put on a fake persona that appears as if they've superficially copycatted other ""successful"" or ""powerful"" people but lack the thoughtfulness and courage to develop themselves genuinely and deeply. Especially toxic when this is coupled with pushing/keeping others beneath them. Basically, ladder-climbing pretentiousness and fakery."

It's like digging for compliments but in reverse, and I've only recently come to the realization that I do this as a way of seeking reassurance and validation.  Examples: ""I didn't have time to do my hair or anything today so I look like shit haha"" (hoping for ""nah it looks fine"" or ""I didn't notice, you look great"")  ""I totally didn't mean to do that weird thing yesterday, I feel bad about it"" (hoping for ""it's cool!"" or even ""I didn't even notice, so it wasn't weird"")  I've been doing this for years and only realized when my current best friend just absolutely doesn't reassure or validate.... which is exactly what I needed in my life right now tbh."
"Screaming ""I am insecure"""
Its probably more like 52%. There are more women than men for a few reasons;  Women live about 5 years longer than men and men tend to engage in more risky (dangerous) behavior. Result is young men tend to kill themselves doing stupid stunts. Men also tend to succumb to things like heart attacks at a younger age than women. So that skews the gender balance a little bit.
Actively seeking out signs to find the insecurities in other people seems pretty insecure to me.

I am in a relationship now where I’m not jealous at all. My boyfriend talks to waitresses, random people if we’re out but it’s all in good conversation. It’s normal for people to want to socialize, it keeps their minds entertained &amp; stimulates them. As long as there’s no disrespect then there’s no issue."

"Could be, but some people also have experiences from bad relationships that they don't know how to cope with certain things. Being open about stuff like this helps because not everybody wants to stay insecure.  Unless the relationship is very unhealthy this are the exact things you can work on to become a better couple. Say a girl had one or more exes that often cheated on her, this would make her hard to trust people. And its not really her fault now is it. Same thing with being around addicts (which could even be the parents).  In many cases it could be that crazy girlfriend but its also pretty ignorant to automatically assume it to be one.  Lastly I also think its not necessary to lock away your phone like that. Why do you need to hide stuff from your SO? You should be open and honest about everything. Its not like you can't have friends or a social life. New relationships are weird and uncomfortable. Stop making things worse. Insecurity like that is often when somebody came from one or more bad relationships and need help adjusting. In other cases its because they feel they don't deserve you or got the sense that they are not sharing enough. Many reasons that aren't just ""crazy""."

So on the plus side I never has to buy my exwife jewerly because she associated it with cheating.  I went to work in an office when I was 31, the office was full of young (18-25 year old) women, all of them very attractive and in shape while she was over weight.  She hated going to my place of work.  And when I had to work overtime she accused me of cheating on her with one of those coworkers.

We still know that female-female relationships are important and we don’t hate other women, we’re just choosy about the other women we become friends with and more than likely our other girlfriends have the same philosophy. We also don’t think men are better than women in any way shape or form. We’re *usually* (not trying to generalize) are just a bit more laidback and not so high-maintenance.  The former women.....

"I worked with a insecure,  ""woman"" who never shut up about her kids, husband's health, or financial situation. Everything she did was better than what you did. Told everyone under the sun her priblems, looking for validation and sympathy. She had to one up you in any way shape or form.   Named my cat ""x"", she named hers ""xsquared"". This was within earshot of a high government offical. She would talk on the phone loudly to her kids to seem powerful. The mother of the year. She was eating herself to death due to stress. Her kids were complete brats in her opinion. They were out of control with the husband's illness. She never shut up her home life. She never did any work. Just zoned out at work, tormenting us.    I nearly had a nervous breakdown cos she couldnt shut up. I hated going to work.  Her immediate coworkers wore earplugs in front of her. No one couldnt do much. Cos of union ties. Her supervisor couldnt do anything. She was a wreck and wasnt self aware. It was mentally draining. She screamed silent insecurity and mental anguish. She couldnt deal. I had been in her shoes once, but found my grounding. I left the ministry for another just as my father passed. Timing sucked all around for me.   I came back to clear out my desk, she wasnt there. Which was nice since I needed quiet to grieve and transition on so many things. Her coworkers agreed it was a good thing, cos i would have decked her after her better funeral storytime. Everyone knew I wanted to tell her to STFU, but you know professional boundaries. They told me a few months later. I understood she was in over her head, but you can't help what doesnt want to be helped. Her husband passed recently. Haven't asked for an update, don't want to know.    Not sure if this is the right place, but she was the ultimate one upper."

"As the other person stated, you can phrase things in a way, that doesn't hurt people - That said, it's an art.  Generally, it comes down to, how close you are to people. Telling someone you just met, that their outfit is shit, is not very nice and a extreme example of what not to do.  Just get to know people and learn what you can address and what you can't. I, for example, don't really mind criticism of my behaviour. I know, that I can be pretty blunt about my opinions, so I will accept when someone (Doesn't have to be someone familiar) tells me to take it back a notch. I actually appreciate it, because it isn't my intention to hurt someone. I'm just taking myself a bit too serious sometimes and tend to get emotional, because I usually try to take my time, to form a meaningful opinion.  That said, I don't like it, when people I just met, comment on how I look. My stepfather shamed me a lot for being fat, so I became insecure about it. I am relatively fit now, so it's not that big of a deal now, but it's still something I do not appreciate.  To give you an example, a friend of my parents, who I see every couple of years, just randomly said ""You are so thin now"", when we met again. I just answered: ""Thank you! You gained weight, right?""  Understandably, he was appalled. That said, someone with a bit more social intelligence would have probably understood my reaction, as what it was: I am just someone who doesn't appreciate these kinds of comments and (at that time) was insecure about it.  That's part of what it means, to get to know someone. As long as you can transport, that it's not your intention to be mean about it, people will forget about inappropriate comments, you make. And at some point, you will know the strengths and insecurities of your friends and know, what you can say and what is a topic you shouldn't address.  A good rule of thumb is, stay away from politics and religion, with people you just met, but seems to be easier with people that are younger (Perhaps, because they have more similar opinions). Commenting on appearance, used to be acceptable, but is getting less and less, at least in my social cycle.  If you feel like this is genuinely inhabiting your ability to communicate your thoughts and feelings, you might want to talk to a psychologist. But that's not my call to make, I can just say, it did help me (But I obviously was/am on the other side of the extreme)."

Same here. I'll even lie about dumb shit and I've just gotten into such a mental state of wanting validation that I'll lie to a person differently just to be liked or escape getting in trouble. It's become a point in my life where I don't realize I'm doing it sometimes. I know it's wrong but I'm genuinely honest to a few people I know. I'm trying to be more aware of my words and be honest but it's difficult with my family because they seem to only care if what I say makes me or more importantly them look good so I've learned to just say the most appealing things to people when I'm around them.

"A girl I went to school with was talking to me about her boyfriend, and how that weekend he was going to a party with his friends. She said something like ""And he better not be going there to hook up with a bunch of girls."" I think she was expecting me to just laugh and brush it off but I questioned it. ""You think he's going to cheat on you? So you think he's the type to be unfaithful? Why would you he with someone you think is going to cheat on you? Why stick with someone untrustworthy?"" That kind of stuff. She kind of like got sheepish like ""No, I don't think he would, I'm not serious.."" but I think she was lying a bit and was being serious, just didn't want to actually think about it. I don't know why people seem to think being in constant defense mode against your partner cheating is normal. If they love you and respect you, anyone could flirt with them and it wouldn't matter, they'd love you, still be faithful. Your partner is not an object to protect, or a misbehaving pet that you have to stop from running away."

There's a girl at work who has one of these n it's widely known she's been banging around...sometimes get drunk texts from her.  They should really just break up already

"Sounds cheesy but I really think positive affirmations are helpful.  Like if you focus on something you do well and just tell yourself “fuck yea, I’m awesome at that!” Keep patting yourself on the back about the good stuff, even if it makes you feel weird, and eventually it will become a habit and outweigh the negative thoughts."
i feel like a bit of the one upping shit comes from people trying to relate but failing hard and coming off as a dick or they just suck at social skills

"&gt;  But below a certain age, you're not really building a relationship with them, you're just wrangling them.  This is going to come off condescending, but thats certainly not my intention. I’d really like to encourage you to reframe your thinking on this. It’s these thoughts that make people undervalue and ultimately abuse children.   Think about how you would feel if you woke up one day in a hospital in a foreign country with no memories and no understanding of the language. How would you feel if people come in and out of your room and start giving you commands, getting progressively more frustrated, then grabbing your body to clean you, move you, and feed you. I don’t know a single adult that would be cool with it, but seem to laugh when people do it to children. Believe it or not, children are much more capable at comprehending things then people give them credit for, and they are able to remain calm as long as we are. If we view our role with children as a guide instead of needing to police bad behavior they are much more amicable.  Edit: is believing children deserve empathy and understanding really that offensive to people? Anyone downvoting care to share a different perspective?"
"Commenting on other's physical problems when you have the same problem or a problem that stems from the issue.   For example a balding guy pointing out other people's hair loss or attempts to cover up their hair loss. ""Oogabooga that guy has a toupee and it looks sooo baaaad"""

"Demanding money from other people and calling it justice instead of swallowing two hard facts:  1) you made poor decisions in life. Not everything was your fault, but you could've done much better rif you tried harder. Those who honestly couldn't do anything are very few in number and you're likely not one of the innocently helpless people.  2) redistribution policies will never be enough if the concern is growing the economic pie rather than giving razor thin slices of the pre existing pie to everyone.  Just get over yourself and learn a skill that's in demand. It's a hard thing to do, but you'll be rewarded in the end with a better living standard. Heaven forbid you stop victimizing yourself."

"Actually theres a huge difference between being insecure and just fishing for compliments,an insecure,low self-esteem person doesnt bring others down just so they could get compliments.An insecure person thinks that everyone else is better than him or her."
"I’m not offended, and I definitely know couples who post everything they do together but one is a serial cheater. I pretty much only work and spend time with my girl so these people do cast a bad light on genuine happiness because there are so many more people pretending to be rather than working on the issues they hide, why I’m kinda hot on this take. She makes me feel like a King when I am with her, on top of the world, so I call her my Queen. I think it is cute."

"Literally just like that.  A friend of a friend always did this in group chat. Nobody would ask, but out of nowhere he'd regale us with how great his last lay was, boast about how many women he's has sex with, or offer to dick down the women in the chat. Basically an awful IRL version of Barney Stinson or Tucker Max.  Apparently I was the only one who had a problem with this, so I left that group. But those guys are really out there doing that."

"Everybody lies! A lot. Noone truly likes who they are because at our core we are all selfish, self serving , despicable bastards.  Humanity is a plague and we all deal with that knowledge the best way we can.  We invent religions, pathos, mental illnesses, and a myriad of other excuses or controls in a vain effort to explain our pointless existences.   We are all insecure, but some of us are less annoying about it than others.  Treat your fellow man with decency and kindness and stop being so fucking critical of every goddamn thing you see or hear and there will be far less insecurity in the world.  Or don't because your lives are meaningless nothing you do matters or will persist in any meaningful way, and in the grand scheme of things in far less than 100 years no one will remember anything about you.  If they do, it will be only the horrible things you did and none of the good.  So don't worry meat machines one day your batteries will run out, your OS will glitch, your parts will wear and malfunction, or some moron will be directly responsible for you being taken offline.

That friend of his feeds his ego and licks his ass clean, he says what he wants to hear... This has been going on for months already, I've accepted the loss of friendship long ago. We are on different wavelengths at this point in life. I probably sound like a bad friend but I'm tired of dealing with the shade all because he feels some type of way, there's no excuse to be such an ass to the people that have been there for you on your lowest and highest.

"For liberal tears, duh.   For people like this, 70% of the things they do are just to piss off other people so everyone can be as miserable as they are. The other 30% is because they’re a bunch of toddlers who can’t handle being told not to do something, so they’re going to do it 10x as hard just to show everyone else how manly and cool they are. I’m sure we’ll all agree that they are genetically superior as we choke to death on our unlivable planet in a few decades."
Making these threads to find out if you're insecure
This is something I always have to explain to people. Just because you're being honest doesn't mean you're not a dick. There is such a thing as tact.   There's a huge difference between:  Oh that dress makes you look pregnant and fat  And  Oh that dress isn't very flattering. I think another might better compliment you.
"Hitting milestones ahead of time isn't a direct indicator of your child being smart. The only reason pediatricians pay attention to the milestones is to try to recognize signs of abnormal development. It's most deffinitely not a race.   In fact, if a child hits certain milestones *too far* ahead of time, it might even be early signs of autism. (But don't suggest this to any moms, they'll instantly hate you for suggesting their child might be autistic)"
Lotta guys have a lotta sex in highschool. Not sure why that's unbelievable.

Maybe they want a closed triad relationship instead?
"I used to be this way all the time. It was horrible. Two things really helped me:  One was accepting people’s complements. Not just brushing over them, but intentionally responding to their compliments saying, “Thank you for saying that.” Or something similar. That really helped me believe that those things were true about me. It started to give me a little bit of self-confidence, which was one of the things I really needed most.  The second was really putting the work into something. For me it was music, but it could be anything for you - a hobby, a project. Just something you want to work on and see yourself get better at. The goal is just to see progress. That really helped me to start taking pride in my accomplishments, because it can be very rewarding when you acknowledge that you’re actively bettering yourself. Even if it’s just the smallest thing.   I hope that helps friend. I know what it’s like to be in that place. It’s very dark."

Not to be confused with a good bit of self-deprecating humour.   Anyone remember that Aussie “comic” whose whole “comedy” special about was about not putting herself down anymore? Now that screamed insecurity to me.

"You cant bang subordinates, the waters of consent are muddied when you can fire someone for not fucking you. You seriously dont know why this would be a sound company policy?"
"Yes what a great point. Adults especially will advocate for talking to the “lonely kid” at school or sitting with someone who’s alone, but not only are you being condescending by acknowledging that they need “charity” but what if they genuinely just want to be alone? I sit alone often cause it’s nice and I’d be in a really awkward spot if someone tried to be charitable and I had to turn them down."

I think Trump is a corrupt POS that deserves to be impeached, but that is my opinion. However, this is all opinion, so feel free to disagree.   I apologize if I sounded rude."

"Depending on how you grew up, and how much earlier second kid starts, it might be valid.   I, for example, have never been around young children like that. I have absolutely no idea what any of those time frames are. So with a sample size of 1, I can see myself questioning some of those milestones for a second kid."

She posts vague quotes about breaking up with her on-again-off-again boyfriend constantly then rebuffs any questions or concerns.    She leaves work and/or posts on fb about taking her 20 yr old child (as in kid can’t seem to grow up and do anything without mommy there) to the ER for some phantom pain that needs to be checked.    My favorite is when she ditches a fb account to open a fresh new one after a particularly emotional string of quotes and vague status updates about having no friends or people who care.    She’s a real peach."

It takes a special kind of asshole to dismiss someone talking about their depression as 'just looking for attention' But there are a lot of assholes and its lighter emotionally to dismiss rather than empathize with a depressed person.
"I learned that the best way to get to know someone was to give them power and see what they do with it.  Used this technique before promoting people. I would give them a project and put them in charge to see how they worked with the people under them.   If they were assholes, I could address it. If they did well, I could promote them."

Because in my experience doctors aren't to be trusted and I could see why other people think that way. Hard to trust someone who is hardwired not to trust you. I dont care how many shitty patients you've had. You cant be a good doctor if you dont trust your patients. Why do you think they lie to you to begin with? You already act like you dont trust them and they know you'll be judgemental. I will be literally on my deathbed before I deal with the likes of them. And then you get a huge bill for awful service.

"Actually, that sounds pretty well adjusted to me. Especially that middle bit. I could never understand the 'if they don't like it, fuck em' mindset. There is nothing wrong with adjusting to your environment. It's actually ideal and in no way does one need to surrender their identity.   The other bits you mention?

After seeing this thread it is obvious that I am insecure. What can I do to change that?

I'm mentally checking myself off this list to see if I am insecure.  Does that make me insecure?
"I knew a guy that would do that and constantly throw ""everything always goes wrong in my life boo hoo"" pity parties. I quickly lost respect for him lol."
I don’t think anyone said “everyone” or “all.” Just that is a behavior that people may exhibit because of their self-esteem. And being judgmental is a behavior associated with low self-esteem. You don’t have to have every symptom of something to have something. And judgement does impact your views of others as well as yourself which is pretty well documented.
People that see others just enjoying the interests they have and calling them insecure. I know so many people that'll just call somebody out as insecure because the other person happens to know more than they do or care more about something than they do.

Fun facts : the bigger the guy you see in the gym the more insecure they're
"Had a friend of mine who was like this.  We lived together for a year for Uni, needless to say we're not friends anymore.  The constant one upping felt so fucking needless, like there was nothing to impress at all andndude kept one upping on stupid shit, it was so fucking unnecesary.   I also met a dude who said, at the first time I met him that his grandad had him go to a trip to Madrid and left him in a forest so that he knew how to survive, he said before leaving his grandad gave him a deagle (which btw is really fucking hard to get in Spain for gun control regulations reasons) and he killed a deer with a bow and afterwards ate it. This was all when he was like 14, wtf."
"You aren't being insensitive at all. That's a lot to unpack, but to be honest, I didn't even have a real catalyst until five years after I had already started getting help. I recounted it elsewhere in this thread, but it took me getting a close friend hammered, and then forcing him to tell me what was wrong: That I was the 'friend' in our group that nobody wanted to be around because I was an obnoxious one-upping hyperbolic liar.  Sometimes that stark smack in the mouth is the only thing that works."

"You know I used to be this way.in highschool. I would try to look cool and I would do things to achieve it, It ranged from lying to changing the way I walked etc. But life was a harsh teacher and Everytime I tried to be cool she would trip me up and make me feel dumb. Now I don't try to be cool, but I do hear the nagging voice in the back of my head telling me to do something I wouldn't normally do."
I'm still an insecure pathological liar. What do you do to kick that?

When your social media account is nothing but selfies that are obviously centered around specific body parts.
"My ex line manager used to constantly one up our experiences, stories, travel holiday stories, experiences teaching kids etc. Every sentence started with, “Well my husband and I...”. Without fail. I found it very weird and I thought she was just probably insecure about her marriage. Just last week an ex co-worker told me that it came out she’d been having a FIFTEEN YEAR LONG affair with her best friend’s husband, as ex-line manager’s husband was a FIFO for months at a time, and the guy she had an affair with’s wife was also a FIFO."
Wait but isn't this a paradox because that's means you're secure about your insecurities? 🧐

"People who constantly put other people down, I noticed it in myself a little bit when I was confronted with witnessing a friend have an accident where he couldn't do the job he'd done for 20 years...proceeded to become a very negative bully and only had bad things to say, made me realise when I do those things there is a reason but difference between me and him is I'm taking steps to correct myself whereas he denies he's even in a bad place mentally. We don't really talk much anymore which is a shame, but I wish him all the best."

Spoiler alert- the break-up was two months ago and they are together and happy.   In my heart I knew they were a much better fit despite never meeting her just from the way he would talk about her and it highlighted all my insecurities and I took it out on a girl I didn’t even know.   I actually got to meet her for the first time by chance this past week and while she wasn’t exactly nice to me and didn’t seem to know who I was, I’ll say she’s very pretty and she has a lot of things going for her."

"It's ok to rant. And that's fucked up that people gave you shit for having a baby under 7lbs. Who tf decided 7lbs was the golden weight for babies!? Wtf? Healthy range is like 4lbs and up! Also, congrats on your new baby. I'm so sorry people gave you shit over *completely* arbitrary bullshit. Hope you're doing alright now. And btw, I think people were probably jealous of how small you are.   Some people are smaller and can have babies naturally and some can't. But it doesn't matter and doesn't make anyone any less of a mother for needing a c section. Some people try naturally for fucking ages before docs figure out it's not possible. While other people have super short labors and pop out babies easily.  My mom was 5'3"", had a 23-24in pant size and weighed under 90lbs, I'm like an exact copy of her. She had 2 emergency c sections and then I was a planned c section because they knew it wasn't going to happen otherwise, even though none of us were big babies. My dad was like 5lbs 2oz as a baby, my mom was 6lbs. All 3 of us kids were between their weights, I was the smallest at 5lbs 4oz. *All* perfectly healthy weights. And people who have babies that are under the guides especially shouldn't be shamed because they have to work that much harder!   I stayed small but that didn't affect my health at all. My mom brought me to a Suzuki concert when I was just above a year old, I was wearing a 3-6 month onsie, running around startling people. Sneaking up on them, spook them and they'd turn to see what looked like an infant running away from them. Funny, but fine. And in kindergarten the teacher sent me home with a note one day saying ""while it is cute, we need your daughter to stop letting the other children dress her in the doll clothing.""  Screw the shamers! Be proud you have a healthy baby.  People should never give anyone shit for the size of their babies, and everyone has their own struggles.  Congratulations again on your new baby. I really hope you're doing well, that you and LO are safe and happy. That's all that matters."

"Ha, the timeline comment resonates so much. I had a coworker who was a clerk at a convenience store, I knew him since he was 25, and he was a constant one-upper/braggart. Supposedly before he started at the store, which he did at around 23 yo, he had been a district manager for a corporate coffee chain for a while and someone of varying levels (these positions changed depending) at another retail chain. Plus he had 3 degrees, though he hadn't taken 1 class in the time he worked at the convenience store. He also lived with his mom and wore fedoras regularly, but he stated he used to date a couple of models.  He wasn't bad-looking really, was decently intelligent, and if he could have toned down his lying and braggadocio, he would have been much more socially successful."

"Trying to pin the blame on others instead of accepting the blame yourself.  I’m actually guilty of this because I’m such a perfectionist that I don’t want to accept blame for when I screw up. I try to tel myself to accept the blame if it is my fault, but so afraid of the consequences that I avoid it."
"Right now I am not applying for jobs because I don't want to empower others to waste my time with their ill-informed judgements.   I am not seeking relationships because I am fed up with the garbage.  Its not clear to me if this is insecurity or just basically having had enough of other peoples bullshit.   There are certainly things in my life I am unhappy about, but largely, I just despise the financial system for subjecting me to their crap."
Realize comparison only leads down 2 roads. Either you think the person is better than you which is self-destructive or you think you're better than the person which is just narcissistic. Both are bad so it's better to compare yourself with where your at versus where you were at. In terms of seeking validation just don't do it. Why would you base your happiness on something you can't control?
"It actually took me a while to be secure in my relationship. Until I realized if they're gonna leave, they're gonna leave. If they're gonna cheat, they're gonna cheat. Wasnt until I realized my insecurity about them leaving was going to be the reason they left.  Now I'm at a point, talking to someone? Hanging out with someone? Sure whatever. Just remember where your heart is."

"On the other end I have it happen a lot where someone tells a story, so I bring up an experience I’ve had which may be relevant and they immediately get standoffish. Should I just sit here and not relate after I respond to your story? A lot of people are insecure that they are not the centre of attention, I don’t want to be the centre of attention, and now you’ve made me."
"Sounds to me more like they are being taught one hell of a work ethic at that school, and the real world will definitely care about that."
"Wow. Your assumption is that the OP hadn’t taken that into account. Yes, there are some jobs where men are physically more capable — yet, given the context OP posted saying other women would move locations to avoid working with that specific coworker suggests to me that the playing field is equal. That there is no “better” gender.     Also, your use of the word “fucking” does not increase the soundness of your argument lol. Take a chill pill bro"
"Honestly part of this might not be insecurity but just modern stupidity, a pandemic which is widespread. Everybody lives their lives through social media and won't put their phones down for two seconds to talk to somebody right in front of their face."

"Not that long ago I had this weird interaction with some dude 20 years my senior. We were both freelancers for the same company, but this was the first time I ever had to work with him. He told me about that one time he only counted 30 vehicles the entire day, and how that was the **lowest** he ever got. I laughed with him, told him how useless some assignments seem, and was reminded of the time I had to specifically count agriculture related vehicles. I told him how ridiculous it was, standing there for like 12 hours only for 3 tractors to pass, and expected him to laugh with it.  But his demeanor immediately changed. *'yeah well, the lowest I ever had was 0!'*, turned away with a serious face, and was completely silent after that. His mood went from jolly to offended. Like, calm down dude. And I guess I technically one-upped him first, but it was only about agricultural vehicles so not even in the same category. As if a sprinter tries to one-up a marathon runner about the average speed... That doesn't even make sense."

"Lessons from this thread:  Fuck people.   Just be yourself and be honest and stop trying to impress groups because their reasons for inclusions are usually retarded. Most people just want to continue being their shitty selves without having to be conscious (think about their actions in the third person) of anything, while simultaneously laughing at you for little things they can judge you over...when the only reason they're laughing is because they took a weak-minded conclusion from a small detail early in the conversation rather than understanding the full context of what you're saying. Basically laughing at tiny details of unfavorable candidates (to the military-industrial complex) on comedy Central has made some people turn back into Neanderthals. Imo, it's okay to leave those people behind in the dark ages.  Like the dude who gets offended when his girl goes through his phone...brotha maybe she thinks you're cheating on her because you're cheating on her. If not, show her everything, and repair whatever she insecure about. Fuck...  True entertainment (for catharsis) is nearly dead, politics are about sound bytes and how you look (rather than policy), and being attractive is more about the absence of stigmatizeable details than about being good or nice or well-intentioned or interesting or whatever.   Fight for what you believe in. Don't participate in stupidity. When someone makes fun of someone, don't laugh, just stare back and shake your head. Offend the people who deserve to be offended. Know your worth, and continue to optimize and look for light. You'll find someone on your wavelength one day, and hopefully society is flexible to accommodate both woke and asleep types of people. And uh, vote for knowledge and truth and education and climate. And vote against war and income inequality."
"I knew a pathological liar, but unfortunately he's also a covert narc and on the far end of the spectrum, too. So there's no hope for him LOL.  It's so bad, that he constantly changes his story just to avoid getting caught or trapped, but it ends up in him digging a deeper hole. You can literally just say ""OK"" as a response and just let him tell on himself. I've even seen him say one thing and then the complete opposite 5 minutes later-- through text (and he tried to gaslight me when I sent proof of the texts. That he asked for 😂)"
"IDK, there's a lot of infidelity between friends and partners. She may have been burned before. In general I think it's prudent to avoid those situations to avoid the appearance of impropriety, but being someone who would never do that, it definitely would sting to have a friend say that to you."

"Battling depression while involved in a mentally abusive relationship is a funny thing. One of the first things they do it seems is to program it into your head that you simply cannot and will not survive without them. You need them in your life it will be a failure if you leave.  I probably also should have mentioned that she convinced me to stop taking my medication because antidepressants were all a ruse and a scam by the drug stores, and all I needed to do was have a positive attitude and everything would be better. She read that in the internet somewhere so it must have been true."

"Getting in the 'clicking on this post to verify' train, but, adding some insight. Last year I decided to work on myself. I was very insecure, hid my past and lied about things to fit in. It was a post like this one that helped me work on things to better myself. I worked on my listening skills, stopped trying to fit in and started being myself. Stopped worrying about what other people think. It's still an everyday struggle and the side affect is, my patience with myself, and others, has improved. I discovered I like to write code and develop tools and websites. I got a promotion at work, my personal relationships have improved along with my mental health.  So, if you're here to see if you do these things and discover, you do, maybe it's time for self reflection. It's never too late to  make a change. Don't be afraid to fail. Failing at something is a sign that you are trying. Recover from it and learn from it.  If you made it this far reading and this comment speaks to you, I wish you the best."

"I too have something similar. I now have two stories (both mostly true but somewhat exaggerated) of me being groped. And it’s true that I was groped but not every detail about what happened or what I did about it. The first time it happened was when my (now ex) bf was over at my house. We were upstairs in my room watching bird box. I remember it painfully clearly.   We were at the part of the movie where Malory was screaming at the demon thing not to take her children. That’s when he put his hand under my thigh and started squeezing it in a sexualized way. The next day I talked to my friend about it and she started feeling sympathetic towards me and I kind of enjoyed it.   At the time (and still)I was going through a lot so to have someone who cared about what I was going through was nice. It didn’t truly happen quite as I described it to my friend but if it didn’t really matter then I wouldn’t have remembered it and there is no way in hell I would make something like that up.  The second time it happened was two days ago in my fourth period science class. This guy that I absolutely hate (and he knows that) who I try to stay as far away from was the guy who did it. His name is cole.   I’m not sure if this would be considered groping or not but it felt like it. In that class we have a class pet, a bearded dragon named jarquise. Odd name choice, I know. My friend Alex was holding j(arquise) and j somehow got onto his back. He couldn’t get it off so naturally I stepped in and tried to help.   When Cole noticed I was struggling and came up behind me, putting his arm around me and squeezing the inner side of my left arm saying “don’t worry, I got it” I told him “don’t touch me” but I’m not sure he heard me. I went on a date the next day and the subject of the science teacher who taught that class came up. I told the guy I was in a date with that the teacher hated me (which isn’t really a lie based on how she talks to me compared to the other students) but I used a different example.   I told the whole story of Cole grabbing my arm and making me feel uncomfortable but I added in that Cole had also trailed his hand down to the small of my back and that I had reported it to the science teacher. I also added in that she said “sorry, I can’t help you”.   The truth is cole only grabbed my arm, which did make me feel uncomfortable none the less) and that I never actually reported him because I was scared to. I was scared that my parents would get called and I don’t want to have that conversation with them.  Long story short, being an honest person from the start is a much better solution for getting help than exaggerating stories to get attention every now and then."

"I used to be like this as well, looking back it’s really embarrassing. But like yourself I also lied out of insecurity.   A relationship I was in with a really great woman ended partly because of my inability to tell the truth about stupid shit and then getting tangled in my web of lies. Once that happened I was filled with so much regret and so angry at myself that I vowed never to tell another lie again. Been a couple years now and I refuse to lie about anything now, even if it’s to someone I’ll never see again or a harmless lie."
"Precisely why I said they hadn't even demonstrated a majority.  If I have a certain mental state, and in that mental state we can't determine whether I will do a postive or negative action based on that mental state, then that mental state is not a reliable way to determine my actions. Agreed?  a judgement can impact my views of others in a variety of ways, how did you determine that it necessarily follows that it should be negative?"

Asking people “what screams I’m very insecure”?
"&gt;I was friends with them in elementary school, before girls started getting really catty with one another. Again, a generalization, not a claim about every single woman on the planet.  If that's a generalization you're living, despite your claim that you recognize it's incorrect, you're  still falling into a whole hell of a lot of internalized sexism. It still sounds like you need to look at your own actions if your only female friends are friends from before girls *inevitably* fall into their catty phase. It's one thing if it just happens to be that you connected with a group of guys who happened to like hiking, while the other girls you'd met recently preferred to bake, but if you're drawing lines between genders instead of hobbies or core values, it's time for some introspection."

"I was the insecure one in my last relationship, but my ex was the controlling one. The most I did was look at her Apple Watch and found out she was sleeping with other guys, which I kinda figured when she left at 1 am and I didn’t see her until 6 in the evening the next day. She didn’t let me keep in contact with friends from my old town. She didn’t like me talking with other people at all. I mean fuck she came to work with me a quite a few times. I now live 7 hours away from her back in my old town, I feel so disconnected from my old friends, and she’s still trying to keep tabs on me and what I’m doing."

"I'm insecure as fuck so I pick up on others who are also insecure. The biggest thing I do with my insecurity is cave in on myself at the first mention of me doing something wrong. It could literally be anything. If I think I did something wrong or slightly offended someone, I tend to implode in on myself and apologise profusely. If I know the other person is insecure, I feel even worse and go into a frenzy trying to fix it.   However, I also have an opposite affect of that. If I know, 100% I did nothing wrong or whatever I'm talking about is true beyond reasonable doubt, I stone wall the fuck out of it.   The few things I have in life I'm certain on I refuse to ever let anyone make me doubt again.

Too many resources spent on it, too much time money energy.  I've worn makeup I've not worn makeup and people much nicer to me first when I do wear makeup but then I have to take a look at the motives of those people so then I don't wear makeup and then a different group of people are nicer to me and then I have to look at their motives and at the end of the day I am learning to live my best life with or without the paint."

"I had a guy I knew (former friend for a reason) who was so insecure he would not stop doing this, and would berate everyone (one of the reasons I stopped being his friend).   Well we had a pretty big arguement and we broke our friendship off. One of the guys we were mutual friends with stayed in touch, so the guy asked this friend to tell me he wanted to talk to me. He said something like ""hey can you tell Clemen11 I wanna talk? I'm a good person now"".  Knowing the guy, I replied the perfect thing to prove he wasn't. ""I don't know a single good person who has to say they are in order for others to believe him.""  Naturally, his insecurities got the best of him and he went on a massive rant about how he was better than me, bragging about having sex more often because I was in a LDR. Hypocritical as fuck, if you ask me, as he used to be in one till the girl left him for berating her constantly to prop himself up. Anyway. My response to his rant about having more sex was ""but... I have a faithful girlfriend""  Our mutual friend, who was acting as the middle man, decided not to send that and end our convo there because he knew the other guy just as much as I did, and knew it would be a major dick move, so he ended it there."

This is mostly false. Getting rid of the particulate filters and other diesel emissions equipment seriously improves the engines lifespan and power. It also increases fuel economy. However it is worse for the environment. “Rolling coal” is stupid and looks dumb but it will still increase fuel economy over stock in a diesel truck.

"At some point do you stop and think ""maybe this is just how he talks?"" I'm pretty sure he knows he's not the best at everything ever, but rather is using a superlative rhetorical strategy.  To put it simply, he's speaking for the impact, not the abstract."
"You're partially wrong here. Tuning a diesel and removing a lot of the restrictive emissions crap is actually better for the truck in a lot of ways, including fuel efficiency. HOWEVER- the coal rolling retards are not using the proper tunes for efficiency, they are abusing the fact they have a basically jailbroken ECM and doing it for their small dick lulz.  The emissions regulations in California are what made manufacturers design much larger engines, to accommodate the loss of power directly caused by the emission systems required. Larger engines require more fuel, and all engines need more fuel to make more power. Removing the emissions from the engine allows it to breathe easier and thereby use less fuel overall-when properly tuned.  I have a new-ish Ram with a Cummins, unmodified, and get 23 mpg highway. I could do a couple of mpg better if I did a delete and tune, but would lose warranty."

"Sounds like you should find a primary care physician that actually listens to you. As someone who works in health care, what you're describing is a very small percentage of doctors. Most doctors will listen to what you have to say because they understand that you know your body better than they do.  You also have to understand the other side of the coin though... You're not gonna want to hear everything the doctor has to tell you, and if you treat your physician poorly or act like you're better than them (or have more medical knowledge than someone with a PhD) you'll probably lose credibility pretty quickly."

"Please, I saved an injured kitten from a hungry bobcat and that kitten belonged to the Chieftan and as thanks I got to bang his 18 year old virgin daughter in the village square and everyone watched and chanted my name.  Plus...after seeing me naked, there was a line of women who wanted to be banged by me next and their husbands said that it would be an honor for them to chant my name as I banged their wives.  But, I don't talk about it often because it's just an average Tuesday for me..."

When I scream at my friends to stop attacking my insecurities.
"To clarify, they had good health insurance.  As in $20-30 for a copay and could afford it.  They would both share their photos of pricey, artisanal cocktails, etc.  If you can afford $20 for a drink, you can afford $20 to see a doctor to find out if you aspirated something or you think you're coughing up blood."
"This is so true, I’ve overheard conversations that people talk about not getting sleep to seem cool. “I went to bed at 1:30” “I went to bed a 2:00”. Last week my friend said he went to bed at 4:30 just to seem cool."
"I've noticed alot of my acquaintances low-key view most conversations as a competition centered around stories that we are telling each other. Constant dick-measuring over menial tasks (their ability to get drunk/consume liquor is a regular talking point). Nobody seems to be listening if you don't seem to have a punch line you're winding up to.  I am equally as guilty. Somebody will tell me something. Say, about a trip they took in the countryside. My go-to response is usually an example of my own where I did something similar. It's a knee jerk attempt at sympathizing. ""I've done that too!"". But they way we're all communicating they seem to take it as me dismissing or devaluing their experience. To fix this I've tried to specially ask people questions about experiences they are relaying to me.  As douchey as it is to finish with, the line from Fight Club always stood out. The one about how everybody is simply sitting around for their turn to speak.   Self-importance or self-aggrandizement is a major sign of insecurity."

"I will say, I (as a straight man) have found myself just making more, closer friends with women. Sometimes you do just end up getting along with the other gender better in general. The distinction is probably that this isn't something that should be waved around as some sort of badge of honour or virtue. Sometimes it just happens due to your personality and interests, things happen. So long as you don't use it define yourself as some especially unique, 'interesting' figure as a result."

I assure you that your daughter adores you and looks up to you in every way. What would you say your favorite thing about spending time with her is?"

One lasted 3 years, one lasted just shy of 6 and I was convinced it would lead to marriage. We even talked about it. I struggle with my insecurities every time my SO goes out, or spends time with their friends of the opposite sex. Most of the time I can keep it under wraps. Occasionally it turns into a fight about my trust issues.   Question for you redditors: how many of you would be cool with your SO going on a day trip 2 hours away with their childhood BFF thats the opposite sex?

My final therapist, the one that finally figured me out, worked backwards from the lies and bullshit and traced it all the way back through my shielded insecurities, and rooted out where those insecurities were based.   He made me face a lot of compartmentalized trauma from when I was a kid that I had completely forgotten about, things like verbal and physical abuse, molestation, and so on. Once we started breaking it all down and I started eventually finding peace with those memories - and in turn my insecurities - I started to unconsciously check myself when talking to people. I noticed that I would constantly remind myself to just be honest, keep it short, and if necessary, be blunt. It was a gradual change over the course of a year or two."

"In this case, the little girl started walking early because crawling didn't work well for her.  The parents liked to dress her up like a doll with lots of frills, lace, and ruffles.  (Her outfits were cute, but made her look like a little square dancer.)  Her little knees would catch on the skirt tails, and she couldn't move forward.  She figured out how to toss her little butt up in the air (which mortified the parents as it was very immodest and unladylike) and move along on her hands and feet, then skipped ordinary crawling altogether.  The doctor told them if they'd dressed her in simpler clothing, she likely would have crawled first instead.

Also what we perceive as what makes someone an asshole is subjective. I might think someone isn’t an asshole and you might think they’re the biggest jerk ever right? I’ve had coworkers that were very upfront like “hey john you talk about losing weight I think you should put the soda down”  I personally think the guy who tells everyone he wants to lose weight and then actively doesn’t stick to his goals is the asshole because we gotta hear about his self inflicted problems. He’s conveyed to us that he knows what needs to be done and doesn’t do it and then is sad about it and we gotta deal with it. Figure it out John!

My husband had to fly to his home country to be with his dad while I stayed with my family. My husband isn't typically very romantic, but while he was away, he made a facebook post about how grateful he was to have me and how I was his best friend, etc. We really had to lean on each other through it, and thanks to that, neither of us collapsed. I think his post was entirely genuine.   I have ocassionally caught myself gushing about how much I admire him, but it's never been because of insecurity. I'm just proud of him and our relationship.  Also my dogs. If I brag about my goodboys, it's because they really are a good boys."

Unfortunately, this tendency among particular groups can become out of control,  leading to examples like yours where everyone not in the group is too different (different means danger to the status quo) to be included - and must therefore be turned away pre-emptively.

It wasn't because she *wanted* to do that, but because she was nervous to be on her own in a new town.

She has not ever and does not currently like her job.  I just can't imagine being so timid that I let the terms of my life be dictated by fear like that.

"It comes from having no life outside of being a stay at home mom.  I saw this Joni Mitchell interview... she was explaining baby boomers... zzzz... but she talked about competitive 1950s housewives. Women worked during WWII and earlier than that, on the farm or selling eggs for ""pin money"" Once they had to stay at home in suburbs, as housewives, after WWII ended, all they had to show for themselves was how neat their house was etc.  But yeah, if you are a stay at home mom feeling insecure about not working, you plow 100% of your energy into your kids and you have to justify being a stay at home mom. You let people know how early your kid was toilet trained, all the special food you cook etc.  Throw in some ""mom brain"" (it's a thing, while pregnant I almost got hit by a car not paying attention to traffic) and isolation at home, and you have someone who focuses on all their kids milestones etc"

Admittedly, it was because if my dad heard that I said something he disagreed with, he'd declare that I was disrespectful for saying it and then beat me for being disrespectful. Not expressing opinions kind of became a habit.  That said, beating your kid because they said something you disagree with is probably also a sign of insecurity."

"Pretty much one of my classmates. One thing he really likes to do is ask me to do something I'm currently learning or working on. If I accept, he'll make fun of it or downplay it. If I refuse, then apparently I haven't been good enough at it. I've never heard a single encouragement from him, always something negative. His primary method of making friends is similar too: basically shit talk a person behind their back with whomever he wants to be friends with and play it off as a casual joke.  If y'all got advice on how to deal with toxic people, I'll take it. I got a year of college left and this gets annoying. I've been distancing myself from the guy lately and that seems to be mildly effective."

"I think they're referring to attachment disorders, which often includes insecurity as part of the symptoms but not always. Also, the insecurity there is often better identified as a trust issue and/or external validation issue.  With trust issues, it's not precisely that the person is insecure in themselves, but is insecure about their relationships with others; it can spin out further into control issues and things like manipulation and emotional abuse, often with the excuse of ""testing"" it.  With external validation issues, the person is indirectly ego-centric - that is, they are insecure in themselves unless other people validate their value with attention, admiration, and seeking them out. The indirect part is that they often have low self-esteem, so they don't realize they're being ego-centric by valuing relationships based on how much it bolsters their ego.   Both of these happen from time to time for most people. They're only issues when they cause persistent and/or significant problems for the person and/or others attempting to have a meaningful relationship with them."

"Putting down other's opinions to solidify your own. I notice it a lot when it comes to purchases for stuff like gaming. Not in a joking way, but adamantly suggesting someone's opinion means nothing because you have to justify how your money was spent.  I wasn't a fan of Read Dead Redemption 2 but found Fallout 76 fun, so my opinion wasn't allowed to matter. That conversation literally ended up with the guy trying to argue with me bragging about how much sex he has. This was in an Xbox Live party too."

It’s the pin cite to Justice Stevens’ “There is something fishy about this case” line.
the richest dudes are always the most lowkey about it
"You're being incredibly dishonest. And for the benefit of the doubt, let's say you're being serious. There are plenty of things that sound good on paper or are conceptualized by a desire to do good, that either end up dead in the water or turned into a terrible perversion of what they sought out to become.  As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
Driving a big pickup truck with Calvin stickers peeing on something
"I think that is exactly where a motorcycle should be loud...especially with everyone texting and driving or not paying attention in general, having a loud motorcycle says “hey I’m right fucking here. Don’t fucking kill me.” Far too often are people on motorcycles being hit due to others not paying attention and if being loud helps prevent that, then let them. If you can’t deal with the sound then slow down and let them get away from you. Or turn up the radio. Safety &gt; your opinion."
"Agreed. Sometimes it's coming off more as ""oh that sucks. I've been there before. I had \_\_\_\_\_\_ happen."" It isn't about showing you had it worse or you're better. It's a way of expressing empathy or bonding through shared experiences.     Some people will still hate it, but that's not one persons fault in particular."

Pretty much any time someone boasts how good they are at anything unsolicited then you can confidently know they’re not. The two personality traits that contribute to that most are insecurity and narcissism and neither are conducive to progress.

"Close, anthropology. I’m on the “harder science” side, paleoanthropology, but because we encompass everything from fossil digs and forensics to cultural studies, people lump all of anthropology in with humanities.

"Mainly, history. She's a good friend to me, always has been, I've known her for almost a decade. The way I see it, her relationships are hers, and when I've tried to just explain to her how i see it, it's been met with stubbornness and passive aggression. I get it tho, as a stubborn woman myself, I don't want to hear how my friends don't like my partner.   She's just very insecure, she's always been on the heavier side, and despite my opinion of her being one of the most beautiful people I know, she focuses so much on her weight and looks due to traumatic and harmful things her mom said in childhood. I still love her--all I can do is be there for her and keep trying to tell her how beautiful she really is and hope that she sees it someday.  Edit: Human relationships are complex, and female friendship is complicated. But you don't always have female friends who will be there for you through thick and thin. She has been one of those for me. It's not easy for me to just give up on her and our friendship. Maybe that makes ME insecure."
A lot of people have this issue due to the fact that their parents never stopped comparing them to more successful siblings. Even without siblings they’ll always find something. “so-and-so got famous at 19 yet your 27 doing blah blah blah”

"So, the hospital thing I can see both sides. If you have a chronic illness, being in and out can be extremely isolating. I have chronic illnesses and when I was going through major surgeries or hospital stays I would use my Facebook to keep my family and support groups informed and to ask if anyone had tried alternative treatments and their success rates.  I’m the healthiest I’ve been in years and don’t post when I go to the doctor, but I understand when people post frequently if they are experiencing things similar to what I did. Being in a hospital for months or weeks at a time is incredibly isolating and at times social media can make you feel a little less disconnected.  I understand 100% where you are coming from, and some do it for attention, but I wanted to give a slightly different perspective."

"Same here, I was a very insecure teen and lied and bullshitted about everything. I thought everyone believed me, but I can see now that mostly it was just pity.  I stopped when I was about 17 and overheard a group of people I respected talking about how obviously bullshitting I was.  I stopped lying there and then. Even very justifiable white lies are very hard for me to say now, I tend to avoid those situations instead.  It does make life a bit harder, but I feel so much better for it. And it has lasted over 30 years now, so I think it's properly fixed!"

It was like you could always tell where the real story ended and the lie/exaggeration began. It was always so weird to me, because I liked the person to begin with, and never understand why they felt the need to bullshit me. I just wanted to shake them and be like ""Be yourself!"""

"Woman I worked with.  Would post something like ""I helped someone today"" and a photo of a random homeless person with a story of how she bought him a sandwich.    She would also post pictures of her bringing Granny a Big Mac at the home.  Years after she had died."
She didn't trusting him on what? It takes two people to cheat so it can't be on that (or she does not trust anyone and is therefore very insecure). So not trusting he would not rape her? That would be insane to think of your husband this way unless very rare circumstances. Way more likely she is insecure.
"Thank you for this. I really struggle with taking compliments. I never realized it until it was brought up recently. Anytime someone complimented me on something I quickly had something negative to say back. For example if someone complimented me on my hair I’d say something like “ Thank you,  it’s kind of messy today.”"
Its a strange one because you could also say that a lot of people are insecure because they overly self reflect

I realized he had been lying to me about a lot of things (education background, career, talents he claimed to have), and I called him out on them. He admitted to them and I realized that he lied not out of malice but because he was insecure about his achievements.  I stayed with him on one condition: he needed to come clean to everyone in his life. It was tough but he did it. Yes, some frenemies did bash him for it, but the real friends stood by him and supported him.  3 years later, life is really good for us. He's proud to boast about his real accomplishments now. And he's a lot happier too.  I hope the same for you. The sooner you get to work on the truth, the sooner you'll reap the benefits."

Women tend to have two types of friendships, genuine friends and strategic friends."

Right before we started talking, I did say that I was talking to someone else too but nothing of course was official.

He was a little mad about it too. Like dude...I’m with YOU right now, I wanna talk about YOU. He got really annoying and slightly clingy considering we had *just* started talking so I had to break it off.  Then guess what...he claimed that I went to be with the other guy and said I “wasted his time and should’ve been honest”.....like I didn’t already say I was talking to someone else before...btw I didn’t go to the other guy. He was just super insecure and it wasn’t my job to coddle his self-esteem."

"People who are obnoxiously loud and never stop talking to the people around them (more than just being a talkative person). It seems like these people are always after some sort of social acknowledgement.      Also, people who downvote comments on Reddit only because they disagree with them. Be more afraid of opposing ideas. Censor them, in stead of addressing them. Definitely makes you look very confident in your own ideas that the only way you can have them persist is by bludgeoning other people's ideas with this platform's very own built-in hive mind button. Looking at you, r/ politics."

"I'm glad to hear you say that, because for no reason that I'm consciously aware of, I've done a 180 on this subject. It used to drive me *nuts* when vague acquaintances, friends of friends whom I've just met that evening or whatever,  would admit to me or a general group that they dealt with/suffered from depression, mania, or similar disorders. It didn't piss me off, exactly, but, i dunno, it just completely flabbergasted me. I felt like, *Why?* Why just admit your weakness to people you barely know? Why trust veritable *strangers* with such intimate information?  What could one possibly gain from it? *What is the bleeding point ??!*  Now though, I also completely see it as a sign of strength. When people are openly discussing these very personal issue with someone who hasn't exactly earned their trust yet, I think ""There you go. This person is a fighter. You're using every damn tool in your arsenal, and you're not letting a fear have control of you. Eff yeah."" I like it better this way."

"So you're apparently judging people for a well-documented cognitive bias where the tendency is for experts to underestimate their own ability. The implication is that they don't actually have a conscious choice about this. Experts *also* tend to understate everything so there's less chance they can be certainly proved wrong, *even* if they correctly estimate their own ability. This may be because they're looking to moderate damage, if the (presumably unlikely) worse-case-scenario occurs.  But hey. Judge away."

"Dunno if you're serious or not but introspection is a skill you have to learn. Just identify the problem, work out a solution, implement said solution. It's much easier said than done. I've been on a year long introspective journey and I'm nowhere near where I want to be as a person, but with patience and diligence it's possible to mold your personality like clay."
"Thanks so much for that. Every mom could use that kind of encouragement, and I'll tell you, hearing it kinda made my day.  I think you might be surprised at how much fortitude you have being a mother. It's been such a rocky road with my oldest. I thought I wasn't going to survive the day so many times, but I did. I don't know how we did it, but I remember during the worst of it, I didn't think I could. As a mom, you know that you love your kids no matter what, so when you look back, you see that you had a strength and patience you didn't know was possible. There isn't another outcome. You have the same strength because no matter what challenges you face, you'll meet them head on. You don't need to be told to cherish every moment because when your daughter is grown up, you'll reflect on her baby days lovingly. I want to say don't lose sight that it was tough. That's the accomplishment. I try to remember that when other moms have commentary about what I'm doing and how I'm doing it...well, they're struggling too. Their kids have definitely had one of those diaper blowouts that defied gravity and shot straight up their designer baby clothes. They pooped while giving birth or got hemorrhoids or have a gnarly c-section scar the same as I do. We're all fighting the same fight whether or not we show that truth to others or we brag about Jimmy's yodeling skills on the playground. Sometimes the thing we are most proud of is just surviving.   Thanks for believing in me. I believe in you too, and your life will right itself. Kindergarten will save your life."

"People who are rude to you off the bat, and in some cases, people who refuse to make eye contact with you.   I worked as a server for a long time, and there is a distinct difference between shy, confident and insecure people. Insecure people often don't acknowledge you at all when you start speaking and will determinedly keep eye contact with either the other person at the table as if they need to monitor how their SO or friend treats you. They will make no effort to leave the distain out of their voice if they do speak to you. It's awkward because I'm just doing my job, and you are acting like I'm treading on your territory even though we don't know each other.  Shy people are different, they just stare at their fork when you talk, which I totally get, or talk quietly or avoid eye contact, but in a way where you can tell they are doing their best, and they know it's on them and not you.  I distinguish shy and insecure because often shy people simply feel bad about their social skills, but once you let them know you aren't scary they will relax a bit and show  you their lovely self.  Insecure people don't like themselves so they have a much harder time showing you their vulnerable side, which honestly I've learned not to mind, but it still feels sad when someone feels like they need to make you feel unimportant because I know that it doesn't feel good for them either."

"My thoughts too. If they feel comfortable enough to bring it up then its asking for help. I generally wouldnt tell people im ""ill"" unless its a close friend and i cant do it alone anymore, i would just hope that friend wouldnt see it as a brag or a ""weird flex"", and choose to be supportive.   Looking for support and looking for attention are two totally different things."

"There was a parkway I always drove to work that had an on ramp like an interstate. The traffic was always bumper-to-bumper and going about 45, so you had to be at the speed limit by the end of the ramp to have any chance of getting onto the parkway without causing an accident.  One morning I got behind this old lady who was going down the on ramp going no exaggeration 15mph. She somehow bumbled onto the road but I got stuck at the end of the on ramp. Within five seconds of stopping, I had a giant road tank of a truck truck 6"" from my bumper, laying on the horn and flashing its brights. The truck and its flashing lights filled every single mirror I had. How in the ***flying fuck*** am I supposed to get onto the road any faster with your giant truck blocking my entire view of the road? After that morning, I found a different way to get onto the parkway that didn't involve an on-ramp."

"Titanic- Jack Gets Put Down   Jack's POV  It was the middle of the night and I got out of bed.  I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  I was hit in the neck with a tranquilizer dart.  Cal came out with his servant.  ""Sweet dreams, thief,"" he said before I fell asleep... permanently.  ...   As he lay unconscious, unaware of his impending doom, he dreamt that he was punching the snobby, rich man in a tuxedo. He didn't normally punch people, but Cal deserved it more than anything.  Jack was angry. Jack had done so much for Rose, and all he gets in return is a needle in the neck and kindergarten nap-time. He had never been more embarrassed in his life.  He wished his mother was still alive.  She was a kind, caring woman. She hugged him, kissed him, and put him to bed with milk and cookies every night. Why, she even used to tuck him in to make sure he was comfy!  Unconsciously, Jack began to look anxious.  Then, finally, he stopped dreaming and began to snore.  The water began to creep in.  ""May I, sir?"" said Lovejoy pointing his revolver at the young man.  Cal restrained Lovejoy.  ""No. He has to suffer. He stole my girl and everyone else's hearts,"" said Cal feeling a pang of jealousy."

"In the spirit of one upping one uppers the guy I knew while I was stationed overseas:   Had a super rich lawyer girlfriend in the states  Had killed a guy in defense of said GF, who then got him cleared of all because he killed the guy not in self defense but to prevent him from hurting her in the future, i.e. murder.  Had a tattoo of a red hand on his shoulder (real), because his great-something grandfather sailed over on one of the first ships to America, and the ship captain promised a big chunk of land to the first person to touch shore. Several crew members immediately jump overboard and begin swimming to shore. His ancestor, in his infinite wisdom, decided to instead cut off his hand and throw it ashore, thereby 'touching' land first. I'm not going into the physics of that."

"Well, that IS a somewhat questionable practice, isn't it? It's not uncommon for people to playfully have a secret crush and for couples to have an equally-playful 'free-pass'.  But the crush is something -if circumstances were right- that you would carry out to it's logical, intimate conclusion, whereas the free pass is truly a running gag between the couple; if either actually met their free pass, it would be a 'handshake/Idmireyourwork/itwasnicetomeetyou'.  What YOU were doing is telling the entire world that you were operating in celebrity-crush mode ('There is no restriction whatsoever to Donald Glover doing whatever to he wants to me, at any time 24/7/365), when -in fact- you were half of a couple.  Plus? You did it 'often'. He likely should have been mad at himself for being in the relationship.  And you hadn't even agreed on a (joking) free-pass, yourselves.  Correct?  If you want to have SO relationships, you should take the adolescence off of your social media. You SHOULD be free to show your inner-child but do it in person. People will know you're an actual adult under those circumstances.  Why do I feel like I misspent the last 10 minutes?.."

Now I have all of these things to do that I feel like I can't handle, and she is the biggest responsibility.  I can't just sleep all day.  I can't walk away when I am stressed.  Right now, I just can't handle that with the kind of grace a mother should be able to.  I love experiencing her excitement.  Time is my ""love language"", so I most enjoy hearing about what she likes.  Watching her play pretend.  Answering her questions.  Teaching her things.  Most of my favorite things to do with her just aren't going to happen a lot at her age.    As far as this specific stage, I do like snuggling together before nap and bedtime.

My coworker does this all the time. I work at a law firm and of the 3 paralegals under my attorney I have been at the firm longest so he says I have the “most experience” because I know how the firm works. My coworker tho has had 20-30 yrs experience as an actual paralegal and I’ve only had 5-6 yrs. so it’s obvious what my boss means. And every time my boss said this he would go into this long monologue about how all his cases are ready to settle. All these other cases are settled blah blah blah. It got to the point where my boss had to start saying I had more experience *at the firm*. But he still does it. They congratulate me on settling a big case and he butts into the conversation to say how many big cases he has settled and are about to settle. I have literally stopped engaging in any conversations with him because of it. And he does this in every single conversation whether or not he was in the conversation or not. It’s ridiculous. I can’t stand it. And he’s so adamant that he knows more than I do that even when he does have a question he refuses to ask me for help even though I know more about the system than he does. We are on a team yet I constantly feel like in his own mind it’s just one big competition.

"I have a sorta friend like this but I'm getting so fucking tired of it. I don't have much friends anymore from social anxiety and each time I want to talk about my mental health, this guy is like, ""I have the same problem"" about everything I say I have, even though he has a ton of friends and is dating usually 24/7 of the year. Like when one girl breaks up with him or he cheats on them like he usually does, he has a backup girl ready to go. How the fuck are you so social if you have social anxiety? ugh. It just frustrates me because I only have a dumb psychiatrist to talk about my problems with, everyone else doesn't even want to here about anything, so that just makes me more depressed. I want to move away from all these people I use to consider friends because whenever I hang out with them I feel like such shit later (mentally)."

"For my password I've been using a combination of my middle name and my first bike lock combination since I was a young kid. I've made it more complicated over the years due to paranoia and finally a couple years ago I decided to make the password unique for each site/service.   If I was using the yellowelephantairplanepilot for my base password, it might look like this:   XYyellowelephant!2!airplanepilotAB  The 2 is a category code where only I know the categories (like commo, finance, commerce, etm.) There are 9 in total. Not super hard to remember.   The XY is based off the name of the website or service. I take the letter and move a certain direction (keyshifts) a certain number of keys based on the category code, and then another letter from the name and move a different way to get the 2nd letter. Each of the 9 category codes has a different keyshift.  The AB is another set of keystrokes similarly based on the site name.   So I have a ""reusable"" password that's unique to each site by at least 2 characters, and all I have to remember is the key algorithms for the site name, the key algorithm for the catcode+first key, and the categories.   If someone gets one of my passwords they won't be able to determine the password for other sites or even that the keystrokes are site-name determined if they get multiple passwords."

Such as spurious public rape allegations without police report or conviction, proclamations of attacks such as domestic violence without any evidence or any other allegations of victimisation. I used to give these fuckers the benefit of the doubt now I ask for proof, warn of libel and immediately leave company or sack or report to HR if I can't. I've never had an allegation against my self but I've known some one who has. Seriously avoid these people they are danger to you &amp; are exhibiting mental illness.  That's my answer the polar opposite of what you said."

"Yes, it's far better to go straight to PhD and have a PI sponsor you - but the masters -&gt; PhD route is easier to start up with, as admissions to the master's program is significantly less selective than that for bachelor's -&gt; PhD, given you're paying your own first two years of coursework.   Another reason might be if you're not sure you want to commit to the PhD. But if it's your field of choice, I think in this day and age there's not really a great reason to get a master's for the sake of a master's (by that I mean excluding things like MS pre-MD or something). It doesn't really set yourself very far apart from a plain ol BS, and you're already halfway to the PhD - now you can do the actually interesting part of the PhD, your independent research. And the PhD actually opens up a lot of new doors for you careerwise. In many fields/companies it's impossible to reach high tier positions without a doctorate-level degree, and even if your field/company is one where that's not the case, there are other benefits."

"Said task of finding a primary care person is pretty hard whether there's a doctors shortage, at least where I am. I go to two separate clinics. One has my primary and the other had my pain specialist. Both have lost doctors/nurse practitioners in the last few months. I tried to book in to see my primary and the soonest they could get me in was in a month, and this was for an urgent issue.  I can also relate with the previous posters difficulty with getting doctors to trust. I've had rheumatoid arthritis for over 20 years and moved a couple years ago. It took me forever to get the pain medications I needed because my primary didn't have 'proof' of my condition. It was suggested multiple times that I had become hyper sensitive to pain. I continued to become more disabled by pain and finally saw a rheumatologist here and he basically fucked the dog while examining me. Telling my I needed to see a psychiatrist and that he didn't think I'd ever had arthritis. All the while he hadn't read any of my previous rheumatologists notes because he hadn't ordered my file, despite the appointment having been scheduled over 6 months prior. The silly thing is how obvious it is I have it by looking at my hands. Anyway, beg my primary for a referral to another rheum, ever though there are NO OTHERS in town accepting referrals. Thankfully, she emailed one in town that she knew of with some of my info and she agreed to see me. Took months to see her, but when I finally did she said it was obvious I had some sort of inflammatory disease, likely rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. As of a few days ago she now believes I may also have an inflammatory disease in my muscles, so I'm being sent to a neurologist for testing.  For all the time I've spent seeing doctors I can say with a great amount of certainty that a lot of them don't want to look past their nose. If they can't explain it, it must be mental. There are many many many shitty doctors out there. Many don't get brought to light because the general layperson does not have the knowledge or resources to bring the Doctor to some sort of justice."

I worked as an auto insurance adjuster for a time and by far the most common accident I saw were rear endings. I would say easily 3/4 of what I dealt with, so it's super common. I always get furious when people tailgate me now, especially in situations like you described, because you're putting us both at risk and for what? Even if I move over, you're not going anywhere. The worst claim I dealt with involved someone being killed after being rear ended, so I've seen what can happen and don't appreciate people putting my life at risk."

I have a friend who always rubs his master’s degree in my face. I’m 25 and still in undergrad because I took time off to travel. He likes to use it as the thing he has over me or the proof that he’s more intelligent. I never say anything to him about it though because I think that he might need that source of confidence.
Posting how you aren’t insecure
"I use to have a friend (use to bring the key term here) who was insecure to the point of toxicity for the entire time I knew her. She was my first friend, and only friend until late high school, so I didn't know that a lot of what she did wasn't what friends do. Case in point: she would constantly degrade me about my weight, telling me I have an eating disorder (which I don't. I do. However, have wicked acid reflux that makes it hard for me to eat sometimes when I feel like throwing up acid) and would ""steal"" the people I had crushes on just to tell me later that she gets what she wants and it's my fault for not being interesting enough. That girl always had to have people telling her how amazing/beautiful/talented she was or else she would make drama just to seem like the victim so she could gain sympathy. She even went so far (years down the road) as to wear white to another friends wedding and held every thing up because she insisted she had to look her best. (I actually confronted her on that, saying that she wasn't the bride and it wasn't her day, and if she continued to cause drama at the wedding I would personally grab her by the scruff of her neck and kick her out.) I did cut the girl out of my life, after many years of trying to help her and show her how her actions hurt those around her (she refused to believe she was less than perfect when confronted); but it makes me sad seeing someone so controlled by their insecurities that it turned them into a terrible person. To me, being insecure is okay to a point, it keeps you humble and open to improvement, but not to the point it makes you toxic."
I take it you're not (yet!) in perfect shape? Just take the complement bro.

Also people that thinks this way are insecure too. I feel when I tell a story and somebody else tells another story similar to my story I don’t feel like they are one upping me. I feel like I triggered a memory on their mind and they are sharing this memory with me. I find it as a way to relate to one another.

"Mine is kinda stupid, I'm insecure about telling something true, but being told that I'm simply lying, or just wanting attention. My mother is the one who made me feel ashamed of telling the truth, and does it in almost every argument.  If someone else feels like that, tell your story if it's true, there are always going to be people who aren't going to believe you, but a lot of people will. You shouldn't have to feel bad about the truth."
"Been in sales my entire career.  The sales dept is typically a vile, toxic environment (HR would have a heart attack).  When dumb assholes start making more money than they know what to do with, the dumbest of the assholes start talking loudly about how much money they make, what kind of boat they're gonna buy, look at the new car I bought, I just spent 10k on this watch, look at my commission report, etc etc etc.  I ignore most of it but sometimes I have to pipe in. I told this one particularly unpleasant asshole ""2 coins in a piggy bank make more noise than one filled with cash"".  Sales is a weird animal because unlike other depts, your success and worth to the company has a very quantifiable and clear number attached to it, your sales numbers. So someone closes a big deal and goes out and spends their entire commission check on a boat and you don't stop hearing about it.  You'd be surprised how many people I worked with making 200k+ a year living paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, I keep my head down, make my money quietly, and actually having a savings. Then I quit, take a few months off traveling (last time I took off a year), and do the whole thing again. Worked out pretty well so far."
"We use to have this guy in our group of friends back in high school who lied about everything. Everything. We called him out on it and he would either have another lie ready or just shrug it off.  My favorite lie of his was that before he came to America (he was from Dominican Republic) he used to be a trained ninja soldier (his exact words) and he went to jail for killing a foreigner in his country and escaped and found his way to America to be with his other family here and hide from the DR government.   He 100% was not joking with us. He said this with full conviction in his voice and never expected to be challenged on his stories.  He annoys me more because I let him borrow my brothers bootleg Naruto dvd collection at the time and he lied about giving it to another friend to borrow and essentially stole my dvd set.   Oh and then when I went off to college in another state and came back to Boston to visit family he apparently told everyone I was becoming a famous comic book artist. I don't know why. I'm not that great of an artist and I was in school for information technology at the time.  Oh wait, I know why. Because he fucking lied about everything."

"Thank you! Running into them by chance really helped- they met very shortly after we started dating and she either 1) truly had no idea who I was which is pretty eye-opening all things considered or 2) she did know who I was and acted like she didn’t which means he told her about our relationship while almost definitely omitting every dumb hurtful thing he did regarding her and otherwise.   I feel weirdly guilty, like I somehow willed this into existence because I felt uneasy about her early on and he would lay on the “love means trust, how can you love me if you don’t trust me?”. I stupidly asked what she had that I didn’t and he just said confidence, which made my head spin. Unsurprisingly I’m feeling 100x more confident and less anxious now that he’s not in my life.   Overall, a solid life lesson."

"I was one of the oldest people in my grad program, and it was a blessing and a curse. A curse because everyone else had just come out of undergrad and was still in the groove of studying. A blessing because I just didn’t give a fuck. Didn’t get an A, but still understand the material? Cool. Don’t need to kill myself for the grades, just need to understand the material and pass.   I have 3 national licenses. I’ve only passed one of the exams outright on the first try. The other two I had to retake. Oh well. Ya know who cares? Not a damn person. Not one prospective employer has asked for my grades. Not a single person has asked how many times I needed to take the test. All they care about is that I’m licensed.   It’s not a race, it’s a journey. Enjoy the ride. The only person who you should compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday. If you’ve learned one new thing, had one new experience, talked to one new person, picked up one new book, you’re better than you were the day before. If you’ve been kind to someone, helped them, made someone smile, pet a dog, did the right thing, or texted someone you haven’t spoken to in a while, you’re a better person than you were the day before because you made someone’s world a bit brighter. Focus on that. The rest will follow."

It worked because people are insecure and stupid.   Tldr; Generally, conspicuous consumption."

I've found what helps is simply asking people about themselves and getting interested in what they have to say.

He was a Marine, did 2 tours in Afghanistan (actually true). Claimed he got blown up in a rocket attack while out on patrol, miraculously survived unscathed while everyone else died, and oh yeah it was his birthday too. In reality, he was a desk jockey.

SO I ignored them and this pissed them off, so the one starts sitting next to me and touching me and such but in a shitty way, no like sexual assault, but like touching me and being like ""ew your so fucking ugly"" and all this shit. SO I finally break and I just push her over. Next thing I know my own friends are all over me about ""assaulting"" her. They watched her and her friend treat me like shit but didn't do anything because they wanted to hook up with them. I've had something like this happen at most parties I go to. When your the only red head, someone usually takes the time to mess with you. I don't understand why so many people have such a problem with red hair. it's so fucking petty."
"People who make it a point to take dozens of photos literally any second they're with friends.  Drinking randomly with a few guys?

Hell yah, make sure to blare your shitty music, and slowly pan over the whole 2 people awkwardly sitting in the back on their phones to post on your story.   It comes off as extremely cringy and insecure. The idea that you have to make sure people know you're out doing stuff with friends is repluslive. Trust me, no one is jealous of you and your bros playing with the kids bikes at Walmart."

"I used to have a couple roommates who did this. The first one always bragged about how he was great at video games, driving, cooking, anything really.  He turned into a violent POS after he realized I wasn't really believing all his and didn't care.  His friend became my next roommate, along with his fiancee. This one pretty much said all the same stuff and even tried to one up me about SAT scores even though I never said my score. He just looked me dead in the eye saying he got a 2200. I didn't care about the score as much as I did the creepy look. And it sucked cause things he tried to one up people at, he wasn't actually good at.  From experience, people like this seem to also lie again and again, even when they don't have to. And they always seem like violent assholes if you don't care about what they're saving. Sure, not all people who one up are, but a damn good chunk are assholes unhappy with themselves and their lives."

"In some of the most insecure girls I know it's being heavy into beauty regimens and always being sure they have make up on, hair done, look beautiful, and dress to their body. I mean, I've noticed this with the girls who don't let their man have a celebrity crush, masturbate, or watch porn. Girls who don't let their guys do those types of things are afraid of losing their man to something fictional, and I just noticed these girls happened to have that same hot/beautiful type of look. It's actually like that with MOST of the typical ""hot girl"" types I know personally. So guys, if she's lookin' hot and always lookin' hot, they maybe using their hotness/beauty to cover up their insecurities."

"No perception of reality is ever going to match actual reality. Not all people are nice, and not all people are judgemental.  The truth is somewhere in between. The point of the sayjng is just to illustrate that what you experience is based off of internal views of reality.  For example, if you did not have the notion that people are judgemental or the notion that you were ugly (I think you are probably not ugly) then somebody taking a picture of you would have registered under something else in your mind. Perhaps if you believed you were attractive, you would think they were being creepy stalkers.  What you experience is based on what is inside. The catch is since everything you experience is always based on your internalized beliefs, your perceived reality will never actually match up with actual reality.  So you could take this to mean a couple of things. A) you could focus very hard to get rid of faulty inner beliefs and meditate and bla bla bla, learn to see the world as it is  This is one of the things Buddhists do (and specifically Zen buddhism, afaik).  However, it's of my unprofessional opinion that this is wishful thinking. I think that B) the only thing left to do is embrace that you will always experience a faulty impression of reality. It is liberating, because you literally get to decide what your reality gets warped into. And you do this by your internalized beliefs about yourself and the world.  Of course this is all easier said than done, people with PTSD or social anxiety might scoff at this stuff and they are right to. But it's just food for thought, really.   Tldr: you're right, people are judgemental."

"Start taking stands for what you believe in, even if you're scared.   If someone does something you don't like, you call them out on it.  If you hear something bad about a person you like, you take a stand for them.   If you don't want to do something, say no and stand your ground.   If you say no, but then you are convinced to do something, that isn't insecurity, but if you're no longer comfortable, leave.   If you don't want to lend money/something, just don't, you don't owe anyone anything.   Tldr; stand up for yourself and don't let people walk over you.  Edit: just going to add, pick sides when you're arguing with other people and voice your opinions."

Putting other people down.
I had an ex that did something like this once.
A lot of people have said this but i also agree in the one-upness/always competitive thing.  I't's like they have to be good at everything and constantly have to prove themselves in their group of people.Like honestly It's tiresome to be competitive about everything you can and i don't how they manage to do it.  But everything has a cause.Maybe it's their personality maybe they have experienced embarrassment for something they couldn't do well and now it's like a defense mechanism.    Basically i would say It's not 100% their fault.In a normal group of friends/people there is definitely competition but there is also uniqueness.Everyone does one thing and they do it well.And they combine their skills for a common goal.
Putting others down constantly.

"If it ramped up from phone snatching, then you may be in an abusive relationship. Many people in abusive relationships don't realize they are in one for years, or after separation.   [Signs of Abuse](https://www.healthline.com/health/signs-of-mental-abuse#humiliation-negating-and-criticizing)  Not all of the signs have to be there. My ex was abusive, but it was covert. She would not use ""bad words"" like calling me a fuck up or whatever, but would constantly belittle me and was very condescending and contemptuous. She was also never physically violent with me, but our relationship didn't escalate to that point.   Abuse tends to get worse over time. Your partner will seem perfect at first and for a few months after getting together before you start seeing red flags. Over the next year or two you think ""that's just the way she is"" and you love her good qualities. After a few years, most abusers will escalate and their partners will begin to realize the abusive pattern for what it is."

"That's an interesting way to test someone.   I do believe that being an asshole (in the eyes of people under you) doesn't necessarily mean you're abusing your power. In some cases it is, but in our company there is a manager who some (the people under him) may consider an asshole, however, they think hes an asshole because he keeps them busy and really pushes them to do their best. I realize that your typical employee wants to do as little as possible and this manage doesn't allow that. He actually states if my employees think I'm an asshole, it means im doing something right.   So my question for you would be, do you evaluate and monitor them personally? Or do you go off what the employees under them have to say? I'm just asking out of curiosity and I try not to acknowledge feedback without reasoning. Simply put ""hes an asshole"" isn't enough for me to judge a manager."

Secondly, I feel as if the special part of having your own kid is that there is extra responsibility on you for that kid because you deliberately brought them into the world. Thirdly, with your own kid you have a blank slate in terms of mentoring them on the world around them and if they are receptive you can warn them of your own mistakes. A kid even as young as like 7 or 10 might already have a lot of set ideas about things especially if a kid was adopted and had a crappy foster situation/was a victim of parental abuse.  I'm a person very option to adoption so on a more fundamental level I'm more with you than not, but I wouldn't go far as to say there isn't something special or unique about having a biological kid over a nonbiological. Hell, I think both scenarios can develop equally awesome relationships though they will be of a different nature."
Was waiting to see this response.  I always wanted to spray paint them blue.
"""Oh, why do they call you that?""  ""...because I accidentally shot a kid about 20 years ago. I was charge for Involuntary Manslaughter, to which I pleaded guilty and spent 15 years in a state penitentiary. After I got out, I joined an Alcoholics Anonymous support group, quit drinking and gave up all my guns. That said, every night since that day, I've woken up in a  cold sweat reliving that moment. You never forget those blood curdling screams as they slowly quiet down, especially knowing they were caused by your hands."""

Welcome to reddit then. It’s everyone’s talent here
Not inviting your atheist friends to your wedding ceremony?
"People who use terms like, ""bud,"" ""snowflake,"" or someone's age or generation in an insulting manner."
my brain
"A buddy of mine, his roommate can't fucking help himself. Every single conversation no matter what it's about or how casual it may be, he has to jump in with ""I can top that""."
I keep waiting for this social support and understanding and it just never seems to happen.   Maybe my vagina’s on the fritz.
Nearly every PhD candidate I knew started straight out of undergrad but I will concede it does vary by discipline.
"I try to give people the benefit of the doubt or just not to give too many fucks about other people. It makes life so much easier. Like my dad will spend 20 minutes bitching and moaning about the homeless he saw on the way to work, just accusing this dude of being a drug addict or a criminal or an illegal immigrant. Like why go through that much effort? I would much rather spend that 20 minutes getting my work done and just listening to music or a podcast while being content"
Promiscuity
I do.
I do.
Super expensive cars or very lifted trucks.
Since I don’t see it posted yet... dating profiles with only face pictures. And/or the first picture being a group and you just KNOW they’re the ugly one
"Jealousy. It's a very selfish emotion that, if you're not insecure, you won't feel. Especially in relationships"
Constantly putting others down to make yourself look better by comparison.
Oh yeah well my school is full of people who don’t even sleep at all so
Being shy
"Fair enough, and I appreciate your time! I try to be supportive To my friends, who sometimes come to me to talk over their situations and get advice.  There are a few people who keep making the same bad decisions, refuse to reverse course, etc.  And like you said, their relationships are theirs, but I’m not going to be sympathetic or willing to listen to them complain about their refusal to get out of their own way, you know?  I’m cool with people making their own mistakes, even repeatedly. But I don’t care to listen to you complain about the consequences.   A few of my friends have chafed at that boundary."
"Constantly looking for signs of insecurity in other people. For example, posting this question to ask Reddit every other week, clicking on it when you see it, upvoting things you recognize."
Truck Nuts
"I guess this conversation could be completely fine if it wasn't for voice tone and context, so I get it why you could have interpreted it differently"
"Every time they post a picture of themselves or someone else posts a picture and tags them in it, they comment something like ""I look horrible in this lol"" or ""my face eww"""
"Someone screaming ""I'm very insecure"""
Being covered with tattoos
Acting very arrogant
"Head out to Bakersfield, CA. Lots of people out there do this kind of shit to their trucks."
"I work behind a bar on campus at uni, and at my uni, there’s a Facebook page made for like.. confessions and gossip and the like. There was a post made about me (I was a new guy and was telling the guy this, and his description was 100% me) that went along the lines of “Tell me you’re straight so I can move on”. So, a couple of my friends tagged me in it to say “Omg it’s you!”  My girlfriend saw them tag me in it and got really upset when she came up to visit the following week and it took over a month for her to realise it was just a nice compliment for me and I wasn’t going to cheat on her :/"
Does...does she think they're *her* friends?

"I did started doing this in 5th grade when we moved to a different town. At first it was to fit in, but it became uncontrollable and continued well into high school. Proud I was able to change and if anything I’m too modest now."
Pretending to be in an economic bracket that you seriously cannot afford or ever be in.
"Is that what you call it?  Edit: Chill nerds, its a direct quote"
Yeah it kind of seems like this could just be a conversation starter into a normal discussion about how kids develop differently and personal experiences with it.

"I moved to where I am now in late spring. I noticed there seemed to be a ton of drama around a couple of people and I initially had sympathy. Within a couple of months, I began to pick up on behaviours they have. Now I'm being kicked out at the end of this month because I was very blunt with the fact that they are creating all of their own problems after they started trying to drag me down with them. But I finally got most of the drama out of my life, and I'm not letting any more come in on my watch."

"My parent's neighbor is a mid 30's dude who walks around with a gun on his hip at all times. Last week I overheard him warning a Chihuahua that he *""gets one shot""* and to make it count. Presumably the miniature dog was making eyes at him."
"People who need to point out every little thing you do, no matter if it concerns them or not."
&gt; the best walker there is!  This should be on a Tinder profile
Posting super vague things on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter  Like    Feeling so lonely right now    You make me so confused   He isn't worth it   And when someone asks it's like: I'll DM you

"I dont know, maybe going on r/MGTOW?  Your history’s showing."
"Omg this is horrible. I don’t have any kids, but I’ll adopt that little girl and let her wear pants and get dirty and play with any toy she wants whether it’s Barbie or GI Joe, LEGO or Goldie Blocks. Let that child be a child, ffs!"
Winnie the pooh is not banned in china tho.. why people keep believing this?

"Reposting every happy birthday shout out that you get on Instagram, that way everyone gets to see it twice instead of just once."
"People that are always trying to crack jokes and make people laugh are generally insecure, not always in a bad way though."
Acting like those internet points/badges mean anything.  I always hate when top forum user belittle newbie.   It's like they want their community to die.

We snuggle, watch TV shows together, and she helps me cook.  I'm just more interested in ""kid"" activities than ""toddler"" ones.  I think everyone has a favorite stage.  This one just isn't mine.    I think a lot of it is because I want to share my life with her.  Talk to her about my favorite meals, share what I want to do with my life (I'm an artist), and help her find what she wants to do with hers.    I'm also only 24 years old.  I'm learning to let go of my youth for her.  It is hard when you had a lot that you wanted to do with your life.  I've had to let go of so much of who I am.  Admittedly I haven't handled that in the best way.  I would love to be traveling, connecting with friends (only person in my friend group with a baby), and going to school.  It's hard to let that go for someone.  I'm doing my best."

"Breast implants, penis enlargements, basically any cosmetic surgery just SCREAMS insecurity, and dont get me started on makeup. If you’re going to wear makeup everywhere, have look somewhat natural, otherwise you’re just ‘that person’ in public"
"This is actually something I hate. I deal with it on the reverse side though. My son is 3 years old and is just now starting to speak. Hes autistic and has a speech delay. I'm not really insecure about it because it's just one of those things that can't be helped. All the time people will tell him to say something and he doesn't. He just makes some kind of sound and they're like ""why isn't he saying the word?"" Because he's autistic. He has a speech delay ""oh well he looks normal. My kid started talking when they were 10 months"". Well lady good for your kid. I didn't ask so why mention it? Because it just seems like you're trying to compete now"
Those people who go to top unis and wear their uni logos everywhere.
i hung around 3 people who did this to me constantly at school for four years. FOUR. i felt so tired of feeling like i was unworthy of praise and support and i wasn’t as good as them that i just cut them off a a few months ago. freedom is bliss
Lol I am literally reading this hoping that there isn’t something I do in here.
"Fishing for compliments is definitely an insecurity, but it can also stem from being a perfectionist and expecting too much out of yourself. In my experience, I don't even notice sometimes when it comes off as an insecurity because in my mind I just have too high expectations. If you're okay with them agreeing with you I'd say it's not."
"Wow are you me? I always thought I wasn't good enough and would never amount to anything, there was no reason for anyone to be my friend. I would always deny or brush off compliments. Someone pointed out to me once that it made them feel bad because I wouldn't ever believe there was anything good about myself. People had stopped giving me any compliment because of my reactions. I had to force myself to just say thank you, starting with compliments on my flute performing, even if I didn't believe it and eventually I started really believing it and those types of interactions are much more pleasant now."
Girls that probably arent that insecure
Guys with huge pick up trucks that have very bright headlights who get one centimeter from your bumper at a red light for no reason.
It's the pairing of the truck and aggressive driving that does it.
Tell the damn truth. Like all the time. The only exceptions you make to that are if you are legitimately trying to be supportive of someone who needs it where telling the truth will ruin them.
Good that you can think.  Bravo
Picking on people in specific ways
That guy who holds his girlfriend by the back of the neck in public. I cringe just looking at it.

"The real world will care more about someone who’s got a strong work ethic and knows how to get along with everyone, instead of someone with a super strong work ethic. Who you know matters a lot more than what you know after all."
Putting your hands in pocket
"This was my ex-boyfriend. We were best friends before we dated and there were these really important college entrance exams coming up. He and I were considerably smart, and you had to have a certain “board exam” percentage of marks to be eligible to apply to colleges, which he didn’t get, although you have a good entrance score. So, as it got closer, he kept bragging more and more about his parents’ wealth. Every time the discussion came up, he’d say “I don’t have to worry though because I’m well off anyway” and it pissed me off because that really wasn’t the man I was in love with."

Sometimes I do. But not often.
"Talking smack about people behind their back instead of offering constructive criticism upfront. Trash-talking people who clearly are talented in their field; who've earned their knowledge, skill, and fortune by putting in the work, effort, and diligent practice. Bragging about yourself a lot (frankly a survival mechanism for people who are drowning in a sea of desperation, which is alright, but also revealing self-esteem issues that likely comes from a lack of proper guidance from caregivers.) Being mean and overly callous in general."

Screaming “I’m very insecure”
My entire life was a lie from middle school to my junior year of high school. I moved to a new town to start middle school and took the opportunity to completely change who I was. By lying of course. My living situation was awful and I got the shit kicked out of me every single day. So when I was at school I'd lie about who I was in an attempt to give myself some confidence. I regret doing it for as long as I did. Everyone saw right through it. But thankfully some of the people that saw right through it decided to be my friend. If it wasn't for them I never would have embraced who I actually am.   I dont know where I'd be right now without the people that saw through my bullshit and wanted to be my friends anyway.
"Ironically, not literally screaming ""I'm very insecure""!   That takes a certain amount of security."

My response was ""oh I would never let someone tell me how to dress or who to hang out with"".  I have been with the same guy for nearly 20 years and they still think it's weird that I do my own thing and don't ask him permission. Fuck that nonsense."

Calling others “racist.”  Most of the time people doing this nowadays are just projecting / overcompensating for their own racist feelings - or they are just losers and the best thing they have going for them is “at least I’m not a racist.”

Basically. There’s a reason I don’t do FB anymore. I know some people who literally live their lives through social media.

"I'm away from my friends and family right now. Posting sure is seeking attention/connection, and I'm doing a lot of it right now. But it's due to loneliness and not really knowing where else to find that connection with other people.  Yeah, perhaps it is attention seeking, but they're are plenty of people who don't have many friends or people to share their lives with. Loneliness is tough. Its likely that many of those people don't have self inflated egos and want everyone to pay attention to them - they are just looking for human interaction and don't know how else to get it."

"I used to teach Chinese International Students. In general they all came from the upper crust, but some of them brought spoiled to a new level. They talked down to teachers, laughed when they were told to do things, and then often threw epic tantrums and begged to stay when they were kicked out of the school. (Only to go back to their old ways when mommy and daddy sent them to a new school, for the cycle to repeat)  I had a student who was an absolute pleasure. Hard working, kind, compassionate, wise beyond his years. One day he said this about his fellow wealthy students: ""I feel bad for them because I know what it feels like to act like that. You feel powerful and in control, but underneath it all you actually feel really weak and scared. I had to learn that even though it was scary to me, it was much better and more peaceful to be humble.""  He was one of the happiest and put together students I've ever had."

Ok..I get why people don't understand why opposite sex acquaintances or friends should not be alone together when they are not with their significant other but in retrospect of my life there were 2 and could have been 3 ways that this DID and could have gone wrong on the 3rd... We are human 1st and foremost...and in weak self loathing times we revert to what feels good now. Be it drugs or alcohol or relationships (its like a drug) that we THINK that we can handle... As you spend time with opposite sex friends/acquaintances you develop a bond...you find out about their sadness...their weakness...their joy. Strangely enough its like dating...there is and can be attraction. Even if one of them is not very good looking this time alone can be very dangerous...most of us don't have the strength to resist and even if you do in a lot of cases that resolve breaks down.  If it happens to be in a weak time in your marriage or your current love life we find ways to justify our actions...its human nature.  It happend when my current wife of 25 years before we were involved we spent time driving to work as I was her stepsons best friend...she (my current wife) was married at the time but very lonely...I was 18 and she was 25. We cleaned a fastfood joint after they closed and became close as the drive took 20 minutes each way. We would talk about everything and before you know it we are having sex in her house. We had an affair while she was married for a year or so before we confessed and tried to end our relationship...she told her husband because we knew it was wrong and she tried to go back. There was abuse from her 1st husband but for the sake of the kids she tried to go back. It didn't work with him so we ended up making a go of it and have been married for 25 years since... The other instance was in this marriage of mine with her I seriously neglected her and and probably wanted our marriage to end because I was so young when we married (21) and I felt that I wanted to see what else was out there...so stupidly I acted as if we were not really married...just going through the motions of marriage thinking that we were ok but knowing that everything was a big sham....we weren't even having sex..not from her side as she had/has a very high sex drive and would do it every night if I wanted....so she became friends with a man 10 years her senior of 60 years of age...they mostly spoke online (Facebook or Facetime) and I had no clue...till one day I got suspicious and decided to pay attention. I looked at our cell phone bill and found that she had been talking on the phone to this guy practically every moment that we were not at home together or when I was gone playing sports and things...  There were hours upon hours of time that I found in that bill that I knew without proof that she was probably cheating on me (rightfully so as I neglected her for years) But I always thought even though we were not happy that she would never to that to me...partly because I had never cheated on her even though we were both not happy...for years I didn't cheat with a person but I was cheating with my time...giving it to others or selfish interests....and it came about that she was cheating with this person that I had had in my home and they had become close from spending time together... So I speak from experience...One I was a persons affair and  one I was the other person that was cheated on...  And the 3rd was  in the middle of my wife and I trying to see if we were going to make it after the affair my very good friend allowed me to stay with him and his wife and kid in their home for 4 months as we worked to try to mend our marriage....in that time my friend had a job that required him to travel a fair amount which left me alone with his wife on many occasions...fortunately for me I was committed to making my wrecked marriage work but it could have very easily gone the other way... His wife and I talked alone and I could tell that this could go very badly if I didn't notice the signs and keep myself at a distance from becoming too close to his wife....I valued my friendship with my guy friend even in my weakened state and did it the right way but I can't say that there wasn't temptation.   The point is that it is not wrong to be too safe when thinking how to handle these types of situations...please don't be too quick to judge when people try to guard what they have...it doesn't necessarily mean that they have trust issues. It can just mean that if you remove as much temptation in front of you as you can then it will be easier to resist and not be human and possibly stumble.   My friend trusted me and his wife and it worked well but in many cases the temptation is just too great. I have great love for my friend because he did what I couldn't when I was young. And if he didn't I would not have been able to make it work with my wife as he let me stay there in his home.

Asking someone who they’re talking to/texting
"It's called toxic positivity, these people post that ""good vibes only"" memes because they have unhealthy levels of optimism and positive self-image.  They ""hate drama"" and ""hate negativity"" because they don't actually know how to confront things that should be confronted.  It's easier to say, I'm great and everyone can just go fuck themselves, than it is to self reflect, or resolve conflict with others.  People do this on social media thinking that people look up to it, when in reality, no one even likes it.  It has the opposite effect and causes people to just avoid you.  As for the meme about talking behind people's backs.... guess what sunshine, everyone talks behind people's backs.  Everyone.  If you say you don't talk behind someone's back, you're probably a liar.  Sometimes, what's said behind your back gives some clear insight as to how people view you and what you should work on.  Shit like ""she's ugly, she's just jealous, her boobs are totally fake, her boyfriend is stupid"" sure, okay, fuck those people, that's just nonsense you can't even take personally anyway.  But when people talk behind your back and say you are abrasive, you are hurtful, you do this or that... perhaps take that shit into consideration.  Toxic positivity says ""fuck the haters, I'm going to post a meme on Facebook about #haters"" but a reasonable, logical, self aware person says ""maybe I need to think about how I treat people.""  This sort of attitude may seem like vapid Facebook/Instagram crap, but it's actually a mentality that will seep into all areas of life.  If you can't take feedback, how will you succeed in a job?  How will you be able to resolve conflict with friends, boyfriends/girlfriends, your spouse?  How will you achieve a goal and set reasonable expectations?  How will you confront situations, like stress, or mounting debt?   You can't, if you're the type to just revert to sunshine and rainbows."

I have nothing to do with reviewing him (ok, our joint manager gets pissed when I spend too much time listening to his BS). We’re somewhat peers.  Dude, we’re supposed to be covering this together - if I’m spending time showing you how to do things it’s because I want you to succeed, to do more, to get more credit, to grow into your role. If you’re getting overwhelmed, just give me a shout:  while I have my own shit to do, we’re supposed to be backing each other up."

Anyway, parents always give the, ""I'm not that kind of parent but my kids a dance prodigy so they belong in ___ level."" They don't like when I explain their placement isn't going to change because the kid would definitely be overwhelmed in the next level up, or, I don't know, *seriously injure themselves because they skipped a level and didn't learn the techniques correctly.*   First off, lady, you ARE being *that* parent.

Not too long after that, said girlfriend gets a new car (brand new as well, I think). Now I don't know all of the details of their budget and the necessity of a new vehicle, but that decision didn't make sense to me because she has poor credit, a kid to take care of with my brother (who also has a brand new truck), and no substantial marketable skills that I'm aware of. I can't decide if she got jealous or just wanted a nice vehicle for herself.  I've been tempted to buy nice things just to see what would happen."

There was a kid on my soccer team that would constantly try to strick conversation with everyone no matter what they were doing and would only talk about himself. After a while most people stopped talking to him because they were obvious lies. One day he started talking to me so I related to what he was saying so i told him my own perspective on the situation (i forgot what the topic of the conversation was) and he just completely interrupted me to switch the topic so that he could talk about him again.  To me this screams insecure  Ps if you would joke around with him like a normal sports team. he would bring up how suicidal he was and how he thought about “committing”

He said you weren't talking about kids? I said we did talk about kids because I have three and she has a couple that was it, do we have a problem? She told him what our conversation was obviously, then we have a stare down, then he closes the door, opens it ten seconds later, another stare down, then he closes it.

"That's the thing though, I don't think I'm ugly lol. The reason I figured they thought I was ugly was because I'm not famous, and they were laughing as they took the video. I just said ugly, but I just meant they were clearly making fun of my appearance somehow, whether it be my hair, body, or clothes. There's only so many reasons to laugh at somebody while you take a video.   I definitely see where you're coming from with the meditation and internal self angle, but some things that you experience are based on outside factors, not inside ones. I might have believed they were creepy stalkers if their faces had shown something like admiration or obsession instead of mockery. But if somebody tells you they don't like you, that doesn't come from inside you, and facial expressions are a form of body language."

"Your personal experience is not remotely justification for anybody else to agree with your conclusion, even tentatively.   We do not know if you have misinterpreted what you saw, whether your own biases are leading you to circle the hits and ignore the misses, whether you have actually enumerated the possiblities or even whether you are suffering from a poor mental state yourself.  You are making an argument from ignorance, that you can see no other way that low or high self esteem can unfold, so you've made your conclusion before you actually have the information necessary.

"My mom is kind of like this. She judges everyone and everything, and complains a lot, especially when things dont go her way. I used to be very judgy, and I've worked hard to correct that behavior.   She's exhausting to be around. She was complaining at my sister's wedding (her stepdaughter and technically my stepsister) that the reception was too long. Planning when she could leave etc. Like dont get me wrong, stuff like that can be boring, but you just have to suck it up and do it.   She also sent me some money on an app. Her and my stepdad both did. I mentioned I hadnt gotten hers yet (she owed me money for something I bought). She went off saying ""yeah I sent it and both Jack (my stepdad) and I never heard anything from you. Thats rude and we are upset."" I said ""well thats a lie, I got his, and texted him thank you right after when i got his"". She just laughed and said ""oh yeah maybe he didnt say that"". Turns out hers hadnt sent. Holy shit stop lying.  Sorry for the rant. I just spent a weekend with her, and I love her, but from afar."

"As someone’s who’s much taller than average it would probably amaze most how many short guys try and start fights with taller guys, especially at bars. For example last week I was watching a football game intensely for an hour and someone behind me tapped me on the shoulder extremely hard. I turn around and a short guy is in my face demanding I don’t look at his girlfriend. I say “im not” he says “you better fucking not”. I have dozens of interactions like this. Manlet rage is real"

"I don't always think that is a sign of insecurity, just a poor way to relate to the person they are talking to. You tell a story about how when you were at X, then Y happened, and they are like, *""I know what you are saying, when I went there, Y happened twice. I believe you and can relate!""*  Other people, like my son who legit really good at just about everything, in his immaturity, likes to spoil someone else's sense of achievement.  Like yesterday, my daughter was telling me she ran the mile Friday in 6 min 30 seconds, which is a huge accomplishment, because this summer her fastest time was 8min. My son, without raising an eyebrow and in a monotone voice said, well I ran a mile in 4min 15 seconds yesterday morning with Dad. He does this all the time because he is immature and really doesn't understand that maybe he has a little gifting. He thinks, I did it, you should be able to too. Immaturity =/= Insecurity."

Objectively someone who goes out of their way to go ""We're just making fun of people because they denigrate people for not being smart"" is no better than someone who picks on people for not being smart. It's not a ""Mom he started it!"" Contest. You're both being twats for the sake of it  Oh and I'm going to go out on a limb and say the person who's been on reddit for 7 years,  and still is on largely through the day, I probably hit the nail on about being insecure Lmao, go play some apex and waste your life some more"

"WTF, my mom has paranoid schizophrenia and she drilled her paranoia and hatred for the world in me since I was a child. She convinced me anytime I would be outside someone would kidnap me, so I was almost never allowed to leave home. She still thinks people want to put sleeping pills in my food. She was also extremely abusive, maybe because of her extreme insecurity.  Just trying to remove that fear of outside world from my head is so hard. I wouldn't wish that illness on even my worst enemy."

"Irony of all ironies: a lot of young children’s developmental milestones are mostly bullshit. If the standard timeframe for a child to do something is like a 3-6 month period, then them doing it early is nothing to brag about. For example, babies will walk between 9 and 15 months. That period of time is almost half their life. So in the baby’s grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter. Meanwhile, there’s actually a ton of benefits for babies crawling and doing so for a longer period of time."

"Acting like whatever they like is super unique and obscure.  My old coworker had a boyfriend who was insecurity incarnate. One time I was hanging out at her house and he was playing music. “Season of the Witch” by Donovan came on and he smugly bet that none of us had ever heard this song before.  Dude, _Lana Del Rey covered this song._  It is not obscure.

"This is my brother in law!  Everything we talk about, big or small, he HAS to one-up us.  If he's not doing better than us, he'll try to end up lecturing us on anything so he seems more knowledgeable. I know he gets all his info from YouTube. Once he told us how the world is really flat.  If he's not lecturing us, he's trying to tell us how we're doing something wrong and he's doing it right. Mostly it has to do with food.  I offered him ice cream when he visited and he went on a rant how we probably eat unhealthy cheap ice cream and how he can only eat ice cream with actual ingredients. He walked over to my fridge and grabbed my Haagen Daaz pint and proceeded to read the ingredients out loud. ""Milk, cream, strawberries...."" yeah he shut up after that.  I still remember, the night I told him my dad had pancreatic cancer, he decided it was a great time to lecture me that it's because of what my dad ate that he got cancer. He said that he shouldn't eat fast food. Growing up, we RARELY (and I mean RARELY) ate fast food, not even mac&amp;cheese from the box. I told him that and my BIL said ""it's because in your culture, you guys probably add preservatives and nothing is organic"". Yeah, I cried that night because I couldn't believe how stupid he was.  So I run a business, it's been successful for 8 years now. He likes to come in and try to give me tips that don't make sense. Last time, I was doing my quarterly taxes; he tells me how I need to be deducting stuff like my food and stuff not related to the business. This is coming from a guy that has never filed his taxes because according to him, ""taxes aren't a law. Where in the law book says I need to file my taxes?"""
People who constantly put others down to make them feel bigger.
"Many years ago...  There was this guy in my typing class in high school who told me that he was once some sort of high level spy type of guy.  Mind your we're in HS.  He goes on to say something about him getting into some trouble with the Japanese Yakuza and that's why he had to get out of the spy thing.  So whatever he's done to piss off said Yakuza escalates into a full on chase through our town on a motorcycle that he's stolen from someone I can't remember, but it's a super fast crotch rocket (by his account).  So the chase goes on for longer than I can believe I was able to listen to with a straight face, and ends when he arrives at the top of a popular big hill in our town.  At the top of this hill, police cars are assembled in a road block formation.  I can't remember how or by what means he was able to become airborne, but he said that he jumped the cop cars and out ran the Yakuza in one swift motion.    What the fuck are you supposed to say to someone when they tell you something like that?  He was dead serious.  I think I said something like ""wow,.... uh... that's crazy.... jeesh....whoa"" and then just kept typing.   The guy did some serious crap in our town and a few years down the line he committed suicide.  He would have been a cool smart person if he wasn't always trying to prove something.  It's a shame."
"As a high school teacher I have seen the effects of Tumblr and ""Tumblr diagnosed"" mental illnesses on kids. Basically the kids with the real issues are getting therapy through school or parents' insurance and trying to get better while the Tumblr-ites just use their alleged diagnosis to get stuff, victim points or out of work or attention. I had a girl claim to have PTSD without a doctor's note and use it to bring a non-certified 'service' dog (ie, emotional support animal, it did no actual service for her) into the school building. I had to jump through hoops to get her moved to another room because I had a number of students who were severely allergic to dogs. But then there's the girl whose mom's boyfriend was raping her and I couldn't even get someone to do a wellness check without calling the cops. I had to beg her guidance counselor to get her help. Both white girls, one obsessed with Tumblr and social media, and the other just trying to survive."
"But it's not the definitive sign of cheating. My ex started cheating on me, and just stopped interacting with me even though we lived together.   She was once listening to music with headphones, and then I woke up, went into the living room. She sees me, screams in anger, throws her headphones down, and yells ""WELL THE DAY IS OVER NOW!!!""   She then made it clear that she's unhappy when I'm around/awake."

"My ex confessed that she had tracked and followed my roommate in her car, who was her bf. Then she asked me if he was cheating and was very offended when I told him she asked. Then my roommate got her pregnant but denied the child was his, claiming she was cheating with her ex 'Zach' and it was his kid. She had an abortion, but told me it was a miscarriage.  I moved out from my roommate (er bf), he broke up with her (for cheating), 9 months later she texted me and 6 months later she left 'Zach' to move with me to Vegas. Please understand, this story only makes sense (???) because neither of us are crack whores, we are educated adults with decent childhoods who should be expected to not do this type of shit.  She goes through all my texts and emails and announces that I'm not a guy who will cheat or rape, that I'm a 'good guy' as if she's never seen one before. She starts IMing all night long claiming to me it is her bff Dixie. When I come home to find bruises on her ass in the exact shape of handprints, she claims she was drugged and raped at work, but doesn't want me to pursue it or ask her to report it.  Later, I find on Facebook that 'Zach' planned a trip to Vegas months earlier where he was in town the exact weekend she was 'drugged and raped'. Then she flies home to see her parents, not 'Zach'. At this point I realize she is cheating on me, just like she cheated on Zach and my roommate. Since it is my own computer and I'm already 99% sure she is cheating, I install keylogger software.  The moment she gets back, she IM's Zach to tell him how much she misses him and dreams of him and his kisses and his cock in her. I ask her about her trip, she tells me she never saw Zach. Please realize that at this point, she could be on Reddit telling a story of how an insane boyfriend illegally and unnecessarily monitored her internet chats and invaded her privacy through his jealous outrage.  The keylogger software popped up while she was typing him late at night to ask for an update or some shit. She saw it and pulled me out of bed, demanding to know what and why this software was on my computer, bawling about 'how I didn't trust her'...."

"I had a friend that did this, but it was about me. Whenever he would be with a girl he would always make sure to tell them about me losing a lot of weight as if he was the reason I did it. Made no sense and was very awkward."
"Persistent SMDA. Dude, we get that you have a boyfriend/girlfriend. We’re happy for you, but how often must you remind the world that you’re in a relationship? It annoys me to NO BOUND when I see 10-15 couply pictures on someone’s story.  Also the “glass toasting boomerang.” Or anyone who constantly posts about how much they’re drinking - no it is not cool to slam back a handle of Bacardi every other night."
"Posting multiple nearly identical selfies a day, and getting all ""ugh, I'm soooooooo ugly"". For whatever underlying reason, they are begging for love/validation through likes."
"People who resort to violence and threats for every situation. Whether its losing a video game or just someone sneezing loudly, there will be a douchebag who has to threaten to kick someone's ass. Definitely shows how fragile their self esteem is when they only self worth is based on physical strength  (While it's mainly dudes you see, I've also seen my fair share of overly violent females as well)"
"Driving a diesel truck when all you ever do is tow a small trailer or boat a couple times a year, but you just use it to harass other drivers on the road the other 99% of the time."
That’s all you needed to say. This no longer seems that weird.
"Damn now that you mention it i do this a lot, i even lied to my therapist when i had one to seem like i was going through more stuff than i actually was and then to seem like i was cooperating and moving forward more than i actually was. Damn idk what to do at this point"
The fact that you’re even aware makes you cooler than most

"&gt;Wrong. She’s just a cunt to women. Self-fulfilling prophecy at its finest.  Or she has realized that flirting can get her far, but it doesn't work on women."
"Jumping in here -   I'd say that broadly, hating on people in general indicates insecurity, but hating on a specific group of people that current society tells you it's okay to hate (like ""rednecks"") is likely an additional level of insecurity (and cowardice)."
"Eh, I'm overly nice becuase it feels good. I work a customer service job and I excel becuase it genuinely brings me happiness to help other people.   I have opinions, but I'll settle for whatever if I need to. Like if I'm in the mood for thai food, and everyone else is wanting pizza or something, I just wont speak up. I like pizza and I dont really want to make people feel bad about not wanting thai. Do I want to cut the grass or stack firewood? I dont really care, they both kind of suck but they both need done. I'll do whatever you want to do least."

Everything about me
me.
"-Being overly controlling / manipulative.   -Constantly accusing others of wrongdoing.  -Saying things to make others feel guilty / bad.   -Assuming the worst in all scenarios.   -Refusing to accept feedback or becoming short / avoidant if something displeases you.   -Making one-off rude or petty comments that are inserted into a casual conversation   -Overanalyzing everything and jumping to conclusions (as in every single word someone says and finding one part of piece to flip the entire conversation)  -Being overly loud and confident or dominating  to a point that is uncomfortable for others  -Being like a plunger and constantly bringing up old shit.   Also, opposites can be true. Never speaking up - not going out - being avoidant - covering up (body parts) - believing anything anyone says etc.   I don’t know? &lt;—"
"I told colleagues where I worked once, saying I felt tired. They asked how much sleep I got? I said ""Oh about 8 hours"" tbh. They were all like 8 hours?! Including one who said ""Are you a baby?"" Most people over there apparently slept 5-6 hours.."

"That's so pathetic of her. And it really says a lot about her relationship, too, since she obviously can't expect her hubby to not have sex with literally anyone at any chance."
"Lol.... uhhhh. All my friends were sexually active in high school. We didn't brag (well, maybe the guys bragged among themselves), but it was a part of our relationships and from the discussions and questions we asked each other it was clear no one was faking."

"Jealousy. I've always felt that when people are jealous, they tend to act out or one-up whoever is making them insecure. They can also become possessive or the person(s) around them. It's almost as if they are displaying to show that they are worthy of their peers attention. (Ex. a girlfriend wrapping her arm around her boyfriend when another female is around or a friend talking poorly of another person in the friend group when they aren't there). Most of the time there is no rational reason to feel threatened, but insecurity drives them to act this way."
"The guy with the Shelby Raptor II that lives down the street from me (in the city) w trunk nuts &amp; the words ""FAT ASS"" on his rear bumper. Yes, this man works as a dishwasher &amp; takes the bus to work. Yes he parks in the street &amp; not his empty driveway"

These are designed for obtaining sympathy &amp; concerned questions. Often the OP will respond ""I'll pm you"" - So why hint at it in public?   It's just like passing notes in school cliques &amp; fake soap opera style drama. ""I've got a secret"" or ""I'm ***SO BRAVE*** to have to cope with all of this"".  Its really pathetic."

"Just last night I came across a Facebook profile where this lady (who has two children) is, in a literal sense, insane. I'm talking about believing that Microsoft put a chip in her brain, that her family was burned alive by the illuminati, that she really died 20 years ago and now she's just an alias sent from God, etc.   I can't imagine how those kids are living, and the situation is really sad all around.

To my friends, I paint myself as a comic because the only way they could want to be my friend is if I'm happy and funny, while the truth is I haven't been happy in years.

I notice my friend does this alot but I always tried to believe she was being honest because no one wants to have a friend thats rude 24/7 but the truth is she is actually fucking rude and its annoying and my dumbass would always agree w her. Like this one time we were walking to class and we passed by this girl and my friend told me she wasn't pretty and said she looked like a horse and giggled. I thought maybe she was just kidding around but its actually really mean to say that about someone.

Not standing for anything. Going with whatever crowd you're with at the moment.
"The essential ""tryhard"". Bragging about hard life experience, past or present, and how easy it was/is to make it through. Positive attention. Or lamenting over a fairly easy life experience, but making it seem impossible, looking for sympathy. Or people who tell stories about impossible situations they've been in, looking for an audience. It's all false. Any exaggerated personality. They talk loudest, move around a lot to animate whatever bullshit they're selling. These people go home by themselves at the end of the day, or are stuck in a loveless marriage, or their kids hate them. Nothing makes you more insecure than that."

People want loud bikes to attract attention and stroke their own egos. Not for safety. That's just an excuse they use to justify it that sort of sounds legit.  Non-scientific refutation, but since I can't find any scientific evidence *for* the claim either... well, I guess this will have to do.  https://www.autoevolution.com/news/most-common-motorcycle-myths-debunked-part-1-45969.html"

Learned this is psychology; When your walk past a mirror or any reflective surface with your friend and he/she looks into their reflection shows that they are insecure about their looks.

"People who feel the need to act ""alpha"" all the fucking time"
"Being absolutely certain that your position on a topic is the 'right' one, and being so utterly unwilling to view it from the other side that you'll shout down anyone who disagrees. These are the people who repeat buzz phrases from other people/the media at you rather than answer your question, and who are likely to say that they are sick of experts."
"It's not conclusive evidence, however, it's definitely a red flag IMO."
"Repeatedly telling your girlfriend she should get implants, and then getting upset when she says you should get testicle implants."
“Do you know who I am?!”  Even if you are someone important this always sounds cringing insecure.

"Yikes. I was this girl in high school. Sure, some girls were nasty to me no matter what I did, but I took that wayyy out of proportion and decided I was better than every girl ever because I wasn't a total jerk.  Spoiler alert: I was the jerk, they were mostly normal.  I'm so glad I found out that I kinda sucked and that I changed my ways. I'm still struggling to be friends with girls because my shitty attitude was partly due to fear, but honestly it's a lot easier living life knowing that girls are not my enemy."
"Especially one-upping people with personal tragedies, or just sharing personal tragedies unprevoked with people you aren't super close with. It's super fucking awkward for everyone involved, and I'm just gonna keep quiet or change the subject completely. Somehow doing this removes my capability to feel sympathy for others' trauma. Like, there's a fucking time and place, and work is never it."

People who are bad at responding; at my lowest I would stop responding  to phone/text/ims because I was so insecure; I would think that my response is uninteresting/unsatisfactory or would be stressed thinking I fucked something up.

"A lot of the people I've met that are like this are extremely confident. I think Reddit wants them to be insecure because they hate them. But being a dick bag by driving like an idiot in traffic doesn't mean you are insecure. It just means you are a selfish dick bag. Also, people do this in sports cars as well."
"I think that's a normal level of nice. Ive worked in the restaurant industry and of course you have to be nice to people, but if you dont have a backbone people can feel that real quick and they will walk all over you.

"This isn't really an insecurity thing. Sure some people might buy those types of things for attention, but personally I love loud cars. I don't own one cause I don't have the dough, but if I did, it would be because I want to have my own personal symphony every time I drive. It wouldn't be because I want to ""look cool."" That being said, there's a limit, people who constantly rev their  engines are likely seeking attention, bonus points if it's in a parking lot and not showing the vehicle to someone. Also, by reving, I mean at stop lights and what not, if someone ""revs"" their engine while on the move, it's probably cause they're down shifting and not just being an ass."

"This sadly describes my best friend. When you get past the bullshit she's an amazing person, but her younger brother was the ""favored child"" and she was the ""throw-away"" from elementary school onwards, so shes been begging for her parent's love and attention ever since in any way she can. It doesn't help that her family is stupid levels of loaded, and her mom just throws money and presents at her in place of actual love and affection..."

"This is kind of a difficult road for me to walk. I mean, many times when you're having a conversation people share similar experiences that they've had so as to build a common bond. But some people have had many more life experiences than others. And so just based on the law of averages, since they have so many more experiences, some of those experiences will probably be better than the best experiences that another person has. This is especially true if there's an age/rank difference.  When I was a director at a Scout camp, I basically had to stop trying to bring up similar experiences with young kids.  &gt;&gt; The other day we went to X which was a 50 mile drive!  &gt; Me: thinking that I've been there many times and have driven back and forth across the country multiple times, then just shutting up about it, smiling and nodding so that I don't one-up then too much.  I mean, because of my age, etc., I had to find other ways to build common ground because it was almost impossible to not one-up those kids."
Pick me’s. Thinking you’re better than other girls because you like things that aren’t conventionally feminine. Or shaming women for doing things like wearing crop tops or working out in sports bras or sleeping around. It just screams “I need male validation”. Who gives a hoot what other people choose to do. If it doesn’t concern you why are you getting so worked up about it and bringing other people down.

Oh shut the fuck up. Can you even provide one anecdotal example of an illegal immigrant taking a job from someone **you** know.
"The key is in most situations where you could hurt someone's feelings, to put yourself in their shoes and think ""would I appreciate knowing this?"" So, for me, if I've got something in my teeth, or the guy I'm dating is throwing up all kind of red flags and I'm too dickstruck to see it, yeah I absolutely would want to know.  If you don't like my haircut or my outfit, you can tell me you hate them IF I ASK, because if I ask, I genuinely want an honest opinion, but just volunteering a rude assessment of someone's appearance is pretty shitty.  If someone asks for your opinion, there's nothing wrong with being honest and you'll build a reputation as being someone your friends can rely on to tell it straight, which most people really value. And those that don't are exhausting to have to mollycoddle all the time anyway so don't worry about them!"

She slept with multiple men during the weekend and said I threw myself at men.   She would get blacked out drunk and say I was a raging alcoholic (even though I have a fear of throwing up so I never get more than a slight buzz going on).  She says I’m depressed (mainly because I’m introverted and like to be in on the weekends (though I do movie night and dinners with friends during the week)) though she complains about how much she hates how she feels (sick from alcohol and junk food) and how she hates when men call her a whore.  She’s argumentative on small topics due to her anger disorder so she says I’m a bully.   I told her to cut it out and called her out on every lie and suddenly our suite mate (who is a sweetheart) is a whore/alcoholic/bully.    I can’t wait for her to stand up to my roommate and someone else gets to be the victim of her lies."

When someone tells a story, only for you to try to tell a more exaggerated version of the story involving yourself.

(perhaps my greatest flaw)  and 3) getting angry when someone turns you down. (some of my more regretful things I've said have been in bruised male-ego retaliation, now I'm mature enough for it not to bother me)  All who do so are insecure and have problems with others making their own choices or doing something you haven't."

As an adult, I actually find myself having more girl friends than close guy friends, whereas by numbers it was the opposite during adolescence, but it was never skewed exclusively one way or the other. People are dynamic, complex, and unique.  That ""not like other girls"" attitude is really off putting. The ones I've personally encountered acted strangely towards me, instigating some kind of one sided pissing-contest over trying to 'out bro' me and acting out the vicious, catty girl stereotype behaviors they were all too vocal about rejecting cause ""I'm not like those *other girls*.

I wasnt in there for the attention. It took me several years to befriend girls because i just couldnt connect with them because they were only interested in stuff i didnt like at that time. Today i still have more male friends than female friends but the female ones are finally generous ones that share my hobbies so i guess sometimes it just depends where you grow up."

"Oml this post scared me. Ngl I'm pretty insecure. Not sure why but I feel like everyone lies when they say I look fine or compliment me. Every time someone compliments me I just don't accept compliments and feel super suspicious that the person wants something. But yeah. If you look up ""insecure"" you might find my photo.  Edit: this post for example. Very insecure"
I too understand this. Sorry if I’m bothering you.
That’s true.
"think of your life as a story. figure out your character alignment and the roles others play in your life. give yourself a theme. relish conflict as good debate opportunities to further your own character development. it helps me when i exist in the third person because being ""opinionated"" becomes somewhat of a game and not a personality haul over.   that said i think being a doormat is perfectly ok and there is a level of confidence to it that many dont take into account. people like meeting character tropes because the familiar is subconsciously more comforting and therefore appealing. ambiguous doormat types tend to freak people out."
"I can only say this under the protection of anonymity, otherwise I'd be accused of bragging...  I always thought there would come a day when my classmates would outperform me.

And holy shit, has it earned me a TON of hate/harassment, to the point where the campus police have had to get involved. Something I wrote my first year of grad school recently got published in an extremely prestigious journal, and I made my department chair swear to keep it secret, for fear that there'd be backlash."

"i was you once. i am now 39. i had my first actual friend at the age of 22. was a bit bullied.   my only regret right now 2019 is that i would now be in far far far better place if i would´ve focused on my future prospects instead.  you know what i did? ignored the school shit and plans and frantically tried to arrange stuff to meet people. it never registered to me that folks tend to be too drunk on hormones to notice everyone fairly. folks change. at that point, everyone is growing up. after a while, opinions of people change.  sure, it might be true that your circumstances are against you but there is wisdom at trying to arrange the rest of the details right. while folks are drunk on hormones, trying to be the next social elite, why not get a headstart on life &amp; shit? trust me on this: those circles of theirs are going to wither in the following five years"

Same. When my anxiety flares up I feel like this about everyone. When it's under control it's not an issue at all.
"Constantly criticizing everybody else because they don’t do things exactly the way you want them done.  Secure people are able to say to themselves “well, I guess different people do things different ways, and that’s OK.“  Insecure people consider different ways of doing things a possible clue that they are not doing things right themselves. So they lash out to cover their concern that they are being indirectly told that they are wrong."

For some people it seems hard to get this but kids, even toddlers, have personality traits, and wildly different experiences, so of course they will be different"

Dude where do  you think the insecurity came from?
Jealousy.

Having to tell anyone how intelligent you are.
Using words like 'cuck' or 'snowflake' unironically.
"When someone declares ""I'm the alpha"""
Instagram filters.
Ope
MAGA hat.
People who use man sized tissues. They exist!
When you feel the need to bash on someone that hasnt done you any wrong.
When a person's significant others gets angry at them for talking to members of the opposite sex.
"I like to think I'm a better person than I was 10 years ago, but I was cheating on my ex wife and was extremely paranoid. Constantly finding things that didn't exist or connecting dots that didn't make sense. It was hell."
Holy shit thank you for putting this into words
"ER doc here. No, they don’t. Infact treating them and making a fuss of them reinforces the problem and makes it much much worse. They need facts, delivered kindly and minimal fuss made of them.   These are actually the hardest people to manage, trying to sort out if they are actually sick or not, whilst not irradiating, needle pricking or over investigating them can get tricky.   THEN- you tell them that you can’t find anything wrong, and they don’t believe you- next day they are back. So you start over because you don’t want to miss anything, but starting over also buys into the problem....it’s difficult!"
"Trust me man, I’m 27 and starting my degree; just put in the work and no one will give a shit. Hell, being older, you know how to actually put in the work to make the degree happen."

Don't call me out like that
Talking about how confident you are.
"Yeah, I don't think there is anything wrong about being nice if you truly want to help people or make them feel better. If anything, the US in particular needs more nice people that give a damn about the struggles of others and not whine at the thought of tax money going towards social services.  Being ""too nice"" is only a problem when you let others manipulate you or it cuts into your other obligations in a major way when you give things up to be nice (but there are even exceptions to the latter during extreme circumstances, eg. harboring persecuted people from oppressive/genocidal authorities when there may be a great risk to your family)."
"40 year old woman making her 12-13 year old niece try on matching outfits with her, so she can point out how much thinner she is and how much better everything looks on her.  Yeah, my childhood was fucked up, and people wonder why I have an eating disorder...."

"I think people going into communities made for a game or show or something and making posts/comments about how that show/game sucks. Like, why are you even there if you don’t like it? Why do you feel the need to force your opinion onto people who just enjoy something you don’t? Like you can express your opinion, not saying that’s a bad thing, but doing it in a community made for fans of that thing you don’t like. That’s what’s dumb."

"The ""throwing a severed hand to shore to win"" thing is actually an [Irish legend](https://oneill.nd.edu/history/the-red-hand-of-oneill/) that's associated with a red hand motif on flags, family crests, etc. It's quite possible that his family claims to be descended from Niáll and the tattoo did actually hold some meaning for him, and either he or you got confused about where the story took place."

"I get the impulse to do this but like, its dumb. Like when I was younger I said I had two tamagachis instead of one. Who cares"
"I'm not a therapist or anything, just someone who was helped by one - but if I learned anything from myself, the anger combined with the pathological lying stems from some kind of insecurity linked to childhood trauma. He had most likely compartmentalized it and probably didn't even remember it, but that's probably what was poisoning his proverbial waterhole. And since you were most likely the closest person to him, you were subconsciously a direct threat to his intricately crafted narrative. As a result, you were on the receiving end of all of his ire.  Look. It wasn't your fault. And to be honest, I'm not going to say that it wasn't his fault either. Even when you're the person who is spinning the lies, you're conscious of it (at least up to a certain point), and refusing to get help is on you. That said, if my experience helps you find acceptance in what happened with him, and allows you to understand him a bit more and eventually heal and move on, then that makes me happy. :)"
When you constantly tell people you feel ugly or fat just so they tell you otherwise
"I had some jackass in a truck with over-sized tires turn onto the highway beside me but his turn was so wide he came half way into my lane and pushed me into oncoming traffic. When I honked, he gave me the finger."
"Right!! My ex boyfriend and I broke up and wanted to be friends after a while. His new girlfriend couldn’t take it. She made him block me on every form of social media despite the fact that I also had a new boyfriend. I get being skeptical but my boyfriend didn’t mind at all because he trusted me. I feel like even if someone did come onto you, your s/o should trust you enough to just deny them????"
"My mom likes to tell a story about how fucking stupid I was as a kid because she thinks it makes me seem smart for some reason. Apparently when I was in pre school doing the shapes in holes thing I couldn't get the diamond shaped one through because it was actually a square and I needed to turn it around. She tells this story constantly, Like it makes me look smart. It's so dumb"

"Short guys who drive, huge, jacked-up pick up trucks..."
"Posting constantly on your Instagram story about how good your life is. Seriously, my aunt does this and as it turns out, he was dealing cocaine and shit. Now he's a snitch with all of the drug money confiscated. And this was all because of him not wanting a 9-5."
"Lying constantly about your experiences and how you feel about certain things. I have a friend who I’ve known for a really long time, and every story she tells whether it’s about her love life or daily life can be traced back to a tumblr post. I confront her about it but she denies it. She goes “I never cry haha” and “I don’t need boys, I’m a queen” but the next week she’s crying over a guy because he ignored her."
"I, myself, have friends that always make fun of my relationships for no reason and also brag 24/7 365,about how much better than me they are. So i'd say bragging and teasing show that they are jealous and insecure"

"Seeing a therapist for things regarding this and I've learned so far from my 'homework' that everyone irritates each other and everyone worries about being liked. Even our romantic partners aren't going to be perfect, they'll have flaws that you either fall in love with or your can tolerate. I think because I expect perfection from myself, I expect it from others and use it as an excuse to avoid people (introvert).  She believes my father is autistic and I'm starting to wonder if this is a mild autism thing (or it could be purely insecurity) because I can't for the life of me grasp the workings of a friendship group and I need constant reassurance that people like me being there, otherwise I feel like I'm a burden no-one likes around. It sucks because this is holding me back socially. I'm learning a lot though, especially accepting my own flaws and not being hard on myself.  If only there were more people like you who recognises this in people and reassures/explains it to them."

Our relationship stays stable because of it."

If you're saying that the Trump administration is in someway anti-corruption you are lying.
I don't necessarily think this is always purely insecurity. I know my friends all genuinely enjoy my company but I have pretty severe anxiety over basically anything social and find that I have to reassure myself of these friendships regularly.  In therapy working on it but yeah. Not saying there's 0 insecurity there but I know it's a bit more nuanced than that.
Is it okay if they do it like liquiders?
"Well obviously you don't treat them for the illness they don't have. You treat them for hypochondria which is a type of anxiety. They need CBT and likely an SSRI to manage their crippling anxiety. The ones who end up in the ER chronically are usually resistant to seeing a psychiatrist but those who aren't as bad usually know they have a problem and want to get better. Either way, they needed to be treated for hypochondria. Just like how Munchausen's is an illness, hypochondria is an illness."
Sounds like a beta cuck thing to say bruh.
Guys who try to “alpha up” on other guys and girls who act dumb/ditzy around groups of people. Basically just says “I don’t like myself as I am so I need to put on a facade to make sure people like me or know I’m in control”  Also dudes who actively brag about girls they’ve slept with. If you just say you got laid I’ll MAYBE give you a pat on the back but other than that I don’t care lmao I’m not gonna be impressed or think any more highly of you because you have sex
"My roommate's GF did that last week, in an argument she just casually mentions ""oh btw I'm coughing up blood"" so he just stops and asks ""did you go to the doctor?"" ... ""no"".  And then it was never mentioned again."

"This is how it was for me.  I felt so bad that I went through that phone to confirm my fears but glad I ultimately did, because she flat out told me she would have never have come clean with it.   It wasn't my normal to snoop.  But the behavior over the previous 3 days was so off, and she was being so cagey, I broke down and grabbed the phone when she went upstairs. It honestly fucked me up and still struggle with trust issues.  I try to be aware of it when it's happening so I can let it go and talk it out if I need to."

"I remember this one person from highschool would always tag themselves as ""feeling sad/lonely"" then a few people would always ask whats wrong, or if they wanted to talk and the person who would tag themselves would always say don't ask, so eventually people stopped asking what was wrong, then they would stop getting the attention from everyone asking and double down and would start typing suicidal shit, then people would ask whats wrong and the cycle would repeat."

"I tend to be insecure honestly, when I was 16 I had a brain tumor and that was 7 years ago (I got rid of it) and since then I've been shutting pretty much everyone out and dont exactly trust anyone even though I want to. Although that prob leads into indecisive behavior more then insecure but it's both. What screams insecure? I have no idea but I have a feeling you have plenty of answers"
"&gt;A stupid expensive and unnecessarily loud car/mororcycle that you just HAVE TO rev up periodically for no good reason.  Revving it for no reason is annoying as fuck, I agree. But ""unnecessarily loud"" is subjective. Some people love cars/motorcycles and modifying them is fun. I'm not sure that you thinking something is loud is insecure."
To me an insecure person is anyone who wears a bunch of make up and shows their cleavage when actually they would be very pretty with little to no make up and there’s really no reason to show cleavage unless you’re trying to get attention.
"That is one of the hallmarks of insecurity, people thinking someone doesn't like them and being too concerned about it, making them give off the vibe that they want to be validated by that person and they want to feel like they have worth. They don' t realize worth can come from yourself. You don't need others to feel worthy.  Yes I am doing very well, playing chess and having fun watching YouTube."

"Is this something that happens often too? You just walk in to your bathroom and realize that your mirror is on the floor waiting to be installed. ""oh whoops I forgot again. I guess I'll do it later today."""
That's me every day after a friend of mine told me in 6th grade that a teacher made her group of friends be nice to me because I was lonely. She (the friend) said she thought that lying to me that they like me is just cruel. She was right.

"Flexing. Proverbial and literal. I knew a kid who made a point about how much he could drink, how big his hands were, how much money he made, how much pain he could tolerate.   If you feel the need to one-up someone in a conversation even about the most basic shit. You probably have some insecurity issues."
"I have to agree, unless in a technical professional setting, and then they proceed to show you the better way.   I work with this guy who has been in my industry for 30+ years and he will always tell you how you are doing something wrong, or the hard way. He will then show you the right, or easy way. Was annoying when I first started there but I think about it differently now, an old man is showing the new generation how its done, so we dont have to learn the hard way costing us labor time."

In fact, I've found the opposite to be true."

"Honestly? Probably a mix of self-obsession and insecurity. You’re self-obsessed because you dwell on how every little thing makes you feel inadequate. You’re insecure because, again, you feel inadequate.  I suspect that people who rely on self-deprecation as a medium for communication do so in an attempt to either solicit compliments or reaffirm their negative thoughts about themselves.  I’m making a lot of assumptions based on a few guys I know who can’t stop talking down to themselves."

"Yes to this, I am guilty, I’m so damn insecure. I think it is that I’m so afraid of not being a good enough mom, so that I seek confirmation that my kid is on track and I succeeded in parenting her to do the most common things. When I realized I had this thoughts while looking in mommy groups I really try not to engage in any of it and unfollowed some groups, it really only hurt myself to engage in this (as my kid doesn’t yet are old enough to read the embarrassment). Trying to get that confirmation that I’m an okey mom from an mom group on internet is really so short term, constantly keeping that anxiety if I will be good enough next week. Really easy to be dragged in to those thoughts when being so insecure to begin with.   Now I try to just be cheerful at accomplishments instead of comparing them. Trying to mind that it is okey that some kids do things early or later but that doesn’t grade how good of a parent I am. One thing is being proud of my kid and that feels okey, but that isn’t something I have to show of to everyone else, it is important that my kids knows not the whole internet.  I try to be mindful to not let my insecurities compare my child to an other, feels much better to not feed this insecurities, but can’t declare myself free of this as I really need to actively work at this."

"Excellent way of explaining and breaking down the situation! When people are insecure, they tend to do things they later regret.

"you’re not wrong. it takes a lot of maturity and being secure with yourself to be able to handle the truth. i feel like the people who i can ask a question and expect an honest answer are often the most mature and can see from different perspectives. most times, this “no bullshit” attitude while still being a respectful human being doesn’t come naturally; especially with social norms and just the way different people are brought up. self reflection and being able to question yourself and how you act is the cause of this attitude.   you cant just straight up ask someone “hey man u a decent human being or a hot sack of shit? the way i see it, if you or another person can’t have a respectful debate with someone (i.e. raising your voice, close mindedness, uses a confirmation bias), then that’s an indicator that you (not actually you just anyone in general) or the other person are not mature enough to tell the truth while still being respectful. this can bleed into other areas, such as insecurity."

"A person screaming ""I' m very insecure"""
"&gt;...I need constant reassurance that people like me being there, otherwise I feel like I'm a burden no-one likes around.   Are you me?"
"Having a loud truck/motorcycle, you're just screaming for people to look at you and think your cool when in actuality you're super fucking annoying"
When you can't even walk by people without pulling out your phone to look at it until you make it past that person
"This. I would like to specify that positive affirmation and self talk can be good things. Alternatively, when it is used to compare yourself to others and their shortcomings - constantly using others failures as a ladder in which to elevate yourself - that shit is unacceptable."
Revving your engine super loud
When someone continuously makes fun of people and is just an asshole.
I used to have this mindset and i knew i was being irrational until i was proved right and i found out everyone in my friend group actually did hate me. :/
"Ill admit I'm am not insecure but I am suspicious of my husband when his phone digs a lot. Last may I caught him flirting with someone online. He said it was just to get stuff in an mmo but they were talking every morning afternoon and night. I told him to put an end to it. He deleted his accounts. Turns out this person wasn't happy about his sudden disappearance. They started investgatiing, questioning where we lived. So yeah. I'm a little paranoid about it."

"Somebody in my city nearly killed someone by roaling coal past a stopped vehicle out of impatience.    The reason the vehicle was stopped was because a pedestrian was crossing. The truck driver hit the pedestrian and then attempted to flee the scene. Others drivers who saw what happened boxed him in, preventing him from fleeing.    Other bystanders helped create a corridor for an ambulance and directed them to the scene.    The pedestrian was so badly hurt by the impact, she was presumed dead by reporters. When the story hit the news, it was initially reported as a fatal accident.    Everyone in town heard about it and fully expected him to be charged with manslaughter. But the pedestrian ended up surviving. But she had tens of thousands of dollars in debt for treatment and now has a permanent disability.    He was charged with felony hit and run instead. This was over a year ago. I still don't know if he was convicted.    Fuck this, and anyone who does this on city streets. It's not only reckless because of the environmental cost. It involves rapid acceleration inappropriate for city streets. It's dangerous and stupid.

"I did too! It eventually became her excuse for everything, slacking off, abusing, random temper tantrums, being outright rude to other people in my class, sometimes even to the Professors... it was bad. I think she got therapy, hopefully she's better now."
"I'll admit, I do this a lot because in my mind at the time I think it's because I want to be recognized in any way possible... It disgusts me. I don't have the best social life and don't interact much with other people because I'm ""afraid"" of how people might think of me. It's not a good way to live at all, especially if you are constantly in edge and in fear if everything.   What's weird is that I love attention, yet at the same time I don't... I hate being put under a spotlight, and and the quietest person in the group with everything I do, unless my one friend is there.... Then I'm the loudest in the room.   It's gotten better over the years. All it takes is some dedication to interacting with people more  I've learned that the best way to adapt and learn is to sometimes step out of your comfort zone...  To anyone else who has social issues... I understand your pain, things will get better. Just believe"

Feeling that you have the need to explain everything about what you do or say to other people
"&gt;How much responsibility should you take on to fix someone else?  Why do you people even get into relationships if you ask questions like that? What is a relationship to you? An economic contract or something? Whats even the point of being in relationships if not for the things like that?  Or what, you expect your partner to be supportive but when its your turn you'll bail?  &gt;but if you’re always in a rough patch  There can be situations like that. However when it comes to unfixable things, most of them are pretty obvious and can be noticed before you commit to a relationship. Also sometimes things might seem to be unfixable, but thats just your ignorance making you feel that way. There is an insane amount of knowledge that has been accumulated by humanity over the past few centuries and you can use that knowledge to fix most of the things."

I always kinda thought the more a person posts on social media the more insecure they are. Unless they're old and legit think people give a shit about their stupid grandchildren.
"When my brother's and I moved into our step mom's house with my dad I was very nervous because I don't just blindly trust anyone. I never knew our step mom before this and my dad knew her from when they were kids and got back together when my dad finally left us in California.   I kept track of the personality that my step mom exerted and the way she interacts with my brothers and my dad. She's very religious, shes almost 50 and they had to borrow $10,000 from my grandmother to be able to get into the house they are in. When I step back and look at their situation I definitely wouldn't consider her or my dad very successful at all.   I got a job quick and founded my own success with little to no help from them, and it gave me a broader outlook in my life that I never had before and I started to really be critical of those around me. After all, if I; as a millennial; can work hard and make it there is no reason they couldn't either. But they are constantly trying to find a ""way out"" of doing labor and working.   It's just aggravating because frankly the more I watch the more I see that they act like children. 40/50 year old children. Posting ridiculous edgy things and corny memes on Facebook, in a massive religious circle jerk on Facebook.   See that story is all a rant because I read this comment and thought about the situation I was in back then, stuck living in a home with those 2 big babies. We were talking about it one day, and I told my step mom that the only reason I was even still on Facebook was because its the only way family wants to communicate anymore and I really just keep my account active to talk to my Grandpa, and my sister back in California. Other than that, I just find Facebook and the people that spend all their time on it toxic and it gives people a false sense of community.   My step mom said to me ""I love Facebook, it saved my life, it brought me and your dad back together.""  I really had to analyze that, because I suppose it is true that it brought them back together. And I may even be a toxic person but I still wish for my dad and her to be happy, and I am happy that they found happiness in each other.  It is definitely a blessing. But I still think they spend to much time on Facebook, I think if they spend the energy and time that they use up on social media. Hours and hours of nothing but looking at dumb shit on Facebook. And then all the church things that they preach on Facebook and then don't practice in person. If they put that energy into something different, something productive, they'd be better off. Instead they want to charge my 2nd youngest brother $500 a month as soon he graduated just because my 3rd youngest brother and I moved out when I bought my house, so now they are struggling financially. And they force him to go to a ""youth group"" where Church leaders talk about life lessons and saving money. Which as much as I agree that he needs to learn to save money, forcing him to go to church is not okay, he is 18, and he is not comfortable at church. Not to mention all the shame she throws on social media because none of us wanted to go to church, and none of us wanted to go with her to a church beach thing because it's uncomfortable for all of us except her and my dad.  I definitely think that social media, specifically Facebook are, or at least, have become very toxic. And it 100% gives a lot of people a false sense of security. And like you are saying, checking in everywhere you go, or posting dumb crap like ""Oh i just don't feel like getting out of bed today - feeling depressed"" and then refuse to talk to anyone, just shut the hell up. Just shut the hell up, you just want to make everyone feel bad for you and then not accept when people are reaching out to you. That's a belittlement of people who actually struggle every day with simply reaching their damn arm up to turn the alarm off on their phone. And you are just complaining cause you are pasty and fat and do nothing to change that  Sorry, I'm really high and your comment made me feel like I needed to get that out of my system. Will probably delete later."

"Do you struggle with impostor syndrome? It's extremely common. You haven't said it explicitly, but it's basically feeling like a fraud and that you could be 'exposed' and fail. I get it sometimes, as do many others. I just wanted to say it's okay and that you should maybe speak to someone about it at your institution.  I've recently started a postgraduate programme and while I do suffer from impostor syndrome, stress, anxiety and depression I'm aware of them and try to reassure myself that I'm in the right place and do have the skills to proceed, as much as I try to convince myself that I don't. I felt completely lost for the first month of my postgraduate studies, so I mentioned this to classmates and every one that I asked felt the same way. I'm sure other people that are in a similar position to you in your institution feel demoralised too.  You said that you advanced to candidacy, so you're good enough. They know you're good enough, everyone else does too, you just have to believe it. Being in postgrad isn't about knowing everything, they might have shredded you on everything you don't know, but they deemed you good enough to continue on your quest for new knowledge. I think in a lot of ways education at this level is 'learning to learn' more than any other. It's fucking hard being cut down, but it's for you to see your flaws and better them, not because you're bad.  Maybe your institution isn't welcoming, but if they have a support network you might want to look into it. They clearly think you're good enough, they might just be unwelcoming. Sorry if this is a bit long by the way...  [TLDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE)"

When it all fell apart over a fight between the two people who thought the group revolved around them, everyone in it kinda went to the sidelines and hung out with me over the squabbling duo, and that's when I learned that I was, infact, a very highly regarded member of the group. The two people squabbling however, thought I was only in the group because they felt bad for me. How wrong they were in the end 😂😂"
Exactly. The posts being referred to here are the over the top gushing about their SO when you actually know them and know that they’re one fight about toilet paper away from a divorce.

Now she’s turning into more of a person, but also much more of a puppy, too? Tearing shit up, trying to get into things, trying to get out, biting, chasing balls around....   In any case, I think the perspective is really helpful because it feels more manageable that way.

A couple of them were super pissed, coz they looked up to him for having good grades, but it turned out he had worse grades than them.   1 year after graduation, he sent an apology email to everyone in the group. I met him a year later, and he was still doing that. Then he got married and i met him couple of years later, and it felt like he had improved, coz i saw him being more genuine. His wife is also amazing, so that might have helped."
Literally anything and everything Donald Trump has ever said or done. I wish this was in any way hyperbolic... it is not. He is the living embodiment of insecurity... which turns out is a really bad thing. Who knew?

Not really a friend anymore tbh :/ we use to have a small group we all were in and we would constantly tell her she needs to leave em cause she would call us cryin. She would basically want someone to listen to her problems but didn’t want to do anything about it. It was super exhausting until she cut all contact with her “friends” for “being fake” I haven’t heard from her in over a year and I couldn’t be happier but I do still see her FB posts about her BF. I hope she can come to her senses and leave tha guy but I doubt it

"Weirdly enough, I had a friend that NEVER made up bullshit. I knew him since like grade school.   He graduated high school, and he and some other guys I knew got an apartment and went to college together. Out of nowhere, the guy starts telling ridiculous lies. The same level as your ex. Everyone moved out and rarely speaks to him anymore.   I think it’s possible your ex had thus happen as well. I think the real world slapped my friend in the face, and he felt inferior or something. He also became a car salesman.   I’m in sales, and some salesman are definitely fucked up. The majority do not tell ridiculous lies like this. The guys that can’t ‘turn off the switch’ when they walk out of the office are the crazy ones."

"People who constantly post “inspirational” quotes online. The worst offenders that I’ve noticed are women (although men do it as well) using filters on their already heavily Botoxed faces, fake hair, and plastic surgery laden bodies carrying on about “just being yourself because it’s what’s inside that really counts”. To me, that comes off as rather hypocritical."

"So, I live in a small town and they only have one high school and a middle school but they have elementary split in half in two different school. So I went to home coming for my high school because my friend convinced me, and I have bad social anxiety and I can’t focus when there is a lot of noise going on. So this was not a good idea!!! I get to the dance and meet my friend in the cafeteria which is close to where the gym is, we go to the gym and it is chaos in there. Everything was going on at once, music was blaring, my friend was trying to get me to dance, people were shouting and the floor was bouncing from the dancing( the school is about 50 to 60 years old, so the gym floors I think have only been replaced once)and people were wave surfing, I go over to the wall and sit down because I was panicking inside, and my friend tries to get me to dance more. We ended up losing sight of each other for about half the dance. So I go into the bathroom and almost start baling my eyes out because of how much I was freaking out in my head, I go to the cafeteria where they have all the drinks and food. I grab a cookie and start eating it, I ate about a total of 4 cookies before I felt better to back into the gym( I’m a skinny person and no matter how much I eat I can barley gain anything). We find each other close to the end of the dance and we finish it off.  Overall, if you have social anxiety don’t go to a dance that you might think will make you panic at, but if it’s high school homecoming or prom then you should most likely go with a friend"

"I used to be this type of person, though I did try to consider other parties' intentions, too.  It was just fear of contact and vulnerability going haywire. That fear would transfer to the people I loved, and I would unintentionally make them miserable while ""looking out for them."" A major part of what kept this game at play was people refusing to be honest about how I hurt them. I had few genuine connections, was/am inherently burdensome, and had zero appreciation for tact.  I eventually reached out to everyone I hurt, just to say sorry. I probably still do some of this without realizing it, but I try so hard to be mindful of my capacity for it. The difference is that I am focused on those around me instead of myself. I simply thought I was before; that is what made me so volatile.   I am truly sorry that anyone has to be on the receiving end of it, though. I know it has to be difficult to endure, since it's difficult to cause. Cycles of pain and fear always are. I hope your loved ones get better or at least manageable someday."
"Oh, im good at this one. I used to he very insecure and craved attention when I was a preteen.

Had a good friend when I was younger who lied about just about everything to seem cool. It was fairly embarrassing.
"I do this daily. Example: constantly referring to myself as a piece of shit; apologizing/calling out my stupidity; regularly mentioning my lack of any discernible talents; routinely thanking people for putting up with my bullshit (i.e. if I make a small mistake or something at work)...the list goes on. I’m just always bullying myself in front of people so that I take any power away from peers to dish out any of their own put downs because ridicule is my biggest fear in life.  For me though, it’s not coming from a place of fishing, I don’t need people to deny what I say, I just feel the need to say them before they can."

If there's something wrong that they can easily fix like their makeup's smudged or there's something in their teeth, let them know (discreetly, of course). If they ask for your opinion, be honest. I guess wording makes a difference too ('I don't know if that dress is working for you' vs 'you look fat'), but in the end, they shouldn't really get mad at you for being truthful if they ask for an opinion.   But if nobody asked and there's nothing they can do about it, telling them their clothes are unflattering or they stink or something is unnecessary and dickish. Keep quiet in those situations, or at least tell them once they're at home or something."

"I did this in high school. It's been over a decade but I still cringe.   I've never talked about this, even online to strangers, this is so uncomfortable to type out... but these are things I did age 15-16:  Worked in a fast food restaurant and told the older (18-19) guys there I smoked weed to seem cool. One day they bring a joint and give it to me to hit it out back (the idea was to take turns while the others worked). I have never even seen a joint IRL so I went out and attempted to smoke it. I put the wrong end in my mouth and singed the filter, and then gave it back. ""Yeah dude got a pretty good hit offa that"". The look on the dude's face was of complete bewilderment.   Told my friend group that I did mushrooms. One dude who knew me best instantly suspected I was lying and asked me to describe the experience. I said ""umm uhh well the colours were like....vivid"" and when he asked for more details, I just kept saying how ""vivid"" it was.   Made a fake weed baggy with green tea and flashed it to kids at school. No further comment necessary.  Dropped ""hints"" of my pretend weed use when answering personal questions in class. Like on Mondays in one class the teacher liked to go around and ask us about our weekends. Not sure what I said but I remember my teacher cringing every time my turn came  So yeah... it took repeated humiliation for me to grow up, but luckily I haven't made things up since. For what it's worth, where I lived at the time weed was still quite illegal so there was definitely a ""cool"" factor associated with it at the time. Of course now it's not a big deal at all."

"yeah, I didn't mean 'only' in the literal sense, more like 'ain't nobody got time to keep things separate'.  I suspect you know the deal.

From there it doesn't take long to start sharing accounts."

It's that people, especially here on Reddit, bring politics and Trump into everything and it's just annoying. We get it, you hate Trump. We get it, Trump is not a very good president, in your opinion. Please don't spam it on every single post that you see. The original AskReddit question is very interesting and can bring some good discussion/whatever with it. You don't need to bring politics into that just to spread your personal ideology/agenda."
"Well said, and all the edits too :) I remember admiring a high school pal who went on and on about her marriage. I will say they both worked hard to build a good relationship with the ex wife and coparent that child, and also worked hard to be good parents for their two bio kids together. He brought her flowers every week and she would always post things about 'my favorite place is in my husband's arms' etc. Single me was super envious and figured there must be only ten men like that in the whole world!!!! Then they got divorced and turns out he basically abandoned all their kids and was doing drugs. Wonder how much of that behavior overlapped during their happy Facebook time. Taught me a lot about social media presence and how it can all be a facade, just like people pretending things are hunky dory to their real life friends."
"I have this exact problem but am slowly learning what you taught your friend. It's so hard when you have anxiety to figure out whether people actually hate you or if you're just being anxious. And it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy too. You feel like people dislike you, so you get either distant or super clingy or act super insecure, and they end up actually disliking you because of that behavior."

Always seeking approval from others. Unsure about every decision you make because you don’t trust your own judgment that you allow friends or family decide for you.
"I moved across the country for ASU! Best decision I ever made. The Midwest was...not a good fit for me in any way. Going to ASU really saved me and I have a great job! I did party my ass off while in attendance but in my friends circle there was a big push for “homework first, party hard after.” I didn’t know anyone who didn’t graduate and go on to be doing well in life. ASU is what you make it and if you can’t self-police and handle responsibilities before partying, it may not be the best choice. It definitely was the best choice for me, however."

Same. To that mindset it's not supposed to change the course of the conversation. You probable expect them to continue afterwards.

Not everyone communicates the same way. I love that kind of communication.

Overly contrary people. You don’t have to disagree with everything. It doesn’t make you seem like you have knowledge on a wide variety of subjects...  Or really people trying to argue about something that they know very little about or only have one facet of knowledge about. They know you’re pulling shit out of your ass. Just listen.

After all, a cyclist is way more vulnerable than a motorcyclist."

Screaming “I’m very insecure” That’s always a dead give away.

"Unfortunately I have had this done to me, One girl out of the group of ""friends"" invited me to her party as she felt sorry for me because I tagged along with their group, later in the night her sister punched a drunk me and told me the truth.....   so yeah I'm insecure when it comes to people liking me."

Yeah I'd say a large portion of people are fairly shitty.  Most people are pretty oblivious to it. Or they like how shitty people feed their ego.
"Making a post asking people what makes other people think you're insecure, because you are insecure about being insecure"
"&gt; I did not say that anyone has to agree or even that my assessment is entirely correct.  that's fine, I said that they wouldn't be justified based upon that, not that you were telling them to agree. I dont' care about absolute certainty either. You were making a claim, I'm saying your claim is unjustified.  That claim, I'm sure you would agree, is either True or False. It cannot be both, and it must be one of them. Whether someone agrees or disagrees is irrelevant to whether or not it is true, correct?  So what I'm saying Kay, if you are going to hold the belief that the claim is true (or false), based upon personal experience, you are unjustified in your belief because you are not a objective observer of your own experience. In order to hold a reasonable position you need to either say ""I don't know"" or demonstrate the truth of your claim in a way which others can reliably verify, which so far you have not."

"Some people may say it’s autism, but it could very well be that for whatever reason (upbringing) you never saw what a ‘normal’ or healthy relationship was like. That can have a huge impact when you get older."
The couples that I notice doing that are actually the ones that are constantly fighting/ have a very toxic and abusive relationship.
"The point is that is you share all your passwords etc, you trust your partner NOT to do this He can have access to all my stuff, and i trust hed never read the convo my bff and i have going on  If either of these things are an issue id probably not stay with my part er"
"Full contour makeup with huge drawn on eyebrows and crazy long false lashes every single day. What do you even really look like?! No one knows...  Same for people just COVERED in tattoos so you can't even see their human skin anymore.   Funnily enough, studies have shown that insecure people tend to get more tattoos BUT people with tattoos say they help boost self esteem. So I guess this is one of those instances where the thing that shows your insecurity can actually help you to become less insecure..?"
&gt; In a terrible relationship? You stay because you’re scared of being alone.   I feel attacked
"This can also be a sign of anxiety-related issues, both my SO and I have been through it. In my case it was definitely linked to insecurity, for her it was more of a GAD thing"

"I worked with a woman who started telling a few of us in the break room about her fear of flying (I’m sure it must’ve come up because someone else said they were scared to fly) and by the end of the conversation she was insisting to us that she needed to be sedated to fly. But wait, there’s more! She needs injections of sedatives BUT she’s scared of needles. Severe phobia of course. So she can’t KNOW the injection is coming, they have to sneak up on her! Ya know, as you do!  This woman wanted us to believe that, in order to get on a plane, someone at the airport (airport staff I think she said, like, WTF?!) has to sneak up behind her and jab her with a needle to sedate her, then drag her ass onto a plane. -_-"

I used to be a storyteller. Like shit that felt like tall tales and such because they were. I spent so much time as literally the smartest person I knew when it came to actual education that I realized I was teaching myself to either lie or make shit up just to impress people with answers to questions they had.   Until I realized that the things I've actually accomplished and experienced are way more interesting to people than what was obviously bullshit to them. I was so insecure about how people perceived me that I wasn't even allowing myself to celebrate my actual victories.

You can really tell how insecure someone is based on how many times they say “lol” in a text
"You have like 26 starting points. If you go both ways it's 52.  Even if you add more variety like going horizontal, that's like 100-200 unique sequences. That's nothing against the tens or hundreds of thousands phrases that are going to be checked in a dictionary attack. And as long as it fits into the ""simple sequence"" scheme that was laid out here I'm quite sure it's going to be checked.   You obviously need to decide for yourself how important your security is, also given the specific circumstance. I'm just wondering why someone would bother with such a long password if it's as easily cracked as a short simple one..."
I don’t think either is bad if it’s for the right reasons. Some women have more masculine traits and find hanging out with men more fun/satisfying and some men have more feminine traits and enjoy hanging with women more. Gender is blurry you should hang out with whoever you have satisfying relationships with.

What did you study?"
"Adding on for good measure, the internal monologue for insecure people isn't malicious. If I'm not looking you in the eyes while we're talking, I'm probably afraid you'll be offended if I do. If I'm not talking about myself to others, I probably think nobody would be interested to hear about me. I usually find the corner at parties, and leave ASAP. I minimize social interaction to avoid testing my hypothesis about these things, because deep down I'm pretty sure it's not a hypothesis."

"Thanks for sharing your story. Mine is similar, used to be a terrible liar and also had a mom who was that way. The weird thing was, I didn't lie about things to get any kind of tangible advantages for myself -- like I never lied in any way that profited me financially or anything like that. But I used to tell ridiculous, stupid lies to answer questions like, ""So what did you do this weekend?"" I'd try to make my life sound so much more interesting than it was, and then sometimes I'd get called out on it because I lied about ridiculous shit I knew nothing about. I remember one time I answered, ""Oh, it was great, Saturday I got free tickets right behind home plate at the Yankee game."" And I was so stupid I didn't realize the Yankees had been rained out on Saturday and the guy I'm talking to is a big Yankees fan so he obviously knows that and now I look like a total idiot and try to scramble like, ""Oh, did I say Saturday? I meant Friday night. Did they play Friday night? Of course they did, I was there.""  I've worked on it and now I try really hard to be scrupulously honest. Still not perfect on the honesty front but I'm much, much better than I used to be."

You deny that these people, who we’ve all seen and heard, do not exist? His close friend and former campaign manager doesn’t have a news site with a “black crime” section? He doesn’t say he only wants immigrants from places like Norway? A trump supporter writing a manifesto talking about a “great replacement” did not murder 21 Hispanic people in El Paso? A trump supporter didn’t kill 9 people in the Tree of Life Synagogue because he thought Jews were sponsoring the caravans and “invasion” Trump was talking about on the news? None of that happened? He didn’t call people chanting “Jews will not replace us” very find people?"

"I work in a rural area with a high poverty level and it's crazy to see how many people fail to achieve career success, and make it a generational trend by talking up whatever basic job they have (or not having one) and shitting on their kids for wanting to achieve something beyond settling for that or failing into the army.  When kids come into my shop and bother to make conversation I always ask what they want to do or what they want to go to college to study, and then I help them find some online educational resources to get ahead of the game if we're not busy.   We had a kid working with us for his first job and he'd talk about how he'd like to go to college for mythological history and how much he enjoyed reading the old Greek stories in school so I'd always chat with him about it and try to help him find information that would help with relevant studies/career. One day I was in the middle of explaining how he could dual-major in that and something more traditionally marketable so he'd not only have either option open to him, but also have the potential to combine different fields of expertise to carve out his own niche when his dad walked in to pick something up and overheard us talking. He just started shitting all over his son about how he was never going to succeed at that and his only choice was to ""get a real job"" or join the army. When that kid and I got robbed at gunpoint he came down to the shop and started acting like the kid was a pussy for not going over the counter to attack the person who was standing about 10 feet back on the other side of it with a gun trained on him. Last I heard the kid signed up with the army and bought a sports car.  It's crazy how common that is around here. People idolize the ""simple man"" and act like everyone who accomplishes more than them must be fucking up or wasting their time somehow because that can be the only explanation for why they aren't the ones doing it."

"Yes.   My grandparents are in extreme debt and have remortgaged twice now. I give them most of the meat that I gather from whitetail. They can barely afford medication and we had to pay for a valve replacement surgery for my grandad 2 years ago. We pay some of his bills.   I give them the meat, they cook it and eat it, they don’t starve, and they can stave off the debt for a little longer. It’s so much debt that my parents probably won’t be able to pay it off before they die and therefore it will come to me and my sister as well. The way I see it, it’s for my survival as well."

Not everyone likes everyone, and that’s okay.   I think people care more about being believed than “liked”. You can not like someone and still have belief in their words, which is basic respect  By the way, introversion *does not* mean that you avoid people. It means that being around people is taxing on your person and you need time alone to recover, whether you enjoy being around those people or not.   People who say they’re introverted to avoid people are moreso avoiding their own social anxiety"

"Knowingly installing a loud engine into a car that makes the car sound like it belongs in a scrap heap. Or a muffler that makes a normally quiet car as loud as a freight train. Either (or both) of those at ANY stop light/sign and then revving as loud as possible when it's time to move. Bonus insecurity points if they're revving loudly at a downtown light and they're behind someone, practically screaming ""Let me be loud AND excessively fast in this 35mph city zone already!""  Motorcycles can be an exception to the noise because maybe they're concerned about being hard to see. Like, interstate or highway, be loud to be seen. But downtown while stopped or in a quiet school zone, chill your ego. (If the revving while stopped is to prevent stalling, I apologize, I don't ride and don't know if that's the case.)"
Constantly checking your significant other/spouse/partners phone or holding onto it.

"i definitely agree with you. and it’s especially difficult when you love someone that’s plain rude and want to believe they are just a straight up person, but you can’t convince yourself when the evidence is right there.  lets say you are shopping with a friend and she tries on a shirt. she asks you what you think - your honest opinion. you don’t think it’s the most flattering, so you tell her just that. whether or not she buys it is still up to her, and now she can take your opinion into consideration. if she doesn’t like your opinion, then that’s on her because she asked, and you gave a respectful yet honest answer. this is being a “straight up” person  but pretend the same scenario happens, but u r actually a POS human (just for this example:)). before she even gets the chance the ask for your opinion, you tell her it’s the ugliest shirt you’ve ever seen and that she looks 10 pounds heavier wearing it. she didn’t ask your opinion, and you said it in the most blatantly rude way possible - precision of language is important, because ultimately, the other person still has feelings. this is just being an asshole. that’s pretty much how i see the difference between the two. the two questions to answer are: - was their opinion warranted? - did their language have a negative connotation? or you can just call her out on it next time she does it lol (respectfully tho, otherwise she’ll get defensive). that’s honestly how people become more cognizant of this type of stuff (but should only be done if it is negative behavior, not something they can’t control). she can deny it all she wants, but being unnecessarily rude is often associated with insecurity.  once she realizes that her blatant rudeness if driving her friends away - the people that help give her security - then she’ll recognize it whenever she does it and will make an effort to fix it. this obviously isn’t the case with everyone, but you shouldn’t be friends with those people who make no effort to curb their rudeness."

"To the second paragraph fair enough though it find it weird that you seem so...critical of the notion as if mentoring and giving advice to future generations is a bad thing. I should also mention the mutliple relationships that flow out of family with in-laws, grandkids, etc. are things people value too and sometimes adopting may not make as much sense (rules governing how long and how much paperwork is required for adoption differs by state...as does cost).  To the first paragraph I think you are still very wrong. The two reach to the same goal but by different means. A sterile animal clearly is not going to be a ""parent"" but oftentimes you can find such animals or even people assisting relatives though there is no special obligation to do so. This goes to your initial question of why people might value certain kids over others. Yes the answer is still housed within biological drives, but there are nuances in that explanation you just gloss over as well as with the other points I made.   I think you have the answer to your own question its just you find the answers to be shitty ones. That is fine but it doesn't mean there isn't a rhyme or reason as to why things are as they are."

"Glad I scrolled to find this comment. My last long term relationship was with someone who constantly lied and hid things—I’m still not entirely sure if he actually cheated or not, but he certainly made attempts to do so. I was never one to snoop but one day, after we had been living together for about 2 years, he didn’t log out of his Facebook on my laptop and I got curious. He was messaging multiple girls, including an ex, asking to hang out, complimenting them, etc. I confronted him about it, he blamed it all on me saying I was wrong because I didn’t feel comfortable with him hanging out with other girls alone (mind you it’s not like he had any very close girl friends which would’ve been different). He said nothing ever came of any of them and none of the conversations went beyond Facebook. I broke up with him temporarily, but stupidly took him back because he convinced me I was in the wrong (he gaslighted me about mostly everything).  Fast forward another 6 months and I had an opportunity to look through his phone. I did, and found a long text thread between him and his ex, who he was desperately pursuing and she wasn’t really responsive to. There were also a couple other random texts with a girl I knew he was “previously” in to. Repeat the same steps as above, and I got back together with him *again*. Not to mention, he would often not save people’s numbers so every time he was texting after that, I felt sick to my stomach. Every. Time.   Another 6 months and we were on a vacation that I planned and paid for. We were fighting a lot and I went through his phone for the last time. I saw that he had deleted some messages between him and this girl I didn’t know (the thread started mid-conversation). He lied, gaslighted, and I let it go, for the moment. The next day I just texted her, not angry, but had to know. She apologized profusely and said she didn’t know he had a girlfriend, but that nothing happened.  He had hung out with her multiple times and I know for sure one time he had left my house and told me he was going to [insert close guy friend’s name here]. I left him on vacation and that was the end. I tried so hard to be everything for this person and it still wasn’t enough. I didn’t and still don’t feel like I’m enough or deserving, even though logically I know I have a lot to offer.  I’m in the most ideal relationship of my life at the moment. I have no reason not to trust him and it hurts him *and me* that I question him more than is necessary. He keeps the sound on his phone on and I didn’t understand why every time he got a text, I would get annoyed and ask him to turn his sound off. I have it in the back of my mind not to believe him when he says he’s hanging out with a guy friend. I’m weirdly jealous and insecure about his ex who he hasn’t talked to in forever and has no desire to. It’s embarrassing.   I don’t know if anyone will even read this but I think I just needed to get it out. Yes, some people (men and women) do this to control, but I think there’s a lot of people like me who have just been messed with so badly, it makes it very difficult to recover. I’m open and honest with my boyfriend now and he is so patient and understanding. I don’t go through his stuff because I don’t feel the need to, but sometimes I get in my head and wonder.   TL; DR Got messed up pretty badly by my ex who was dishonest, now I have trouble with trust in my current relationship."

I had a problem with this for quite some time. There is an undeniable intensity when looking into someone's eyes.  You just need to be honest with what you're communicating and people wil respond favourably.  It takes time and practice but it is definetly possible.

"The important question is *why* they are insecure, and it usually comes down to being the target of abuse. But instead of attacking the abusers, everyone faults the insecure - which traumatizes them even further, while the abuser is ignored and goes on to abuse more people.  If we focused more on the people who *cause* insecurity, than on insecure people themselves, there would be less insecure people. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

I'm insecure about this.  I always try to find a story in my life that relates to one someone else is telling and I feel like I'm a one-upper by accident sometimes.  For example if someone is talking about a topic I'm passionate about like video games or basketball I can't help but share my experiences and sometimes I feel like a douche.   Especially with video games. I've played a number of FPS's at a high level competitively and I sometimes get carried about talking about it with someone in person.

One was an infant and one of them was in the same school as my brother who was 11 years old at the time. I don't remember how the conversation started but it kind of went like this:  My mum: Yeah I remember when my son was a baby. I used to buy ""X"" baby formula for him which was good when he was struggling to feed.  Young woman: Oh I don't buy that cheap formula. I only buy the expensive one because I don't want to buy cheap things for my baby.  My mum: ...umm....? The one I used to buy was the only one on the market at the time but okay..."

How do you shut up people who do this?
"I dont think any one thing screams "" I'm insecure"". Its culmination of things. It can be seen in body language, the way you speak about yourself and others, your past relationships etc.    I think a better question would be ""how do I be less insecure"".   If that was asked I would say love who you are and where you are and dive deep into personal development."

"Can confirm: was once in a shit relationship, and any time things were good or even just looked good I was so relieved and delirious that I'd post about it. He and I did a lot of cool stuff together, so we looked great, but typically several huge fights were had or I was pasting on a smile so as not to ""ruin things"" even though I'd just found out something awful. Now I'm in a ridiculously happy/equal marriage, and I actually feel *guilty* about it a little, like if I told everybody how awesome things are all the time I'd just be rubbing their faces in how good I have it, so I'm mostly super quiet about my family life on social media. (Except just now, when I brag on reddit)  In a sad related note, when things are really rough with my kid (we have completely opposite personalities, which creates quite a bit of frustration and conflict), I find myself posting more stuff about her, too... almost like I feel guilty for being at the end of my rope, so I make up for it by publicly remembering the things I love about her or sharing a happy, cute memory. Kind of an interesting insight in to all the mommy bragging referenced in other comments... those are probably the moms not getting any sleep or support and really not enjoying parenting.   Smarm alert: it's easy to focus on how annoying others' insecurities are when they present like this, but it's actually super sad to think about all these people who dislike themselves and their lives enough to act this way."
"Trying to adapt your style, mannerisms, behavior from others, asking blunt questions like ""Do you have to put a lot of time into your hair to get it like that.""

So naturally, Upsy-daisy has to one up this as well and he goes *oh man I totally got my ass whopped by this guy the other day, I nearly died*  No one wants to talk to him man.

But my brother's wife had also died a week earlier and he went through a serious mental health breakdown and the next day checked himself into a psychiatric hospital. He's much better now but that video will always be online.  Fortunately no one ever linked his name to the video so it's not like everyone who googles him finds it, but still. The video is out there and so are comments like, ""This guy is the world's biggest asshole! I wish someone had kicked his ass!"" and ""Fuck this piece of shit!""

"I've thought long and hard whether to post this, but I figured why the hell not, worse case scenario it doesn't work for you.   I can honestly say I've found the solution to this in religion (Christianity to be specific). But I'm not here to sell you on religion. I realized the past few months that Christianity is actually a very ""practical"" belief, in the sense that it challenges every thought I have. So if ever I think ""I'm such a failure"" I need to instantly remind myself that I have a purpose in life. Because that's what my belief says.   If you think about it, every feeling we have, be it joy, sadness, insecurity, etc. comes from certain things we accept as the truth.   You're happy because you just won first place in a competition. (valid)    You're sad because your pet died. (valid)    You're insecure because you think you're defined by your career, and it's not going well. (invalid)  A truth dictates on how you feel about _anything_.   If I tell you your house burned down you'd probably be shocked, scared, anxiety would hit, unless you happened to be standing in your house at that moment. You see how the truth is being in your house instantly invalidated the other negative feelings?  And the problem is that often some of these truths are defined in terms of external things. I'm successful if I have a good career, I'm ugly because no girl likes me, etc. But all self worth should come from within. And if there's one person on this planet that should ALWAYS be positive about yourself, it's you. Positivism doesn't cost anything, except for some ""mental retraining"". Don't see failures as failures, but ask yourself how could that have gone better, and see it as a learning opportunity. And just like this example, there is _always_ a positive way to look at any issue you have with your life. Lie to yourself if you have to. If God doesn't exist that's exactly what I'm doing with myself. And I can tell you it works.   So what you need to do is find a different set of truths, and train yourself to believe it by forcing yourself to believe it. You basically have to talk to yourself a lot, and basically have fights with your brain. I know it sounds crazy. This is also the hard part. But by believing a truth that is more positive about yourself, you'll be happier (less negative emotions), and therefore have more faith in that belief. It's basically a Pavlovian reaction.   I really really do hope it can help you!   Be blessed with inner peace.   P.S. If anyone is interested in the list of Biblical truths that helped me find this inner peace you can drop me a PM."

And for a while, I tried to shift by just smiling and saying thanks, without adding a negative comment about myself or finding something to compliment them on. Just accepting it. And it is weird how it changes your perspective.  Nowadays, if I’m genuinely touched by a compliment, I say that too. So if someone says my hair looks good, I might say “Thanks!”, then add: “I appreciate it!” Or “I really needed that!” Or “that means a lot!” Or “You just made my day :)”     That last one’s my favorite - to say and to hear. Nothing better than someone making someone’s day! Lol."

"I used to work in foodservice for a long time, and there's one thing I've noticed that screams ""I'm insecure as fuck"" among customers, especially the men.  I'd see booth tables occupied by couples, and normally a couple would sit facing each other. Occasionally, I'd see a couple sitting together on the same side while the opposite seat was empty - along with the guy emitting ""don't you even dare look at my woman"" vibes at any guy that happens to look their way. And yes, they tend to be the overly-macho alpha type of guys.  Seriously, dude... stop being so insecure. I'm betting these guys are very controlling of their women, maybe even abusive."

What I can do is demonstrate clear negations of your claim, like someone with low self esteem who doesn't believe they're worthy of judging others, but if you expect me to prove the null hypothesis then once again your epistemology is flawed.  the grounds that you want to point to are not justification for accepting the claim, all you can reasonably hold to is ""I don't know"", not ""I don't know, but until I do this is what I'm going with"". You would be in the position of accepted dozens of contradictory claims if you did that."

"I had a girl do this to me over the past 3 years at my uni because when we started I was getting popular, I had a lot of influence over my peers and obtained a very important position in the student council. She started spreading rumours that I bullied her and started fake rumours about herself and said that I spread them. It was awful.   Almost the moment I met her, I knew what type of person she was. She came across as very attention seeking and at first I'd give her the attention but when I stopped doing that, other people followed so she started trying to bring my reputation down.   You'd think this sort of thing stops in school but nope, even grown adults behave like this."

"This used to be me. Got the question,""what do you do?"". And I'd always lie and say art or reading. While the reading was true, it didn't take up nearly as much of my life as gaming did, which I was sort of embarrassed to mention in more professional settings. I fixed this by actually getting into art and spending more time reading again. Though I don't think I should have felt bad for playing video games, I feel that my hobbies now are something I can be satisfied with and also achieve something."
"sometimes saying, “you can do ______ better than me!” and it makes people think less of you because they think you’re asking for attention. (Dunno if this is insecure? I do it a lot to make other people feel better. It works sometimes)"
"Kind of devils advocate here, but I’m always skeptical of guys around my girlfriend, unless I know them. Not that I’m a weirdo about it, but I know the intentions of a guy, because I am one. Not that my girlfriend would cheat on me, but I know half these dudes are thirsty as fuck. Maybe that makes me insecure, I’m not really sure."

Putting yourself down for humor is fine. It’s the comparison to others that’s the problem. Self deprecating humor can make a whole room feel less bad about their own insecurities and liven up the party. It really helps if it’s relatable.

So I dont actually want to get involved in this whole argument you teo have got going on but but I did want mention that IQ is actually kinda meaningless. Dont get me wrong the individual score is an indicator of how people rate in certain aspects of intelligence but a standard IQ test is not a predictor of success nor does it actually rate all types of intelligence or even calculate an individuals full brain power potential.
Constantly comparing yourself to others or being unable to speak to others because of feeling inferior to them in my opinion

"I did this a lot when I was younger for the same reason. I was teased by my peers about my physical appearance and not having the means to buy nice clothes like other kids brought up in affluence. I was also too nice/timid to stand up for myself when being bullied and when kids smell blood in the water it can get pretty rough. This, coupled with my dad regularly cutting into my confidence about everything from my intelligence to my inability to swing a hammer “as well as a boy could” at age 10, lead to heaps of insecurity from and early age. I began lying (about dumb shit) to appear cooler than I was to fit in better socially but I would frequently be caught out. I could also tell the future success of a friendship by how much lying I did to make them think I was cool. If I didn’t feel the need to lie up a storm right from the beginning, it was more likely to work out long term.   Luckily, I had a very kind and supportive mom and sister that helped me have more confidence in myself. Now that I’m in my mid-thirties I’m horrified by my past behavior and try to surround myself with people that are as honest and authentic as possible to help encourage me to stay on the right path, but I still feel the same pangs of insecurity from time to time. Amazing how those past experiences can affect us even as our “confident” adult selves."

What you didn’t want me to know you were getting it?   Me: uhhh no you were just backing up the car so I had a second....  Ex bf: You ALWAYS tell me when you are going to grab your gym bag. You purposely went and grabbed it when I wasn’t looking.   Me: Im not understanding the issue, are you concerned I am hiding something? Would you like to look in my gym bag?   Ex bf: No it’s just fucking shady that you went over there and grabbed it without saying anything. Next time you fucking tell me when are you going to get something from your car.

"huge difference between a competitive nature and narcissism. Luckily this example can help me illustrate the difference. When you are competitive you want to be the victor, it can be toxic if you want to win so bad at stuff that doesn't matter (baby weight) or are willing to lie/bend rules to create victory or discredit a loss.              Narcissism is on display, in my non-medical opinion, when someone will say or do anything to be the center of attention. They are constantly thinking of how they can interject somehow to become the center of attention. Someone competitive wouldn't mention someone else's kid unless they helped raise it. A narcissist will bring up a friend's kid because the source doesn't matter.              Confusion and derisiveness can even feed the narcissist if they interpret that as disappointment that you aren't the center of attention. Projection is the name of the game with those people and if you don't live like them you must be jealous.              Signed the competitive, suspected narcissist."

Our relationship didn't last long, you'll be shocked to hear, but unfortunately for the months it lasted I let it happen and ended up feeling like an idiot most of the time. Now I realise he was insecure and couldn't handle a woman knowing more than him, but the worst thing about dealing with that from my first ever boyfriend aged 19 is that it created insecurities in me.

I frequently exhibit the fundamental attribution error (anything bad I do is because of circumstances, anything bad you do is because your are bad). And I often place my own self interests above anything.   Again, I agree with the fact that these are negative qualities, I am working on it, and I have a lot of work to do. Overconfidence does not improve my life, it is a challenge.

"Knew someone like this. No matter how hard you tried, you couldn't nicely tell him to leave you alone. He would follow me and distract me with talking about himself and how shitty things were. Even if I was having a really stressful semester, he wouldn't really ask how I was. He would always dominate every conversation."
Of course.

This is exactly what Covert Narcissism is all about.  It sounds like an oxymoron but you can be an unconfident introvert and a complete narcissist.  It is much much harder to see it for what it is.

"Not the original person, but I think it's more common in fields where academia in the primary career path, and there are few options in industry or government.   I'm in ecology/environmental science and I'd saw most people get work experience before a PhD, or at least a masters."
Lmao. Yikes ^
"People who oversell how good things are for them. I work with a women who says things like:  ""My son interviewed for a position and they loved him, he was exactly what they were looking for. He's doing such and such, practicality running the place. He's basically the boss."" We pulled up the job ad, he's the receptionist.  ""I'm a trained cook, just amazing. I make awesome food all the time."" Then she eats prepackaged frozen crap everyday for lunch and eats fast food most nights.  ""My other son is so smart and artistic. He's doing so well in university."" Flunked out.  ""My husband and I are so in love and amazing."" They only take seperate trips and vacations.  ""I'm a spectacular artist, truely gifted."" Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but no.  Just be realistic. We can see through you."

"I'm sure he meant 360 actually. He probably envisioned his car doing one complete revolution quickly and cleanly, so he maintains he direction and some of the speed he had. The dirt he kicked up makes the cops lose visibility, so Joey figures he can keep spinning to make a very long stretch of road have poor visibility.  Why Joey is an idiot:Intentionally doing a 360 and maintaining speed is impossible, he cant maintain control on the road doing that, 360s take more room than a dirt road typically has, tires will bite into the ground when spinning sideways as opposed to sliding, doing multiple 360s over and over down a stretch of road would take forever, cops just dont give up on losing visibility, high speed chases involve helicopters and/or other methods of spotting,"
"Probably going to be downvoted, but I feel like most people with visible tattoos, piercings (outside regular ears), and unnatural hair colors.

"Right? My newest baby is 6, almost 7 months and the most she will do is roll. My middle child was crawling and pulling up at this age and walking right after she turned 9 months. I cannot even imagine my 6 month old crawling much less pulling up and walking in 3 months. 😆 All kids are different, I'm not doing anything different with this girl than I did with my older daughter. Kids are just different and learn at their own pace. And in a couple years when they are running around playing, you won't be able to tell which one was walking at an earlier age"

"NEEDING validation from EVERYONE.  It is NOT mandatory for us to be friends just because you hang out with my bf.  Being overly sensitive about EVERYTHING.  COMPLAINING to my bf about how desperate you are for my validation even though I don’t know you?  Trying to get me to like you and approve of you, for example, giving me offhanded compliments to try and get on my good side.  Sorry hun but school is for studying and well.. school work. I graduate this year and if I’m having an anxiety attack while trying to concentrate on my grades then I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t always want to socialize and that’s just that. It’s seriously nothing personal against you ok?"
"Mmm... something I do sometimes and I do it without realizing until someone tells me... I, many times, take away value of what I do, like my job, and I have a hard time when I do errors in my job, sometimes I'm really hard to myself! I hate let down people, specially my bosses and colleagues!  This come from my  parents that used to critizise everything I did, they always had high expectations for me, but they stopped doing that when I was pre-teen because they realize the damage they were doing, and all the bullying I got in School, I was at the bottom of the castle system in School so no matter what I did or what I said I was seen as a nobody... teachers didn't help at all, a teacher asked me to stop drawing that good because the other kids felt bad and they ignored the bullying!"

"I was accused of doing this but ironically see it as insecurity on the part of the accuser. Like, sorry Will but you told a story about a time you were in a car wreck, then I also told a story about a time I was in a car wreck. Sharing a similar story isn’t the same as one-upping."

"My current roommate does this with every conversation. It has gotten to the point that I can be talking with my other roommate and she walks in to interrupt with something about herself that is in no way connected to the original conversation. So it isn't even a ""oh I had that happen once"" type thing she just jumps into the conversation with something random and sometimes in the middle of one of our sentences."

"I was very insecure when i was younger and still am. My primary school was pretty small and only had one class per year. When we got to year 6 (when you take your SATS to see where you will be placed in secondary school) i was thrown in the psecial “smart kids” class. This for some reason made me feel INCREDIBLY insecure when i moved up to secondary school because i was in a class with entirely smart people and not just the 4/5 others in my old school. I allways had to be the best. Not in a braggy lind of way i was actually very private with my grades and test scores. I just felt such envy and so ashamed of myself that i wasnt as good / better than them. I was constantly comparing myself to others which is an awfull habbit to get into. It didnt help that at the time i also essentially became the person that everyone in the class made snarky remarks at and it became widley accepted in that class that i was the person at the butt of everyones “jokes”. This just led me down a horrible spiral of constanly comparing myself to others, setting myself an impossible standard and almost conplete isolation. Thankfully now that im in y10 (this all happened in years 7 through 9) im in a different class and doing much better. Im getting better at not comparing myself to others and just thinking “i revised for this test. There js nothing more i could have done. I did my best”. This really helped me. To anyone feeling insecure or constantly comparing themselves to others or anything else, just know that eventually you can get away from that toxic thinking and from those toxic people. You are loved and valid. 🧡"

That is a really cool idea and very insightful. Thanks for posting it.
"Insecure. Hmm. I've trained myself, after a lot of bullying and abuse as a child, to be more extroverted at social gatherings. And everytime I make a joke or share an anecdote, I'm paralyzed with fear that nobody will laugh or understand it. And even if they do, it doesn't register. I'm already thinking about how they like me so far but one wrong move and they'll hate me and never invite me again. The answer to your question sir, is mind-numbing anxiety, the likes of which can never be apparent to the naked eye. And it's painful. It's torture. It's just sad."

"Also have done this and recognized how foolish it is. Now when I'm feeling very low, I message friends asking them if they have any good news to share. It helps because they talk with me and I don't feel as alone, but the conversation isn't all about how depressed I feel (which would make me feel guilty)."

"That's an excellent question, I mean, these are the kinds of questions who will tell who is worth my time. Like my friend James, he is an expert at answering these kinds of questions and will always ask the best people in the world these kinds of questions. The people James knows are the same people I know so when James asked me this question, I told him exactly what I thought. James was stunned. Right now, James is putting together a book about this question because he knows the world leaders in this field and will only write a book when he knows it will be a best seller that speaks on only the most important things in the world."
Constantly bringing up ex significant others or friends to laugh about “How much better off” you are or how “It’s their loss”.
This resonates real hard
Can relate so much to this
"On this vein, when we are promoted at my work we go into a class of sorts for a few weeks. A friend of mine in this class (who has told me he is very insecure) is absolutely intolerable. Smart guy, buy he turns the class into a big show to prove how smart he is. Meanwhile people struggling in the class obviously don't benefit from his showboating at all. As a class we reviewed a recording of him talking with a client and gave him pointers. He hasn't spoken in three days.   (bought the teacher a beer after work last week and asked for his thoughts, he confidently expressed that because this guy is not coachable he is about to hit a glass ceiling)"
“i’m gonna beat your ass”
"Daily selfie uploads. Some think it reflects confidence in others but I see it as they need approval and likes to feel good about themselves. There's this one girl I know who posts a picture of herself almost every day and gets a decent amount of attention, but in person she is super reclusive and what seems to be insecure."
"My husband doesn't like Facebook, but he has family that lives far away, and co-workers that will message him on FB if they can't get ahold of him on his phone. So he told me to just add his name onto my account because he refused to make his own 🤷"

"I’m really insecure as well- do you find it hard to say someone’s name when greeting them, like “hey x, how’s it going?” I’ve always struggled with this."
I believe what makes me insecure is partly being too harsh on myself when self reflecting

Everything about me
I’m so insecure I don’t have a Facebook page and I currently have 399 replies I haven’t looked at here on Reddit. I rarely respond because I can’t stand to read anything anyone says to/about me. That’s insecurity. The person you described is my SIL who loves attention. She always posts shit then is vague about it when anyone inquires. Drama queen.

You probably have a vitamin D deficiency.  You need that to produce sufficient serotonin which controls those sorts of behaviors.
Trolling
"Great, now I know my problem.   How can I get rid of this?"
Even worse: two-upping people constantly!
For me is staying quiet bc I feel like people dont care for what I have to say because I feel like I have a boring personality.  Turning down invitations to group activities (or any other friendly action) because u feel like they do it out of courtesy.

"When the person screams ""I'm very insecure!"""
"My face screams I'm insecure.  I can't always read people well, so it's easy to alienate me. I get anxious when people are angry because typically that anger has been directed at me. I admit my mistakes, so when there is one I don't admit to it means I had no fault in it. Doesn't mean people don't angrily throw the blame my way.  I don't know how to form new friendships with people very well and I have loneliness and depression, so I always assume I'm awkward or weird or people don't like me until it's in my face obvious. (Sidenote, I have some aspergers tendancies, and was raised with a sibling with a confirmed diagnosis  of aspergers.)  I constantly feel inferior and just don't know how to get over it."
Those “IG models” who post selfies on the daily of caked on bronzer highlighter contour and whatever else for the “natural” look
"I have this habit of automatically glancing away every time someone around me drops something or makes some other innocuous mistake, because when I make a mistake the last thing I want is for other people staring at me and paying an excessive amount of attention to me.  Of course, automatically looking away looks just as bad, but that's my ingrained habit.    It takes me a moment or so to collect myself and go back to help someone pick up their spilled items or whatnot.    I'm also afraid that whoever dropped something or tripped will yell at me for watching, or for distracting them or getting in their way.  Nobody at work ever has, so that fear has receded a tiny bit, but is still there."

Bro but I do bother other people when when I start to talk too much
Do people often ask you to tell stories or is it the typical whoever starts a good story will set the flow of conversation? I find it so much easier to talk about things when people ask me about stuff
Owning a truck and talking about how everyone else on the road are have little bitch/pussy cars and making points that revolve around that fact that because you have a big truck you are a bigger man. Especially if it's lifted or has those annoying black smoke spewing mufflers.

"I often can't look people in the eyes either, but I don't really know where that's coming from. My eyes are usually pretty dry and they start tearing up a bit when I look at people. If they're not dry I have no problem looking at people, but it does make me a little insecure in that I'm worried people will think I'm insecure if I can't look them in the eyes."

"My gf does it constantly, but for good reason.  I had sex with a dude while our relationship was totalled/on the rocks/in a bad way. I thought we werent together and she thought we were. Then I hid the sex thing because it became apparent she thought *were* in a relationship, which meant I had done a really bad thing. Then I ended up telling her about it when she started asking questions. And it's actually worse than what I've written here, but I dont wanna put all the details down because its complicated as fuck.   Of course all trust was lost after that, I'm trying my best to rebuild it.  I feel like the worst person on earth whenever I think about it. Shes such an amazing person and doesng deserve that pain."
Passive aggression...its like you aren't confident enough to address the things that are bothering you but you can definitely make everyone else in the room incredibly uncomfortable.
Lately my mom repeats entire sentences I say in conversation like immediately after I said it. It's super awkward. I'm like yeah I agree cause that's what I just said. She's always taking a normal conversation and amping it up into some major deal when whatever it is is totally not a huge deal. I find myself completely exhausted after being around her. It sucks because I care about her while also being 100% annoyed as hell in her presence.

Being very verbally jealous of your partner/spouse/gf/friends hanging out with other people just because they are of the gender you're attracted to.
Oh no 😱
People who use reddit
Sometimes I feel like I talk about myself too much and I try to stop but realize all my stories are about me and I get sad because I realize it's probably annoying everyone else. So that just makes me not talk much about myself to friends or family.
What
"Ricky henderson was boarding a team bus.  A veteran told a rookie not to sit in the front seat   it's  for ricky, he has tenure. Ricky says what you talking about, i have 15 year."
I'm feeling personally attacked.
"I’m probably too late for this thread but when I was a freshman in college I had to share a dorm room with this classic redneck. I didn’t mind him too much, he was really unhygienic and smelled but my favorite part about him was on the weekends he would leave to go visit his girlfriend, giving me the whole dorm room to myself.  Anyway, one morning I was checking emails and drinking coffee before my classes while he was still asleep until all of a sudden he burst awake. He immediately called his girlfriend and yelled “Are you cheating on me!? Are you cheating on me!?” Then before she had much time to respond immediately followed it with “I dreamed you were cheating on me because I have a small penis!”  It took everything I had to not spit my coffee out and pretend I didn’t hear him.  He was your classic big diesel truck compensating country boy."
Would I Lie To You is basically this.
People who never lock their doors are pretty insecure.
"Dude, with that attitude, you won't have anything BUT success. Thanks for making my day."
"When my son was born I was signed up to that baby center thing that sends out milestone emails. As a new father I wanted to know as much as possible about being a dad.  Then I found the forums.  My god.  All these parents bragging about how their 2 year old is reciting old Feynman YouTube interviews.  So I decided to post crazy shit....pure bullshit like, "" so little Timmy has learned Latin. Reading Cicero today and over his cereal he began discussing the scandal when Clodius Pulcher went in drag to witness the Bona Dea. I was so impressed but he kept slipping into Latin often and I lost him after he explained how Milo and his gladiator thugs ended up killing Pulcher on the Appian Way.""  It was obviously a joke but so many parents commented as if they believed a 4 year old read Cicero and Virgil in Latin and was an authority of the politics of the Late Republic.  And a few even bullshited that their children were also learning Latin. I decided to go this route after reading about how many of their kids knew 3 or 4 languages already.  But of course my son didnt read Latin....it was Aramaic and Greek."
That's what social media is for a lot of people. It's a soapbox used by people to project an imagine of how good of person they are or how perfect their life is.
"I don't trust the judgement of anyone who finds my physical appearance, in a thong, attractive."
"I'm not religious here, but even I can't find a common denomination"
"Yes. I don’t do it nearly as often now because I’m happier, more content, and obviously, more secure in who I am. But when I was in high school and college... I felt like I had to do this all the time. Always have a better story. Always have something ready to make sure people would like me and think I was cool."
Guess it depends on how they come across. I'm always willing to learn new things but not if someone is aggressively calling me an idiot :P

"Is school really important for your discipline? I've never got the sense that it really matters where you go for grad school as long as it's a research university. Sure, going to Harvard or Yale might be more prestigious, but I never thought people cared much otherwise."

Yeah no I don't word things nicely like that but I do try and be discreet. If it's something they can't fix then I won't point it out because it's like what can they do.

"Probably obvious, but those people on Twitter or other Social Media that spend most of their time trying to beat down others or bring them down to their level simply for having a differing opinion. Not only does it tend to make them seem insecure, but it makes them come across as insecure and unsure of their own stance in whatever argument they're taking part in."
"Not understanding why women have many relationships throughout their life, even if they’re being abused"
"Yeah and the Ones who who always Tweet stuff like, I was so brave Today when I saved that Turtle from being run over, and spilled my Starbucks in the process.  Those are the ones who end up in YouTube Cringe videos later in life complaining about Hula Dashboard doll idols"
Constantly bragging about how smart you are.

"Starting any internet rant with ""I'm not a _________ but ..."" If you have to establish your bonifides before anything that comes out of your mouth/keyboard there's a pretty good chance that you actually are that thing but lack the courage to own and admit it."
"Employee lies constantly.  Like ""I can see farther/ hear better than any person on earth"" type lies. He's also the best at everything ever and is a MENSA member and a representative of some major company but still works for me. I get that it stems from insecurity and wanting to be accepted but come on, homie. We love you. We accept you. Just ease up on the bullshit."
Committed crimes? What?
Ur a good person
"Dude, here’s my shitty advice. Find a hobby to do instead of stress eating. Find a physical activity you enjoy doing. Mines walking, and if you start up slow and build up as you go, I used to only get like 4 kilometers a day, now I sometimes get 14 kilometers. If you’re interested, we could start a fitness group chat, to keep up with each other’s daily exercise."
Staring awkwardly deep into someone’s eyes and then just keep staring for good 5 minutes. Usually it’s a hint that the other person should leave and will go away.  Now you never have to deal with that problem :D
Big truck.
Sounds like a lot of anxiety. I think the insecurity OP is getting at is that mask of false confidence and bravado. Like beep beep look at my giant loud AF Truck with the nuts and the flames and muffler loudener.
"Some people get mad at people just for having money or being attractive. If you weren’t complaining about them constantly, you’d probably be pretty successful yourself."
Being mean to people on the Internet because it’s anonymous. This is everywhere but it bothers me the most on Reddit.

"There is also a correlation between costs of weddings and divorce rates. The more expensive a wedding is, the more likely the couple will divorce. I guess it could be related. The more flashy you are with your wedding and the more you want to show off, the more insecure you are in your relationship."

"When people, usually older generations, throw incredibly harsh criticism towards people about things like fashion sense. I have heard my father for instance talking very passionately about how ugly nose rings are and growing up I have asked to dye my hair and his response was always “it would look terrible” or “people will think your gay” to clarify I am bisexual and my fashion sense is pretty standard, in fact I usually prefer to dress and carry myself professionally, however my father has the disposition that if I dye a tasteful bit of color into my hair to express myself, I have suddenly joined the dark side."

Talking too much
"Actually that happened to me, kind of. I lived with my aunt for awhile because their house was closer to my school. My aunt is only woman in her family, she and my guy cousins especially though tolerant of my uncle aren't overly fond of him either. She had to visit relatives in another country. My parents, aunt, and eldest cousin all told me to stay at my parent's place while she wasn't home for my own safety."

"Serious: I think it's sad that people constantly need reassurance to maintain themselves, for example I've seen close friends do this on a daily basis only to see they're barely getting my mentally. So I'm lucky that I can simply deny and ignore any of others opinions that may seem harmful to my mental state, whereas others aren't...  Otherwise if you didn't mean that, you're very funny."

I can’t tell if this is sarcasm
"I am guilty of this myself. It's in part due to the fact that I married an extraordinary person and work with extraordinary people. They are all so amazing that I'm certain they just bear with me while I catch up, which also proves that they're patient. I try my best to be more like them, but my opinion of them comes out as both self deprecation and compliments of their objective awesomeness in the form of calling out awesome things they do as awesome.        I keep telling myself that others must feel this way too, but I'm not convinced. So you're not wrong, but it also sucks to hear it."
Constantly apologizing for little mistakes.
Honestly most people don’t notice. If you’re making the effort to be engaged then I highly doubt they will accuse you of “hey why are you looking at my ear?” Bridge of nose works too. Do it as much as you need

He lied and cheated multiple times, the last incident was the worst, he hid his phone inside his underwear at night while we sleep.

"You’re exactly right, the rigor of the institution from an undergraduate perspective has no bearing on its value as a graduate university. But not a lot of people who haven’t been to, or at least considered, a research university really know that. It’s definitely a jolt for some family friends to hear I went from a well-ranked undergrad institution and a prestigious internship to ASU, but its only because they don’t know how different it is between the worlds of being an undergrad vs a researcher. I will say that private schools and especially prestigious private schools have more money to throw at their students and the nature of ASU being public means we make way less money and have to jump through hoops for things that are guaranteed other places, but the education itself is very good."

"I initially read this as you being a guy. I was really, really confused for a second."
I know someone like this. We had a large friend group in varsity. One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet had one of the worst girlfriends. No one liked her but because we all loved him we put up with her. Another friend of ours struggled with severe health issues that she never fully spoke about. She'd be in and out of hospitals for weeks at a time. One time after she'd been in the hospital for just over a week she came back to campus and when we asked her how she was she said better but she had a really tough week of tests such as a colonscopy etc. The girlfriend responded by saying that she completely understands because she had a rough week too because she had the flu.... The look on all of our faces....  Well after years of friendship we realized that's she's worse in large groups but fine when it's just a few people hanging out. Clearly very insecure and always feels the need to stand out or one up in groups setting.  They're getting married next year.

Never agreeing on something that is obviously believable
"Those poor kids need to realize, it's no different than bragging about starving yourself or bragging about dehydrating yourself. It's self-harm. Sleep is vital for health. Fight for it like you fight to be fed and fight to drink water.  You aren't superhuman or special because you forced your body to compensate for you abusing it. Your body can withstand some punishment, but it comes at a cost. The movers and shakers of the world, they take care of themselves, so they can tackle problems at the height of their potential.   I wish those kids would brag about how well they take care of themselves instead, if they're going to brag about something like that. Or even better, brag about taking care of themselves and helping out others who are struggling to take care of themselves."

"Agreed, you don't have to justify your claim, it just makes you unreasonable.  &gt; Someone with low self esteem will think the way to feeling better about themselves is to put down others. Someone with high self esteem will not feel threatened by the talents or successes of others and instead will try to boost the self esteem of others around them.  These two sentences are unjustified, I've said I don't care about absolute certainty, I care about justification. I also don't know why you think I meant you said others would be justified, I was telling you that they wouldn't be justified, and neither are you.   &gt;  I did not say that you have to answer for any of my experiences  So why on earth would you say:  &gt; Mine may be true or false, and you don’t have the answer to that either.  as if because I can't tell you whether it's true or false, you can hold whichever position you like. You haven't said yes to me, or agreed with me, you've implied repeatedly that you're not worried about where your view is justified, you're just going to hold it.  I really don't care if I come off as a tit to you. I want to know about whether you care if your beliefs are actually true, and so far you've said you'll just go with what you reckon until someone proves otherwise."

"I feel that too, if I have a story to say abiut myself or say something I'm gonna do if its from cuttung my hair or going shopping I feel like ny friends will think I'm puttung it all the attentuon on me."
"This. I feel like I'm one-upping sometimes but I don't mean it, I'm just giving my perspective and then after I realize like ""oh, am I one-upping the conversation?"""
Same with reddit and any other social media.
"I think you're confusing what's meant by ""one-upping"".  It's not just engaging in conversation by adding your own anecdote or telling a related story, it's when people actually take something you've said and then specifically attempt to insert themselves into the thing in a superior way. ""Oh, you once served Mel Gibson in a restaurant? That's cool! I once served Tom Cruise and we became friends and he now sends me a cake every Christmas."""

When somebody posts a question to see if they have any tells that make them look insecure.
"What are mlm's, can't think rn? I'm not dumb! AND I'M NOT INSECURE!!! People that snap for no reason at all whatsoever are usually pretty insecure. But seriously though what are MLM's? Mama's Lovely Medicine?"
I always try to tell jokes or make light out of situations. The way I see it if someone won’t like me for my body or personality I could at least make them smile or laugh and make their day a little brighter and then whenever they think of me it would be a positive thought.
Hol up in high school? I assumed you were talking about college where that attitude is fairly common. High school is a whole other level of unhealthy

"That's one of my biggest pet peeves, but in a bit of a different context. I've been through a lot over the years, personally and professionally. Dealing with grief, and in some cases some PTSD situations brought on by work, can be very frustrating when everyone who says ""I'm here if you need anything"", goes on to tell me how they also lost a family member, or dealt with a difficult situation. You know what? I don't care. I want you to listen to me...not tell me your tale of woe. I understand you can relate, but shut up.   Maybe that's not insecurity, and more of people not knowing how to deal with things like that, but it always strikes me as a bit of one upping. Oh you lost your dad? So did I and my dad was much sicker for much longer. Unfortunately that just leads to things getting pushed down inside and locked away to make the ulcers get bigger and the stress more overwhelming."
Literally anything Donald Trump says
"Confident, mostly secure person here. I look at you and think the same thing.  Id probably mistake your insecure silence as being confident and reserved. I'd envy your ability to be so chill because I always feel like I have to perform in social situations by talking and making connections, because if I don't I'll just be alone and miserable.  Everybody is scared, man. Even confident people are scared, they just know how to engage their fears.  People rarely see the worst in others right off the bat."

Could be intentionally foreshadowing that he isn't the person he makes himself out to be.
"Oh man, am I late. But I have a few.  People who are needlessly critical of *everything.* And I mean absolutely everything they can possibly think of. They have no praise for anyone or anything at all, just bitter criticism and insults.   People who also cannot be happy for anyone else and their achievements.   Related to the above, people who can't support anyone else in achieving, well, anything for their lives because they're just going to fail, or be absolutely pointless.   People who are unable to even be happy for themselves or aspire to anything without attacking everyone else and their choices.   This level of insecurity is why I ran away from my fuckhole town screaming. I'm pretty insecure too but I keep that shit to myself and don't try to drag an entire fucking county down with me."

"I'm pretty insecure about everything. I can't look people in the eyes, I've tried but I wander and focus on something else to concentrate on what I'm saying. I talk about myself too much, I don't exactly one up people, but I feel like I do For example they'd say ""I got 3 hours of sleep last night "" and I'd casually say ""damn, I got 2 because I was up all night finishing homework"" I don't realize I'm doing it until after our conversation. Another dumb thing I do is if a conversation didn't go how I wanted it to I pretend something else was said to make myself feel better, and not gonna lie it works"

"When people have to continually say how awesome they are in situations.  Or how many times they were so tough they were able to calmly say to someone that a fight will happen if the other person doesnt back down.  When someone has to continually say shit about their job and how ""lost"" their job would be without them there....like buddy,  your a specialist at Lowes....you are replaceable, pretty quickly.  I dont mean to talk down on people working those jobs.  I just think when people can only talk about how important they are, screams that they need validation of that fact, and will get it anyway they can."

"Being overly needed like calling, or texting someone too much. What most of us need to realize is that the most put together person suffer from insecurities. Everyone gets embarassed, feel alone and or lonely, feel inadequate, even super models. So, once you get this in your mind you should try to not feel so insecure, because as humans no one is exempted from these feelings. No matter how much they tell you  they're not.  Find an outlet just between you and yourself that makes you feel good, helping others, giving a good word to someone, donating to a good cause (anonymously). Try not to seek validity via another human, if you do you put too much of your power control  into an entity who is constantly changing and  temporary, and that's not fair to you or your value system and uniquness. Hope this helps."
"People who have such strong opinions about people they don't even know. Example: Kardashians, Logan Paul, (insert more controversial famous people), etc.   Like they pretend they know these people (in and out) and can't understand that there's a massive public facade. They get triggered and so emotionally invested and like to argue (especially on the internet) about how he/her is so and so, and they just love to talk about how much they dislike these people.

If it's a message from someone I know, I'll ask her what they're chatting about.  I sometimes worry that this isn't a healthy thing, but I feel I do it for good reason.   I check it so she doesn't have to stop what she's doing if it's a stupid notification, and I ask what their convo's are about because I'm interested in what she's got going on (she only tends to message people to make plans that often include me), she doesn't mind, but I see posts like this and worry that it might be an unhealthy/insecure habit, even though I don't do it to spy."

"This is exactly why I don't talk about how many models I've banged or how much I like threesomes (MFF to be clear--and I'm the dude). I also don't tell people about how easily I get chicks into bed--like why would I brag about how I can have them fondling the inside of my pockets within 10 minutes of meeting them? That's just immature.  I'm not gonna go out there and make other guys feel bad about how much of the market I'm banging--did I ever tell you about how I had an affair with Jennifer something from Hollywood? It was a while back, so I don't remember her last name, but it was during the peak of her career.  There's no sense in bragging about that kind of stuff--it also makes women feel like they're only worth something of value through their bodies via my humongous dong--which is something I also don't talk about at parties--it's like I always say, I let my actions do the walking, and my walking gets me action; but, I don't say it like that, that's just rude.  Anyway, I gotta roll I have a meet up with two of my female friends, one is on a TV show, but I shouldn't say which one and the other, from what I hear, likes me--I don't know, I don't like to talk about that kind of stuff, you know?

"This is what happened to my best friend. He suspected his gf of 4 years of cheating but could never prove it. He just had a feeling and he would take it out on her( without proof, perhaps it was cruel). She would come crying to me multiple times saying saying how he was emotionally abusing her by claiming she was cheating and yet she wouldn't break up with him. This went on a year. Then one day he reads her Facebook messages. Turns out she was cheating on him for two years and that he had every right to be suspicious. Now he has serious trust issues with women (obviously I hope he over comes it). Cheating is horrible."
"same. Not really on the problem part, but on getting the ""how the fuck do I talk with you"" part. With YA group of girls I never have problem with being included and listened to.

"People who try to get dirt on anyone and everyone so they can use it as a weapon later if they need to. They may just seem like a “gossip” but it’s a lot more sinister than that.   Also people in relationships who are obsessed with their partners physical appearance or only demand that their partner stay super hot or they’ll leave them. Yes, it’s important to keep attraction but at a certain point it’s about their insecurities. I knew someone who’s wife just had a baby and he kept telling her she was fat, even though her build was slim and she only had a little of the baby weight. He is the most insecure person I know."

"Oh no. I went to a school like this and it honestly fucked me up for life.  The toxic behaviours from that type of schooling that you gradually learn while your brain is still developing... It's affected every part of my adult life.   I've had years of therapy for depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety etc, and never thought that the overly competitive culture of my school was linked to it (big plot twist ikr). Turns out A LOT of the awful thoughts I have and even little habits, etc, like the way I go about life every day all stem from that terrible ""if you don't go to Oxford or Cambridge, you're better off dead"" mentality that was engrained in us by all the teachers when I was at school."
"Absolutely  Even for people who make good eye contact, breaks are common.  When you hold that steady gaze it gets taken in different ways.

"2 years is not severely speech delayed, my god. Why do people put this pressure on themselves?! I've seen kids who started speaking at 3, no autism, no nothing! - and grew up normal teenagers. But no, no one can contain their comments when it comes to kids, and they will not tell you about those cases, they will tell you about neighbor's daughter who spoke full sentences at 1.5. God, I don't even have kids and that makes me mad.  Not meeting a single milestone at a young age means nothing, if you made sure no special physical or psychological help is needed. If you child is clearly not autistic and not deaf, please remember this has zero correlation with their development further. In a few years, no one will know or care when they said their first word."

It's weird scrolling through the comments and seeing how insecure people present themselves 2 different ways. Some lie about things to make themselves seem better and others don't say a word about themselves because they're afraid they might make themselves look worse. I fall into the latter group. I think the takeaway here is that most of us are at least a little insecure about something. Most of us have that in common.

So yeah, I did a lot of diapers and cleaning up vomit and racing around making sure she didn't actually kill herself and watching the same movie 5000 times or cleaning up playdo but I don't think I really felt *that* responsible for her and I still got to sleep."

"In my experience, people who plan to go into academia enter PhD programs straight out of undergrad. If you plan on getting a real world job with a PhD, it's disadvantageous to do it without obtaining work experience first. Most workplaces don't want to pay doctorate-level pay to someone with undergrad-level real world experience."
"It's not the people tired of the 10th ""we had an emergency, pray for us"" post from the same person this week that causes the problem. It's the people who are actually attention seekers and not suffering from a serious mental disorder that cause the problem by making false emergency claims all the time. Or, people with an actual problem who haven't gotten help. It's impossible not to be tired of it. I can't stay emotionally invested in those posts every time they are made if the person chronically posts them. Maybe they do have a real problem but, I'm not their therapist or their emotional punching bag.   To want to reply with something like, ""omg, are you okay?"" Requires me to care. And if they never respond or brush me off, now I feel like me caring was a waste because clearly they don't care about me enough in return to let me know they are or aren't okay. They don't want to start a dialogue, they want attention. Whether they want attention because they are insecure, narcissistic, have an actual mental problem, or a combination of those things, is not my fault nor does it require me to keep caring about all of their posts.   Let's be clear here, there's a difference between someone occasionally posting something that you should probably care about like, ""I just feel like no one wants me around."" Then there is Karen's string of posts this week like,   ""OMG just got into a car wreck, pray for us!""   (Usually she's told one friend the truth and they might eventually comment that she bumped a curb and got a dent in the bumper.) (Karen rarely replies to people asking if she's alright, or she is curt or rude in her response.)  ""Thinking about going to the ER again, ugh!"" (She won't be responding to people asking about her.) (If the one friend knows the truth comes in, they might say, ""I wouldn't go to the ER for a cough."")  ""Todd got hurt at work today! Ugh what a bad day."" (No. She's not going to mention that Todd just banged his elbow on something and has a bruise. No, she's not going to tell you why the day is so bad.)  Maybe Karen has a mental problem that she should take seriously. I am not a doctor. I am not a psychiatrist. I am a person who can't stay emotionally invested in Karen's emergencies."

"You mentioned paying off the national debt. That would be pretty useless.  I agree that there are potentially many things that are socially desirable but not necessarily privately profitable, hence they don't get enough investment. For example, maybe we have insufficient investment in renewable energy. But you have to consider that if you tax this wealth and put it toward renewables, you are not taking money out of an underground vault. You are taking it from other productive activities--many of which are extremely important and useful.  I mean, speaking of government debt, a lot of this wealth is invested in government debt. So when the government is funding all of the things you like, they are literally using the money you are talking about. If we were to confiscate all this wealth, all we would save is the very low interest rate the government currently pays on those loans. That's the benefit of confiscating it, but the cost of confiscating it is discouraging people from investing and saving and doing all of the many productive things that generate that kind of wealth in the first place."

In retrospect, that did show my insecurities as a kid cause I was being bullied in elementary school and obsessed about being cool to escape that.  Good thing I had great friends in junior high that still are my best friends till this day. But sometimes I wonder if they ever questioned my stories as they never mentionned them."

"Constantly posting about *only* the good points in their life on social media. To the point where their life just seems too good to be true (which it probably is).  I find that the most confident people either A) aren't active on social media, or B) if they are active, they are open and quite unreactive about their mistakes and follies, and just their general life.  A flip side to this would be insecure people constantly posting about negative happenings in their life, constantly putting themselves down for the smallest things. Perhaps to gain sympathy or compliments? I don't know.  Another thing is that insecure people often post those sickeningly positive posts that almost make it seem like they have a superiority complex. Like the ones that put down others more than anything. This is really prominent with my athlete peers, especially the ones that are always on the bench during games lol."

"You're absolutely not alone in this. I came into a department surrounded by tons of people leagues smarter than me, not fully invested in the topic I'm researching, and dealing with some emotional/mental health issues (still am). The imposter syndrome was at an all time high.   My quals exam was horrific. After a year of study, we had to prepare for weeks (some people studied for months) to master material from 3 different grad level subjects, take a huge written exam, and then withstand a panel of professors just asking you whatever material/problems they want with you walking them through material at a board. I passed, but afterwards I felt like the stupidest fuck on the planet. I couldn't believe that the professors had passed me given my performance on the written part of the exam. Eventually after days of questioning, I came to terms with the fact that the professors had considered the entire exam and wouldn't have passed me if they felt like I didn't demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the material. When I came to terms with that, it took a load of self-hate off of me. I still feel like the experience was terrible, but I reduced the amount of anger and bitterness I was targeting at myself.  I understand those 3 pm days. Sometimes I don't get out of bed until 4 or 5 even. That experience boosted my depression, and the few absurdly stressful and (at times) self destructive semesters I've had kind of just withered me away. I'm still questioning whether or not I truly want to stick out this phd. I got lucky in that I got deeper into my topic and it started to become interesting to me. But the bottom line is I also wanted to shift towards building an environment and foundation for myself where I could regain confidence.  I started up therapy and it's helping me realize things about myself that are important for change and personal growth. I started up a creative project outside of school - something long term that I can chip away at for months if not years, in a medium/skill where I'm both comfortable and still learning, and don't have to exhaust myself in the same way I do in academics. I recommend to pick something to do outside of school that you're interested in, skilled at, or excited about to just pursue as a way to ground yourself. It can be really therapeutic and can give you enjoyment and small bursts of confidence.   Anyways, keep your head up. The experiences of grad school can be painful, but you learn a lot about yourself in the process."

One word descriptions. All very staged (I’ve been with them when they’ve made posts that resemble nothing to what’s actually going on).   I don’t use any social media anymore (been off fb for like 7 years and recently took down ig)   So now that I’m back to living without social media- I realize how easy it is to get sucked in when everyone is looking at you. Your not living the moment authentically your living for the post, likes, tagging , bragging rights.. etc   A lot of my anxiety has gone away now because of it.  I will catch one of these gals posting something and tagging the other gal. The other gal will take a screen shot of that and then tag her back and repost.

And I ended up cutting off most of the people I associated myself with and found new amazing friends and have been nearly completely honest with and it’s been so much better and less stressful.  Honesty ended up helping me accept myself more and become less insecure overtime. So glad I did what I did, even though I lost some friends."

"My wife is very insecure about our youngest child's milestones but that is because he is autistic. I don't think that's a sign of her overall being an insecure person. On the other hand, when we bring our son out to playgrounds and the such, we definitely get that feeling and those looks of judgement like we have failed as parents. It's really sad to know that so many mothers are like that. If something happened to a little kid in front of me, I would put everything on hold to make sure that the little kid was okay. Some of these moms seem like they would leave a little kid to die on its own if it wasn't theirs. So sad that this attitude has become so popular. It was unheard of when I was little. It felt like you could go up to almost any mom to ask for help back then."

"Making a reddit post, essentially begging people to give you tips for not being insecure about being insecure."
Truck-nuts
"Our current president, daily."
"they aren’t open to having conversations about things they aren’t familiar with. They always need to share something about themselves and when they can’t, they either don’t listen and/or try and change the subject. And often times, they don’t even listen to your stories if they DO know about it. They just share their experiences instead"
People who claim to be brutally honest often care more about being brutal than being honest.
Ah! A typical Redditor I see.
"Oh I see, I believe that they were probably upset that you didn’t say it in a nicer way. I don’t think you said it harsh at all but very direct bout bad news without softening the blow.   I guess it’s like a doctor telling a patient’s family “She has cancer. She’s going to die.” He is being very direct about news and it isn’t softened enough for the family to take it in better.   I’m sorry that your aunt is getting deported though."

A person screaming im insecure
AskReddit posts about sex.
"My teacher used me as an example and said I was 5’11, I’m like 6’1-6’2 and I corrected her and she was like so I’m an inch off, and then I felt like I was being insecure about my height since I corrected her over like only 2 inches"

I had this experience. When I started night crew at a grocery store the crew was cracking jokes about weird sexual experices and I recounted one where a buddy in scout camp put hot sauce on his asshole. But I made it into a story that I did. And almost 10 years later I still can't live it down.
"I have an essential oils Buddha shop, you should visit so getting reincarnated is 7.15x10^4 % faster than everyone else!"

"Don't apologize for your opinions.  Everyone is entitled to them... and anyone who is genuinely offended is probably the person who is in denial for posting sappy shit.  My last sappy post? I got married, and before that?  Engaged, 5 years earlier.     You want to post ""my husband randomly bought me flowers, how awesome?!"" go for it, that was a nice gesture and I hope he treats you like that all the time.  ""I woke up to the greatest person ever lying right next to me"" type comments Every. Single. Day. Nahhh gtfo, that's getting into 'tire-slashing crazy ex' territory."
The two things I care about most in my life are my girlfriend and my dog. In that order. Sorry about your pup :( there is always another out there who needs your love. maybe whenever you are ready. you sound like a nice person.
"This *sounds* like it’s true, but it isn’t. I can give the most expert opinion on myself, but you would have of course to read between the lines and judge for yourself. In some conversations it might be useful to know that i have a X personality trait, but if I don’t tell you, how would you know?"
Caring about the opinions of random anonymous people on the internet.
"Creating BS about race (like african-americans or people who live in the middle east) or religion (such as Islam or Judaism) to feel superior, then saying you're ""redpilled"" for hating members of that race/religion. Doubly so if they act violently towards members of said race/religion."

Because insecure=toxic?
Honestly just bragging and one upping general. It shows that your personality really has nothing to offer other than the things you've done.
Getting extremely jealous whenever your SO speaks to another person. Like if you see your boyfriend talking to another girl etc.
"When people disguise their brags as something they are ashamed of, either to not sound like they are bragging or to fish for compliments. I remember seeing a tweet from a girl that said she was looking for big 🍆 when someone replies with ""I'm only 7 inches :("". I see this everywhere."
Making fun of other people in public
When you as the boss or senior teammate  feel the need to one up your fellow colleagues who may or may not have just gotten out of college.
"I dislike password managers because if someone gets access to it, they instantly have a list with all services, username and password you use."
"I can't take a picture. I just can't find one where I would even look like a human being. When my boyfriend is also in the picture, though, I like it a lot more since he always makes them better."
Not letting/wanting your ex to move on...
Telnet.
"Dragging others down or making jokes at someone's  expense in a group. Banter between friends is fun, but if you introduce your friend with some snide remark it says a lot more about you."
Not even just conversations. I used to not be able to go places that I was allowed to go because I thought people would question it. Like. Going into my next class just because I wasnt sure if it was the right one.
"They also don't know the difference between 'telling it like it is' and 'telling it like I see it'.  One is the statement of an unequivocal fact, the other is an unsubstantiated opinion, but of course lots of people believe the latter is equivalent to the former."
Social media.
Banning an artist because they liked a tweet.
"Where I live, it is paying too much of their pay to live in the swank area of town.  I've met many people over the years, some live in the city center because they can afford it, some live there because they truly want to take advantage of it and don't care about saving money or living paycheck to paycheck to do it, some just want to be able to say they did it, and only stay a few years, but some people are so desperate to be seen as in or as richer than they are that they're embarrassed to not live in a posh area.  They sacrifice basics like saving for retirement \* or having anything beyond a basic emergency fund \* and spend all of their money on rent and clothes and the expensive gyms, in other words, on image.  It's kind of sad/scary when you see someone in their late 30s and 40s living like this.  \*for younger redditors, yes, these are basic expenses, for the demographic I'm talking about, living where we live"
Needing to fill all of the silences with the sound of your own voice.
"Hearing a disagreement and immediately acting like you're a victim, a heroic underdog who has to defeat the big bad villain who dares to have a different opinion. Complete with, ""well you KNOw,"" ""well maybe yUo,"" ""and that's just the way it is!"" And turning on a heel to leave the room with the air of a mic drop because they think they're such a cool winner. We all know someone like that."

"It just feels awkward and weird to look at someone in the eyes for an extended period of time without breaking while talking.  It feels like I'm just staring at them.  My problem is moreso that I think everyone else finds me annoying.  I've been told this is t the case at all, but I always think I'm unwanted in situations except when I'm with my close friends."

I don’t think I’ve ever seen any non-toxic people post this kind of stuff.
My reflection when I look in the mirrof
"Just a way of getting attention, even negative attention was still attention, so I would exaggerate how good or bad something was to either garner sympathy or praise. When you're normal life was being ignored you learn to do anything just to get some sort of attention."
"Redirected a person to another line while working at a gas station since I had to go to the back to do other stuff. He yelled at me about how I didn't want to wait on him since ""He's fat and looks funny."" his words not mine"

Whatever people brag about is what they're lacking in most.
Wow this is so relatable.  Lately I've been trying to be more social in group situations but most of the time when I say something it barely gets acknowledged. I don't even think people know they're doing it. I've come to accept that it's just the way I am and I'm not even going to try anymore. People just don't relate to me.  I make a point of giving the other person in a conversation the sense that he/she is being heard and that I'm committing my full attention to them. Hardly ever does this get reciprocated. I'm just an afterthought.  So I too have only a small amount of people I bother with and I'm ok with that.

"I figure this is a good as place as any to ask something thats been bugging me. Does it scream that I'm insecure if I try to get people to appreciate something I've worked hard on. Some examples include a) taking a drawing with me to a restaurant to ""work"" on it b) asking friends to come give me ""advice"" on a build i finished in minecraft, and probably a bunch of other examples as well. It really feels like I'm fishing for compliments, but at the same time, i want my works to be seen, and generally they wont unless i try to show them off."

My rules of thumb are pretty much “is there any benefit to saying this?” and “Is this my business?”.
Bullying just flat-out bullying. They're just pushing someone else down so that they can feel higher up. It not only makes the person they're bullying and secure but also shows then and other people that they are weak.

Late to the party but.....  Declaring people who disagree with you on an issue (political or otherwise) are immoral and bad because of it.    We can be wrong without being immoral.  And you are wrong more than you think (otherwise you wouldn’t be wrong by definition).
Virtue signaling
"I've found its usually when people are constantly talking shit about other people, usually they're very gossipy and are the first ones to run in the room going ""You guys, you'll never believe what I just heard!"" without giving any thought to what the information coming out of their mouth might do to someone else or whether it is true or not. I knew a lot of people like this in college and it felt good taking them down a peg or two when they decided to run their mouths."
"""What other people think of you is none of your fucking business"" I am insecure and see a lot of people in here that are as well.  This phrase has helped me a lot."
"I'm secure in who I am. Some people cheat, so if they do, i just move on"
When people boast about how homophobic they are.
"When you hear any laughter, and immediately think that they are laughing about you"
It definitely can be and I’m sorry that was the case for you. People on reddit are just quick to assume it’s the norm when it’s usually the exception.
Constant Instagram stories
Interesting. I know people like this and can't tell if they know they're doing it.
When a person hates everyone you introduce them to that you know personally it screams insecurity. They’re just worried you might like that person better than them so they hate on anyone from the get.
Calling everyone you disagree with a Russian agent/asset/bot.
Constantly looking in the mirror to make sure you look presentable
And it’s always “n” between the two. Like John n Sandy Sanderson

They really go for it then: NO! He probably watches it 8 times s day! A PA in the making! Drop him now! Etc...  And behold if anyone, says it's not a Problem...  FFS watching porn is not cheating, to look at porn  3 times a week is fucking normal, when you're young, just let your man wank, it has absolutely nothing to do with you!  At the same time, they are devaluing all the people who actually have a real problem with it..."

What’s the most insignificant and inconsequential thing you had found yourself lying about.
Celebrating and posting on social media for every month anniversary of your relationship.  Putting down others. Especially people who are already down.   Announcing every minor medical issue you have in a bid for attention.   Needing to one up others.  Refusing to make or answer phone calls.
"To me there's two types of insecure:  1. People that act obnoxiously and talk up about themselves. 2. People that act intrusivly and talk down about themselves.  I'd say I display number 2 more, and I think that that makes me somehow better or more bearable than group 1. But truth is we both have issues that need addressing and are as bad as each other."
Karma farming on Reddit
"I always assume one cheated unless they are 50+. It is especially weird when the two are very different in what they post, but do so regularly. The parents of my daughter's friend have a joint one and since it doesn't say ""AND"" I assumed for a   long time it was the mom only using her maiden name (think ""Jane Connor Smith,"" I assumed Connor was mom's maiden name, not that Connor Smith was dad). One day, sweet photos of the kids' dance recital. Next day, a barrage of misspelled ""Lock her up"" type of memes and anti-Muslim propaganda. I felt better once I figured out it was a joint one since my daughter only really ever interacts with the mom."
"From personal experiance,  randomly dropping out in the middle of conversations,  both online and irl,  because you feel like no one cares about anything you're saying."

Ended up skipping 6th grade, went to one of the top unis in the country, graduated with honors. I still have a slight lisp and sometimes I give up on pronouncing certain words, but otherwise I'm a perfectly intelligent and functional adult.   I'm cheering for your kid! It seems like you're giving your kid the attention they need and the rest will follow from there. :)"

"When I turned 17, I finally stopped wetting the bed. Mommy groups are 100% a scam.  Edit: to add to this, your kids will only be geniuses if you casually teach them to be. It's easier if you actually are a genius, but yeah don't just read the '4 year old only' books to them. Get the 13&amp;up toys for them if they want them (and only if they don't eat the toys anymore).   Have a bookshelf in every room filled with books, if you can. Put the more mature books higher up, but don't forbid the reading of any books. Make sure to screw it to the wall in several places.... Because a lot of kids like to climb. Bolt a ladder on the side as well, just in case.  Always explain things extra. Like when skipping rocks, you should put a decent be 1:1 ratio of power to spin so that you can get the stone to skip as far as possible when you aim a little bit above the horizon.  Always ask if they looked it up first, and then go look it up. Look through the source material with them. Being an Inquisitor of Knowledge is an adventure 😁"
"Fresh out of my PhD program, I got hired by a big insurance company. For the first two months or so, my boss peppered our conversations with unironic references to how smart he was. It seemed really strange and awkward to me at the time.

It's even funnier now because I was so excited to have a real job that I wouldn't have questioned him anyway."

When someone gushes about their relationship saying how in love they are with the other person. I feel like that’s a sign they’re insecure in their relationship. Not exactly the answer to your question.

lol omg hope that won't be me. okay I'm definitely not getting married anytime soon but I've always wanted to have a banging ass crazy wedding and get married at a volcano. Especially since I'm gay the lack of wedding dress expense can be put towards the reception / vacay
I’m the same. I usually don’t keep up conversations out of fear that the other person won’t find me interesting. Need to find ways to change that since now I have no friends.

"Hey, I get where you're coming from. I used to think in very similar ways.  But I'll tell you now, from direct experience, that you are significantly overestimating how much people are actually judging you.  If you cut yourself from people consistently, all that happens is they stop paying attention to you. And not in a way that's rude, or dismissive, but simply because you gave them nothing to work with. They leave you to do your own thing because they assume that's what you want. Most people don't have the time or mental energy to break through the barriers that are clearly set up around you.  This is going to sound harsh, but if you honestly believe that 99% of people you meet won't like you, then you're always going to present yourself as conceited. There's nothing 1% about your personality, you aren't some special outcast.  Give a little of yourself to people. Throw out some small talk. Do the social dance. Why? Because even though it might seem insignificant, other people will do the same, and from there meaningful bonds will grow. You have to start with the chitty chatty BS in order to find people who you actually vibe with.  This reply is already too long, but my main point is start showing people that you are actually interested in engaging with them. From there, making connections is easy."

"I happened to me because I am a very shy person. When I was about to lose my virginity with crush (dream came true) I was in her house and we were alone, she lived with her mother and grandma, both outside the city, and it was early december. We decided to go to her home to set the synthetic fibre christmas tree andnother things, it was going to be at night and she said I could sleep at her house. Got there with some vodka and we started drinking and begun playing truth or dare, at like 2am things got hot and we started to dare to get off our clothes, thats when all started, I did not wanted to embarrass her so I stopped when she was at her underwear, first mistake. Also I accidentally three my glass and vodka got spilled, cus I was so nervous. At like 2:30am She decided that I was not going to take the step so she directly told me ""I dont know if you are going to do it cus you look so insecure, but I want to"" and got her top off, God those boobs were amazing, perfect hand fit, but as you can imagine, things kept getting worse in my behavior. First of all, got a boner that didnt decay in the rest of the night, and it embarrased me so I tried to not step out of the sofa (Yes, she was almost naked but I still felt that way with something so dumb), The next dare she told me was to get one another piece of cothing off, I need to mention that I was in boxers and socks, Yes, I took my socks off. Continued with some kiss dares and grabbing some things. Finally I decided to make my move, she dares me to lift her in my back and do a walk around the kitchen, I take her to her room and.... I couldnt undress her so I decised to tell her that I needed to use the bathroom. Oh God I was that boy. Pissed and my boner got down, I got even more nervous but got back there, the lights were off and she told me ""I know is your first time but I though you were more confident, antwsy, I should take care of you from now, put off your boxers, I will teach you something amazing"". You would think that at the end it was fine cus I got what I wanted, well... I didnt cum, she didnt came, We stopped cus she was sleepy, and told me ""I think I need to be alone and think about this"" and I got home after one of the worst nights of my life.

Trying to point out what you perceive to be shortcomings in others then not having an open mind to entertain the rationale from the other side. For some reason it’s become normal for people to view differences in opinion and lifestyle as faults that should be targeted and called out. There’s a difference between a discussion of different views and stonewall with someone behind it that can’t argue their point calmly and rationally. IMO this screams insecurity.

Like a teacher bullying me for not understanding some basics (like fables) and put me and a friend in front of class and put to the laughingstock...    So yeah there is a trauma somewhere too.

She is super critical of my friend and my friend has always felt like a disappointment to her mother. They got into an argument last night, and she told her mother, ""Well I'll always be a disappointment to you, it doesn't matter what I do,"" and her mom was genuinely shocked and upset that my friend felt that way. She said, ""You could NEVER be a disappointment to me,"" and apologized repeatedly. But she's also never stopped and thought about the fact that her constant criticism would make my friend FEEL that way.   She's literally done no self-reflection in her entire life, I don't think."

“I’m not insecure.”
Short guys in big trucks
constantly asking people if they’re listening and not letting them do ANYTHING when you’re talking to them. it’s annoying as fuck and shows that you need to be the center of attention and have major insecurities
When someone tells you something they did or feel proud of and you immediately try to “keep them grounded” by shitting on their feelings or accomplishments. That’s peak insecurity imho.

"I’ve given you actual observations I’ve made.  Do I still see drivers that drive poorly otherwise?  Of course.  Do I see as many poor drivers in lifted trucks as I do poor drivers in all other vehicles combined?  Also yes.     Explain how your rebuttal of “I’ve never seen them do it, so it didn’t happen” for the no-passing zone violations is valid please.  I have personally observed it several times from those drivers, so it is not something which never occurs.  Also, altering your exhaust so the noise is not consistent with the overall noise profile of the vehicle is actually illegal; police just often can’t enforce it because they’re rarely around while those people are gunning it."

Both cool friendly guys but you need to know what you’re getting into in order to tolerate them. I threw a little get together once and invited both of them, with the intention of squaring them off against each other to see who would break first. Immovable object, meet unstoppable force. It was really a sight to behold. This was a few years ago and I think they are still talking at each other to this day."

"People who are constantly criticizing little details of ones appearance or personality. Like, the littlest things that literally don’t bother anyone.   Normally those are also things that aren’t in ones’ control like someone’s hair or even things that make them unique like sense of style and such.   I think there’s a difference between having an opinion and being insecure and hateful. When they constantly notice those small details and tackle them to make unpleasant comments, that screams insecurity louder than anything else for me."
Trying to make jokes that other people make without them being funny/ without you being able to deliver the joke as well. Also constantly cursing.

And when I ask her what's up it's either ""don't worry it's been sorted"" or something trivial like ""I have a feeling my friend is drifting away from me"" when it turns out he just has more friends he liked to hang out with besides just her. Be less vague, just tell me what's up and stop begging for attention and validation."

"This is why I was in a mommy group for just a couple of months before I bailed. On top of the constantly seeking validation from other parents and touting about their prodigy kid, there was also that whole creepy group-think going on. Dare deviate from that month's hot parenting book and you were looked at like you were the devil.  The harsh judging is so off-putting and such an odd mix between severe parenting anxiety, a superiority complex, and the intense need to fit into a group of peers. Mommy-politics is *exhausting*."

"I have a friend like this. I thought ""Jay"" was an absolute bullshit artist for years. Then he introduced me to a group of his old war buddies when we all went to his island in Nova Scotia.   He'd been downplaying *everything*.   - He really was a double agent during a certain war and he'd gone in drag on multiple occasions, passing successfully each time. *Jay doesn't look like a woman, no way, no how.*  - Jay has been involved in high-speed, high-stakes races all over the world. *I know he doesn't care about money and lives frugally, never gave a thought to his owning an island since many do, but he's apparently filthy rich.*  - He was a war hero and saved a lot of lives. He scared the enemy with his war cry. *That's too corny, yelling tells them where to shoot! His buddies swore it was true though, said the enemy was superstitious, freaked and couldn't aim. They could get close enough to take them out without losing (m)any.*  There's lots more but I'll leave it here lest I dox my friend."

"The two statements you pointed out don’t contradict each other. You don’t have to answer for my experiences, the concept of which you brought up not me, and what I have experienced is a fact, whether you choose to trust that or not is up to you, this is the internet. And you don’t have the answers to whether my assessments of these situations is correct. That one is pretty straightforward, as I’m not claiming my personal experiences voiced through reddit posts are facts. I believe I am justified, but I do not have to explain myself to you. You don’t care that i think you’re a tit, I don’t care that you feel I am unreasonable. Yes, I will believe what the world around me tells me to be true and what I experience until I have evidence to believe otherwise, that is how humans work. That is why studies exist, hell that’s why reddit exists. Information. You have shown repeatedly that you will avoid every part of these comments which will make you wrong in any way, even though we’re arguing about things I didn’t even claim in my original post and even though I AGREED with your initial response. Now, I’d bet, you will pick some segment of this, take it out of context, argue something irrelevant along the lines of truth and falseness that has nothing to do with my argument, and fail to understand that just because we both have something to bring to the conversation doesn’t mean either of us have to be wrong.

I have this shit stain of a boss who keep on commenting on people size. It’s obvious he’s got some self esteem issues. He tried to pull that shit on me too asking if I gained weight in that douche condescending tone. So Cuse I’m a 17 year old kid who’s just bigger than him (he’s tall but I’m taller) asked him if he wears a helmet or if his skulls naturally thick like me. Of course not surprising anyone went over his head and that was that. Remember kids if you boss if being a shit stain at work show them how much they don’t matter to you if you want them to duck off.

Of course there’s nothing wrong in being proud of your partner, but more often than not I’ve seen these couples break up the most.

Like bitch, people are only asking because they are worried about you. If you arent going to tell then then why post it?? If you dont want people in your business why are you making it public??  I have a half sister like this. She'll post concerning stuff about how her life is terrible and shes been hiding in her room alone drinking wine all day. And it's like first off, what's going on? Second, who's watching your kids?? and third, you dont want people to ask questions why post this kind of stuff?? We are worried! Then she'll get mad about how it's nobodies business what she does and blah blah blah. Or sometimes she'll post vague details about some violent altercation she had with her baby daddy on and off boyfriend then get pissy when people start asking questions or suggestioning he isnt right for her and that she should put her boys first and leave. Then next day it's all cuddles and sunshine and posts about how much she *looooves* him, and perfect and sweet he is to her.  Before anyone asks, yes, shes in an abusive relationship, or maybe it's just a violent relationship? What would the term be when *both* parties are violent and abusive? They are are both equally toxic, controlling, and violent. She is in no way any less a victim or an abuser than he is, It's just a complete shitshow. We've all tried to help her seperate from him but she doesnt want too and got mad at our interference. She is totally happy having someone she can beat on, even if they hit her back."
I’ve seen this it’s super stupid. My best friend has a daughter and we hang out all the time. She’s 4. I take her to the park sometimes so mom and dad can have a break and oh my God it’s crazy.

I remember she was running around the playground and one of the parents were like oh is she with you? I was like yup that’s my little princess. She replied with your princesses shorts are too short I wouldn’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. I was so baffled I couldn’t even respond. I was like uhh her mom dressed her specifically for the park she’s fine? I almost bitch slapped a mom who I can almost guarantee drives a mini van and is on the pta. I’m a 6’3 260lb male.

"It's funny, I'm the complete opposite. When I was younger I was fit, confidant, had friends etc and hated looking people in the eye.  Now that I'm older and way more insecure than I used to be I've trained myself to look people directly in the eye to hide my insecurity. I still feel it, the anxiety is crippling sometimes but I do it because I don't want people to see how shitty I really feel inside.  Hard relate on the thinking everyone is better than you though. I've had a really shitty year with separating from my wife and I'm just now wanting to get back into the dating scene. I've actually somehow got a decent number of matches on tinder over the last couple of weeks and I haven't messaged a single one because in my own head what the fuck do I have to offer to someone else.

"This one girl on my snapchat posts about how fine she is, says stuff like ""I'm so beautiful"". I find that egotistical and weird, and people like her would have no reason to post how great they must look unless they are somehow worried about how they look. That's just the way I see it, maybe she just has an ego."

It really frustrates me because it means I can never get their true opinion on anything so I feel like I can't ever ask them for help with stuff. Especially cos I've had issues with a girl they're also friends with and they don't want to pick a side. From a totally unbiased standpoint, they're on my side, but they won't say so because they don't want to upset anyone.  It's really annoying because they won't take a side on literally anything.

"My one coworker was super insecure and, truthfully, bad at their job. I don't know how to explain it or how to coach them, they were just not very good at most of what we do.  Through some odd ways, they got a job elsewhere, and their announcement hit the quarterly digest we get. It was this really peculiar, glowing, almost an epitaph of them.  Later, I joked that it was weird they let the typos go to print. They admitted they wrote it, and it went in as written.  They would do a lot of things to promote talents they had like say how smart everyone in their lives were, etc. It really made me realizing at once they were really wishing they could be the person they wrote about."
"Let’s say someone says “I went to Europe last year.”  And you respond with “oh yeah, my family goes there every year” really just trying to be part of the conversation.  I always worry that makes me look like a one-upper when really all I’m doing is peaking my honest experience.  It has gotten to the point where I just smile and nod, and don’t even mention things I’ve seen or done because most often than not, I have seen or done or traveled everywhere.  My family is wealthy.  When I hang out with wealthy friends of mine, it is normal conversation.  When I’m with people I work with or other friends, it is like I annoy them."

"Thank you for this. Yes I do believe I have imposter syndrome and I can sometimes recognize when my mind is being irrational. I tried talking to my PI about it a couple weeks ago and I mentioned my qualifier killing my last morsel of confidence and he said ""What? You did well on your qualifier"" and that genuinely stunned me, I had an entirely different perception than he apparently did. But my mind keeps telling me no he's lying, he's just saying that to make you feel better. Or no, he doesn't actually know how much you were bullshitting in front of the committee, I'm sure the committee spoke behind my back about how dreadful it was, etc. I can't shake off those thoughts. And it's a vicious cycle, I can't get myself to put in the work anymore and I'm unprepared for meetings, rinse and repeat. I was supposed to submit a paper by now but I haven't even started it. The best word to describe the feeling is ""paralyzing""  I can't keep on like this, I need to find some support network like you said.

"As an insecure person myself, I often find I’m always super fearful of being seen as subservient to others. For example, if I do/say something that others find annoying, and I notice that others find it annoying, I’ll stop. However, if someone tells me to stop right when I reach that conclusion, I’ll keep doing it just because I don’t want people to think that it’s just because they told me to. It’s a bad habit and one that I’m working on, but that can be a telltale sign of insecurity."

And then proceed to panic as I realize I've missed their name, their entire introduction, and have been staring at them in horror for the last five seconds as this dawns on me."

"One of the most awful people I've known is guilty of this. She's always going on about all of her talent and accomplishments and directly calling herself ""an innocent girl"" lol. She pretty much constantly trash talks others  (when she isn't bragging about something she did that involved them) and then sprinkles in some unsolicited reminders about how she has ""no reason to lie!""  I'm pretty certain than most of her behavior is fueled by some ulterior motives (money and attention), but it always kind of comes off like she's also trying hard to convince herself that she's really just that great and that nothing that has ever happened has ever been her fault. She's the kind of person where even though you *know* they're lying/exaggerating/misrepresenting a situation, you're also pretty sure that at this point they probably kind of believe their own lie. It's a really strange and bad situation exacerbated by the fact that she's also surrounded by lots of gullible, sycophantic people who act like gasoline on a fire."
"Just because you hide the truth and be a hypocrite to seem nice doesn't mean whoever doesn't do the same and straight up tell the truth is ""mean and rude"".

"Constantly complaining about other people. I’m gonna butcher the saying, but “If you met an asshole today, you met an asshole. If everyone you met today was an asshole, then you’re the asshole.” From experience (hi, I’ve had a shitload of therapy) this is definitely a sign of insecurity. The way we perceive others and talk about them (on average) is a direct reflection of the way we feel about ourselves, and the things we’re most critical of in ourselves. Keep rolling your eyes at people and being critical of how everyone is and you’ll eventually end up alone. You’ll blame others but the truth is, it’s a reality you built for yourself because it’s what you felt like you deserved, and to protect yourself from others’ scrutiny and judgement."

"I used to be really insecure about the fact that of my immediate family, I’m the one who has the fewest and lowest degrees.   My father was an attorney (JD), my mother had two MAs and a business degree. My older sister has a Bachelor’s in Bio, went on to be Veterinary Instructor, and currently has her own practice. My younger sister has an MBA and a teaching Master’s. Both of their husbands came from the same neuro-psych-pharmacology PhD program. One had a JD, the other had a Master’s in Biology but now runs a Mayo Clinic. My older sister’s second long term partner had a PhD in cancer research.   I only have an AS in Zoology, and a dual Bachelor’s in BIO and Anthro, with aHistory minor (1 credit short, but that’s because I kept taking non required history classes- so who cares?)  Basically, my whole degree, is designed to get me work as a career animal caretaker, know about how those species evolved and where they came from, as well as the cultures in that area; and so wanted to be able to identify my patrons and where they came from to near be able to talk to them in a way that they will learn the most.   I actually still use my degree. I’m still employed in my academic field, well past 25 years. I know barely a handful of people who get paid for doing what they studied, and I know I’m exceedingly lucky to be able to do what I like. Some of my family members are doing what their degrees are in, but most of them didn’t (since passed away) or don’t like their fields (and either hate it every day or went into something else entirely).   I watched my dad hate his career and come alive for the weekends when he could perform in the local repertory theatres. I think that was one of the biggest lessons I took from him: sure, having money would be nice, but I’d rather make a living doing what I like.   Once I realized that, I stopped giving a shit about competing with anyone. Forging my own path instead of “go to school, get married, have kids” has been a hell of a lot more fulfilling. And as a former zookeeper / current doggy daycare park handler, I’ve done a lot of things nobody else will ever do."

"I feel that oversized things scream it out. I was very insecure to the point where I started to hate my body. My mom would want me to try and look decent but I had such low self esteem I couldn't even do that. I would put on sweat pants and a oversized sweater, or oversized shirt because I hated the way my body looked in anything else. I think what lead to thinking that way was the people around me tbh. My mom would always comment on how much I ate and when I was younger, most girls would bully me because of how ""developed"" at the age of 10. I couldn't help it. The boys they liked, liked me. I didn't like them back because I hated attention like that. I wanted someone to see me more than just my body. I eventually grew put of it and lost a few pounds to a good weight for me and I feel so much more confident that I wear normal sized shirts and occasionally I would wear leggings. If you feel someone is insecure, don't comment on what they wear because your judgment only makes it worse."
How about you put all that hate you have for immigrants and poor people and aim it at the ones that hire them and create more poor people.  What do you think will happen if people refuse to work for a salary that doesn't even feed your family or pay the rent? They hire the ones that are willing to live off noodles and share a living space with 20 other people because the alternative is death in their own country. Either by the cartel or by actually starving to death. The only way for those in charge to keep us from pointing fingers at them is to give us someone else to point our fingers at.

"You lovely person, you. Thanks! About the kid... She's a sweet soul, but boy does she confound the shit out of me. Things from birth-10 years are mostly a joy... exhausting and sometimes infuriating, but mostly a joy. The tween stuff is a bit of a nightmare! If only she acted like a cat, we would get on like a house on fire, hahaha. I find the dogs infinitely easier, and if I'm honest, at this particular life stage, more rewarding. 😂 fingers crossed she makes it to adulthood without despising me forever/needing all the therapy. I always like hearing from people without kids that they don't mind or even like the kid posts. You're a good egg."

"Unless your kid has a real disability that would prevent them from reaching milestones, this shit all evens out in the end. Kids go at their own pace and by the time they are older, nobody even cares or remembers if you crawled early or potty trained late. For example,  I see other parents always bragging about potty training their kid once they hit two, but their kid still shits themselves and pisses in their bed every night. We waited till our kid was 3 and good and ready, it took two days and never had an accident again."

Im an introvert but i often feel comfortable when talking in a small group of people cuz idk at home or school I don't get to tell about things that I like or im passionate about so if for example, I meet a new group of people and I seem comfortable I will probably talk non-stop not exactly about me personally but just talk a lot about random stuff that I know"

"I mean I'm pretty strong and I frequently joke about only being able to bench/squat/deadlift the bar. I do this because I like talking about lifting but don't want to talk about numbers when people ask me. It's funny, to me and some others, because of juxtaposition. I'm not a particularly big guy but it's very, very clear that I lift and I'm secure enough to know that. But hey, it'd be so much funnier and I could tell so many more people who I'm not trying to impress how heavy of pieces of metal I can lift if I just got more secure and stopped making fun of myself. This applies to many things in life. You don't need to take yourself super seriously to be confident and secure in your identity."
"I get this too. I constantly feel like people are just too nice to tell me to piss off, and when I do something that I can tell annoys them it sticks with me, so I start to distance myself from groups of people because even if I'm not an annoyance I feel like I'm ""just there"" and they're indifferent to my presence."

"Some obvious embellishments aside, that is almost word for word a story that has been circulating for *years* on the web."
"People having to buy themselves nice things to get people to notice them, this ones pretty obvious, but people who have “drip” or “bling” for no other reason than to catch eyes, is the most artificial form of satisfaction, and then they preach “stay humble” as they pull up in a six-figure car. In my eyes, I see them having to real self-respect or security with themselves, so they get a false sense of it from having more than others, and showing it off.   I’m not saying it’s bad to have nice things, I’m just saying the reason for getting the nice things is what matters."
"Xactly, so if you see just as many drivers of different vehicles driving like assholes, why are you saying it's a lifted truck problem? You've seen many lifted trucks passing in school zones? Not buying it but even if for some reason you live in a wild area where ppl do that regularly, theres no reason it would be predominantly truck drivers.   Custom exhaust is not illegal unless it passes a certain decibel level determined by your province/state/county and to reach those levels in a normal vehicle, you need to have almost no exhaust at all. There are also cars that come stock from the factory that exceed those levels and are illegal without any modifications."

I was still pretty sensitive so I didn't say anything and just kept my back turned.      Over the weekend shit kicked off, manageress quit the next day and I was dismissed by the boss the day after. Reported her ass as soon as I could."
"I have this problem where I talk about myself too much because I feel like I need to prove I do things. Like I was talking to my ex’s brother about Just Cause 3 and I had to go into so much detail to prove that I have played the game, even though he probably never doubted me. I had to keep saying new things to further validate my claims, but then I’d think that since I had said so many things he might think that I just looked it up and am trying to show off and have never played it. I don’t know why I’m like this."

A lot of our co workers will approach me and tell me how stupid it is that he never shuts up about himself and to me that screams insecurity. I’m not cocky but I think he knows that I have more friends at our job than he does and I’m friendly with everyone and people seem to like me better."
Saying edgy stuff in public
"I’m sure that sort of attitude is some sort of mental illness in itself. Or maybe I’m just trying to attribute being so insanely selfish to something or anything because I have a hard time grasping that sort of self centeredness even in children and teens. It’s just surreal to me how it has sort of become a game to these types of people. “Well, I have half read a Wikipedia page or two and I diagnosed myself with this, this and that and those are all super rare so that makes me damn near boss level”. It’s not a competition and I don’t see how it has become one.  And I have such a hard time figuring out why someone would get any sort of joy out of feeling or pretending to be oppressed or hurting or whatever.  I used to use Tumblr a lot in my early twenties and whoever was the “worst off” got the most attention, had swarms of people rushing to their defense anytime they were called out for shitty behavior or would even go as far as to “send me money I’m sad and need a new tablet for my OC Art!” And would get it. So I suppose maybe it boils down to a way to scam the world around them. Much like people who claim to have cancer to get large donations for treatment or housing and we just see this more as we have a bigger window to more people than we used to.  Did she finally get help? Or was it more of a “we’ll do the bare minimum and claim we tried” sort of deal? Because I’ve seen that happen far too many times, especially as someone who grew up in a very abusive home. It’s legitimately heart breaking that these types of people get free passes and pats on the head but people suffering tend to get overlooked and I think that’s why I hate this so fucking much."

She doesn't usually because it's boring but if she asked me about it I'd talk about it anyway, so why worry about her reading it?  Pretty much the only thing we stay out of 100% are each others business computers/phones, but that's more of a business ethics and legal thing than personal space thing.  Maybe we're weird.

"As a fellow insecure person, I tell all of the worst stories about myself. All of the times where I made comically bad decisions, hurt people, failed, and lost. Eye contact is easier for me when I know I'm being genuine. A whole lot of people don't like me, and that's rational on their part because I kinda suck, but at least they get to make that judgement instead of me doing it for them. It at least gives you a fighting chance, and an honorable one."
I usto have a friend  who would do this but the opposite so  if you told a sad thing that happened to you he would one up your sad story. we eventually just started to say Hi my name is ______ and I have a way sadder story then you.
A few questions for ya:  What’s the difference between confidence and arrogance?   What would a confident person do if complimented?   What would an arrogant person do if complimented?  Do you think the average person can distinguish a confident person from an arrogant person?

"I have a coworker like this. I have about eight years of experience on her. I am way more objectively successful, etc and she views me as a threat instead of seeing it as an opportunity to learn.  I would be happy to teach her things if she didnt actively bully me and try to harm my reputation by spreading rumors and being a huge cunt."
I would tell you but my Mom said it's a bad idea to put your full name on the internet

"That could definitely be it, as well. It would make a lot of sense as a lot of kids and teens do outlandish things for attention as it’s so vital to their development and when they’re not getting it where they should, they reach out elsewhere.  I don’t think it’s always the case for everyone, but for some people I would say it’s spot on."
Narcissistic Personality Disorder?

Is he an anti vaxxer now?
"When people acknowledge what you say but don’t respond like you may expect so you repeat the same sentence again for clarification that they heard you and have input on what you’ve said. Contextually speaking when you’re preempting a response from others and then others don’t respond to it you get all self-conscious that you’re being ignored, and that to me is a sign to myself and others of insecurity."
I'm glad this helped you!
"Being insecure is inherent in feeling like you are a burden/this kind of suffering, though. It’s cyclic."
I think you're  confusing insecure people with. Narcissists. Insecure people are usually afraid to be in the spot light.

"Any hints of toxic masculinity, such as calling others beta, cuck (OK, to be fair, this is an appropriate insult for some people, but it is rarely used correctly, from what I have seen), or showboating. It's a good thing that you are buff, rich, smart, attractive, or whatever, but be humble and not brag about your quality to others who are not on the same level. A little bit arrogance is probably okay, but don't be an unbearable douchebag about anything."

"Literally just witnessed someone going through this, and thought this exact thing in the back of my mind the whole time. Lol.  My guy friend randomly pops up in a relationship.. Very random and fast. They were constantly posting lovey dovey things about each other online publicly (which seemed weird in itself) even posting apology letters... Wtf? Lol, but 2 months later the relationship is over and now he's posting ""horrible ex"" quotes. I always say there is a motive behind people constantly showing off their relationship.. Whether it's to piss someone off, make someone jealous, or prove to the world they can have a great relationship. Either way, I'd be weary if my SO blasted us on social media constantly."

“Speak softly and...”
My brain.
"Thing is, some people are playing a rigged game. It's hard to be objective about yourself, especially if you have low-self esteem, depression, anxiety, or a number of other issues. I hate my voice and I hate the things I say. I'm constantly hard on myself. Not trying to make this about me, but just giving my own experience as an example. Having someone you trust to talk to can be really helpful, because they can give you a difference perspective on yourself."
"Going off on someone in a big group of people.  Trying to demean, be mean and puff themselves up to somehow come off as better.  I  hate these asses, but feels good to smile and not respond to their idiocy.."
"A slightly more subtle one is a person who takes things personally very easily.  They tend to not handle criticism well, disagreements or general disinterest.  They also end up being people who you end up reassuring that you are just having a bad day, it’s not them, constantly.  I start to notice that I feel pressured to watch my words (can’t tell them I didn’t like their favorite tv show!) or show that I’m super stressed.  They freak out on me a but if I’m unintentionally short with them in a high stress environment and generally just unable to step back and think “Is this person’s reaction based on ME or the situation?”  They will always assume that your reaction is based on a fault of theirs, which is unintentionally self-centered, and completely unrealistic.    I get it, I used to be like this, and struggle with it still.  That voice that says “they must hate me if they said that!” or “wow they must think I’m awful for this idea” is not real.  Step back and counter it, “yes, this person seems annoyed but it could easily be something else.” Or “They said they didn’t like this idea, not me as a person.”   Being able to step back and not take it personal is MORE KIND to the person you are dealing with than assuming it is you and trying to modulate your behavior.  By putting that pressure on someone you are forcing them to be responsible for your emotions!"
As a insecure person I talk really loudly because people always talk over me
Isolating your SO from friends and family so you can control them.   Telling your SO they are nothing without you.   Physically threatening your SO.   Physically harming your SO.   Emotionally abusing your SO.

"I don’t have regular/frequent conversations with people much these days. I prefer to spend a lot of my time alone. However, when I do talk to people, I have a tendency to go on tangents and ramble about stuff. Though I always try to shut up and listen when the other person has something to say.  I find myself doing a loud, exaggerated “aaaaaanyway”, but only when I’ve suddenly realized I’ve been talking a lot for a while. I try to use that as a way of saying “I could keep rambling on, but if you have anything you wanna talk about, here’s a chance to cut in and change topics.”   However, people obviously can’t read my thoughts (hopefully....) so I hope I don’t come across as the kinda guy you described."
Being toxic in general. Maybe the person’s just bitchy tho.

"For me that screams ""I don't hear very well and as long as I'm talking I don't have to keep asking you to repeat yourself or bluff that I heard you and make up an answer while hoping for the best after you keep talking at the same low volume despite me telling you multiple times in no uncertain terms how bad my hearing is""."
"Yeah,  people that like wearing jewelry are so fucking insecure"
"I would disagree about saying needing a diaper when sleeping means a kid isn’t potty trained. It’s an entirely different ball park and some kids struggle with that into their preteen years or more and to say they aren’t potty trained would be disrespectful. Kids gain bladder control at night at different ages; in fact there are genes correlated with delayed bladder control in sleep. Now saying a child is potty trained when they have several accidents a day is quite different, but if a kid is just struggling with bed wetting then it is reasonable to celebrate their child being potty trained because that’s an accomplishment and bedwetting is a whole different ballpark."

Bullying and putting others down to make yourself feel better
"That really is a very weak form of it. The ones were (meaning at least me) talking about here revolve more around joking about being a loser, or depressed, never leaving the bed, you know, actually deprecating stuff instead of ""hey you know that good thing I do, well I do it a bit worse than most"". It's funny, don't get me wrong, but not at all what was actually meant here I would have to assume.  And yes, before anyone here asks, I am gatekeeping comedy, and making fun of yourselves, because I indeed hate everything in life that has anything to do with ""fun""."

"People who speak very quietly when meeting some one new. I only say this because I'm super insecure, particularly about my voice, so when I meet some one most of the time I bow my head and mumble 'nice to meet you' so quietly they don't even hear it. I can speak at a regular volume but only around my boyfriend and two friends. When I'm uncomfortable or insecure(which is almost constantly) I just clam up and find myself physically incapable of speaking louder. Maybe it's because the biggest complaint people had about me when I was a kid was that I was too loud and talked too much, so now I just don't talk around most people. Whenever I do speak it's always very well received and people tend to view me as a quiet but very smart person. My boyfriend would tell a different story of how I'm a complete dumbass(on the cute way)  who knows a lot of about certain subjects. Basically I try to make up for quietness by being packed full of fun facts and knowledge. I could go on about what I do because of my insecurity but they mostly seem to already be listed, so being a mouse it is."
"I have a friend who posts on IG almost weekly about kicking the shit out of women who “mess with her man” or shit like...”a queen protects her king”. It makes me want to barf!!! Like...seriously, what the fuck!?!   Girl,  your husband is ugly AF you are not in danger!"
Thank you. Your experience sounds horrific too. It does feel better to shift some of that blame outward instead of internalizing everything. I'm convinced these qualifiers are designed to strip us of our dignity to the point where only the soundest of mind survive without going through a crisis.  I will try doing what you recommended. I need a hobby that gives me enjoyment instead of having my whole livelihood depend on my research

For most intents and purposes he's a great dad. I've seen him with his kids. He shares time with them 50/50 between him and their mom. He definitely should not prioritize work over them but it's not like he's a deadbeat dad.
Mature response. You must’ve missed the part where I verbatim said:  &gt;	it is still insecurity  The human experience is nuanced.
Doesnt cut hair as they are worried they will be judged/ have a not in fashion cut.
This hits too close to home.
Constantly bringing others down with comments. Especially if these comments are made behind their back.
"If you married a great person and work with smart people, I think a majority of the population would consider that a happy life.   Based on your comment, I think you’re giving your coworkers far too much credit for how often they think about you. I say that in the best possible sense. I have people close to me who struggle with the same kind of doubt and confidence issues and they think that other people are constantly inspecting them or judging them."
"To add to this, I would say a charismatic person would be more likely to ask questions and make conversation about whatever the topic is, even if they have no real personal interest."
"I used this tactic once in a girl who always had something “random” to brag about, and was always trying to dominate conversation. She told me she was a clown at church, so I told her my cousin was in clown school, things like that."

"They often get defensive even when you don't mean to be offensive.  I had a friend at uni who was like this. There was this once when we were discussing plans to meet up for lunch between lectures, and she was like ""hmm, I might skip my midday lecture and come meet you at 12."" And I, considering how her grades had been dropping lately, half-heartedly said ""well, it might be better for you to go to the lecture... Don't you want that credit?"" All of a sudden she started snapping at me: ""Why do I HAVE to go?? Are you saying I can't get a credit just because I miss this ONE single lecture?? What's wrong with missing one? I'm not being a bad student, the teacher is the one who's bad at teaching!"" Then she continued going on for quite awhile. I tried to explain to her that I wasn't being serious but she kept on going.  It's so tiring to be friends with someone like this. You do feel sorry for them, but you just don't feel like it's worthwhile to hang out with them."

It’s insecurity but it’s a safe insecurity considering the situation. The only time I think it’s ok. Or like the other person said if you’re over 65 lol.

"We do, and it's not excusable. My husband has dyslexia and is an educational psychologist. I've only realised since him telling me about how it effected him emotionally, that its widely socially accepted to mock dyslexics for being 'stupid' and not being able to read. Dyslexia effects many different everyday activities and brain functionality and isnt solely difficulty with reading. Its also a difficulty with reading and not with comprehending what is written. People wouldn't so often so openly mock someone with a physical disability, or another neurodivergence like autism.    I can understand why this guys friend may be a generally angry individual."
Agreed.  Same principle.

"1. When you bring down others to lift yourself up.  I could never talk too much about the good stuff that happened in my life, like a good grade or something, because my one friend would use that as breeding grounds to tell me how much their life sucked because they didn’t have that specific good thing happen to them too. In math class, if I got a better grade than them on a test, they would say it’s because the teacher hates them and doesn’t want them to do good, even when it’s because they never paid attention in class and had mentally given up on themselves.  2. When you are super clingy This particular friend was very clingy(physically and emotionally), and extremely dramatic about their life."

"Honestly the root of it is a mix of self-loathing and self-obsession, imo. You’re obsessed with how other people perceive you *and* you feel like you don’t measure up.  1. Realize you have innate potential to do great things  2. Realize everyone messes up and comes up short. As cliche as it is, every single success comes from failing and learning. Want to be the best at MMA? You’re gonna get your ass beat thousands of times before you learn. Want to be an amazing programmer? You’re going to fail interviews and develop shitty code over and over and over until you start to spot design patterns and such.  3. No one thinks about you nearly as much as you do. Called someone the wrong name? They forgot by the end of the day. Forgot to zip your trousers? No one remembers."

I hope you can take  time to explore and find a good hobby for yourself, it's never good to base your livelihood on academics or your research. There is so much more to you than that."

"I've been told time after time that I need to be more confident but I just really don't want to come across as arrogant since social confidence doesn't necessarily come naturally to me.  I just don't want to cross the line between confidence and arrogance.  But to answer your questions I would say a confident person would thank someone for the compliment and maybe return one but a arrogant person would continue to boast about themselves and maybe compare themselves to the other person.  And, yeah, I think most people can distinguish the two but I'm worried about them distinguishing me as arrogant.  Although, to be honest I've never once had the complaint that I'm arrogant so this worry of mine is completely unfounded and just a result of my insecurity."

Jumping from one relationship to another. Also staying in a toxic situation due to lack of self confidence.
"That’s exactly what it is. Younger kids learn a lot of basic stuff from their older siblings, or even in daycares. I learned to walk a few days after my babysitters son did, because we spent every day together and I watched him. My sister hit all her milestones even earlier than I did because she was watching me."
"I'm a communicator. I like to be really open with people about the positive things to help create context for the negative things. Telling your friends ""I honestly love you and I want to stay friends forever but you are annoying me right now"" is actually good in my experience. The ""right now"" assures them that this is a long-term relationship and that you're not trying to get rid of them or feigning affection, but that you want to continue developing the relationship in positive ways."

Every once in a while I’ll take a selfie and say “this one looks okay” and then I’ll come back and see it and think “wtf was I thinking this is disgusting” then proceed to immediately delete it. the thing is I’m only this harsh on myself because I think everyone else is so beautiful in their own way. I just hate every little thing about myself and my awkward personality haha...

She’s stole her sisters identity and racked up tons of debt, uses her parents and everyone who attempts to help her, and even made a fake gofundme to take a trip to Orlando. She’s an awful person and every time I meet someone who is overly fake and seemingly altruistic, I wonder what they’re hiding."

Our conversations quickly became me just asking how his weekend was and allowing him to excitedly share his experiences with me. I just stopped sharing after a while because I figured he didn’t really care. When I came to this realization, I sorta just faded away from him. I don’t usually fight for friendships to work. That’s an issue that I don’t really feel like I need to work on lol. But from the bottom of my heart, I just want for everyone to be content with their life and experiences."

"As a former insecure person, there is a way to feel confident. First step, realize that you cant control the people around you, but you can control the people around you. Meaning you cant control the actions of others but you can choose the people you spend time with.   Also, the people that judge you, exclude you, and dont believe you are probably not people you want to include in your life. Be selective about the people you surround yourself with.  Once you let go of what you think others think, life really feels better.   P.s. we are much more interesting than we ever think we are. Just be you and see where that gets you. :D"

"Fishing for compliments by putting yourself down.   I have an instructor in a class at my gym who is painfully insecure. She commonly forgets her routines and when she messes up, instead of just quietly moving on, she will draw attention to it. The other day she has a tiny screw-up and yells- “oh I’m such a failure, aren’t I?” And everyone in the class is like “ no you are amazing!” Etc etc. She always points out how “ugly” she is tooo (which is absurd- she is stunning). For example she’ll say something like “ugh eww just look at me, clearly I woke up on the wrong side of the bed” and like clockwork everyone responds “no way, you are so gorgeous!” She says this stuff in front of 40-50 people. It’s pretty sad, actually."

"That makes me sad.   I know you're not asking for advice, may I give some?  I am on the autistic spectrum so I have similar experience and still don't know what social cues to look for the understand how deep the water is in those situations. But here's what helped me.  Using one of your examples, you said people will think you're lying by maybe telling a story or something that happened to you. You know you're not lying, but think about why are you sharing that story. If it's to self validate yourself or so you can feel included or get others to like you then I can't tell you how to make that work out.  Instead, if the story you're sharing, using that same example, is to help someone who's going through something hard to have some hope, or to help someone feel validated, or just to give someone something to laugh about, then just forget about wanting to feel accepted, or whither or not they see bad in you. People have historically seen bad in the best, perfect people. Make sure your intentions are good. Focus on making sure others know YOU care rather than if they care about you.  I hope that helps, because for me it's hard to tell how others feel about me, but I can control how I feel about others and hope that a pure honest effort will (not show them that I am really a loving person, again that's not the point, but rather) help other people that I care about be happy.  TLDR to feel less insecure, be selfless and serve others"

I know it’s hard but reminding yourself that people aren’t naturally cruel may help. Best of luck!"

"I'm no therapist but many acid trips have been spent thinking about this very thing. I have been a manager for several years and figuring out how to positively influence others' decisions in non-invasive ways has always been something I want to understand as well as I can. Additionally, I have OCD, self-doubt is a huge struggle for us, basically even if I logically know I'm doing the right thing there will still be a voice in my head screaming that I'm fucking it up; or telling me to imagine what would happen if I fucked it up in some implausible way. And you know what happens? I end up doing it because I'm imagining doing it.  Many things work this way for humans, in my opinion, and insecurity is one. ""Vibes"" that you might give off are just a combination of your words, tone, body language, and whatever the person observing you happens to be thinking or feeling for reasons unrelated to you (that last one is why it's important to NEVER jump to any conclusions, whether you're talking or listening; worst-case scenario assumptions are another big OCD struggle).  There is also a certain mysterious element that we don't quite understand yet when it comes to empathy. MRI scans show that human brains automatically mirror each other at a physical, electrical level when experiencing empathy. So what you're feeling might very well be being broadcast to those around you, or vice-versa.  Basically what I'm saying is that it's hard to pin down specific things that will ALWAYS give off an insecure vibe, and that worrying about being perceived as insecure might cause you to do just that; if you have bad feelings about your own thoughts, others might feel the feelings without understanding what you're upset about. But in general the understanding that things may be misunderstood by you or others, and the conscious decision to genuinely ignore what you THINK others think about you (as long as you are minding your own business and being a positive example) is the most effective way to exude confidence."
This right here...i've seen this so many times it's scary. Happens when they think people are just better than them too. Have to being them down to what the feel is their level or lower.

"I'm very insecure. So here I am, a gym rat. At 270 pounds fairly lean. As I grow larger and stronger I get more insecure. I thought growing larger would help especially being as tall as I am. But it doesn't. I think the only thing that really helps is just loving yourself for who you are. As stupid as it sounds it's just refreshing. You're overweight? So what, that's you. You got acne?

"I know you didn't ask for advice, but here are my thoughts on what I think you are trying to get at:  1) People don't normally tell people nice things to piss them off. (unless its a joke and if you don't burst out laughing then they are terrible comedians). That is actually very abnormal.  2) More than likely, there is at least 1 person in your groups who is genuinely glad you show up.  3) People who will pour out their feelings of you are rare, so you really won't ever know what a person thinks of you. So stop worrying about it and fake it until you make it!"

If someone takes a minute to genuinely compliment you, the least you can do is accept the compliment. Throwing it back in their face by immediately putting yourself down isn’t healthy and will only isolate you."

"asking what screams ""I'm insecure"""
"Sometimes it can be a mix of the two. My father could be described as charismatic, and interesting to talk to. At the same time, he's developed the tendency to, well, talk about himself to some degree. Usually it's in the realm of 'we're talking about x and this is my personal experience/opinion about x', and since he's rather worldly and well-traveled he has lots to say. The problem is, he tends to dominate the conversation as a result, and interrupts people when he has something to say.  Combine that with a tendency to not care what *other* people are talking about (either because it's outside his experience or he's already decided it's not worth talking about), and you get someone who's both interesting/charismatic to talk to but also dominating and irritating.  It contrasts starkly with my mannerisms, especially in groups. I sit quietly and listen to what's being said, and only occasionally say something if there's a pause and I have something to say."
"Sometimes I have a similar story or actually the same, but I always hold myself back from telling since it will look like I'm one upping the others story? Although, if I really did told that similar story, does it really constitute as being insecure? Or its just that you are sharing similar experiences?   Just wondering since the commenter here seem to state that one upping someone's story is seen as insecure but have not seen any rebuttals to that point."

"Coming from a very insecure person:  Putting oneself down or telling others that you don’t expect much in return, even though the littlest thing would mean the *world* to you  Not maintaining eye contact  Wringing hands or having other anxious tics that they  fall into during conversations  Excessive sweating  *Telling someone you’re sweating* to try to laugh about it but it just makes it awkward  Stuttering/swallowing or having their voice crack during a conversation  Either taking over the conversation and oversharing or not speaking loudly at all and having others talk over you/repeat what you say and get more attention  For some people, being *extremely nice*... I’ve made blankets and custom stickers for friends for their birthdays, mainly so I can see them be happy and I want them to know how much I care about them, but also because I want something in return in the future. Not something that grand of a gesture, and it’s never the forefront of why I give them a gift, but even a card on my birthday or a small present would mean so so much. I don’t have to have a big party or a huge gift basket, but something more than just a “happy birthday!” Text would be really nice. And in that subject.

"Also some signs that if the person is changing into this, it's time to check on them. When I developed an eating disorder this is sort of what happened to me, along with becoming incredibly depressed because my best friend no longer wanted to be around me. I specifically remember desperately wanting to hang out with her but her family disliked me and made me uncomfortable, so I google searched things like ""how to get used to being alone"" and ""how to live with no friends""   In retrospect I want to cry and hug my old self because I was only 15. I had before been a vibrant, super quirky and confident (borderline annoying) girl who had tons of friends. The fact that when I began to get depressed, everyone punished me for it and abandoned me, made it so much worse. I know depressed people can be tough to deal with, but now I know the pain and I always check in with people to make sure they are not lonely or isolating themselves."

"This is specific but honestly something like gatekeeping.  A lot of the “my art is *real* art and yours isn’t” stuff screams, “that person is insecure.”  Comic books aren’t literature, comic book movies aren’t cinema.  Pop music isn’t real music.  You know the type..."

"&gt;threw up his hands and yelled ""That's it, I fucking quit!"" and turned around and walked off. He said he never saw him again.  After having hung out with several EMTs and heard some crazy stories (including transporting a meth patient to the emergency room, fighting him all the way, only to have him pull out his own eyeballs during the transfer to the hospital), the most unrealistic thing here is quitting, leaving his partner in the lurch without even assessing the patient, who is probably bleeding to death. No way he would have left his partner alone to deal with that."

"Nobody is born secure or insecure. And the only way we “are” something is if we were born as “it”.  What I mean is this: we believe our thoughts, so if we think we are insecure, we identify ourselves with it and boom: a new identity is born. A false identity that we will carry with is for the rest of our lives.   We are born complete, however lose sight of who and how strong we are.  What if you let go of the thought that is hiding you back.  What if you stopped believing in this story that your mind is playing for you?  What if felt comfortable with feeling uncomfortable?  All our sufferings some from our thinking, without any true  connection to the real world.   Are you open to open something fresh, like you are just an secure or insecure as the person next to you?  If you stop believing your thoughts, they will lose their power over you. I’m speaking from experience."

"Story time A couple of years ago my older sister (a) sadly had a still born birth after a long healthy pregnancy, so naturally there was a funeral. Now my eldest sister (b) has always been very controlling of her husband and insecure around me (idk why, I see him as a big brother, hes very faithful, and I'm not a flirty person especially not with other peoples husbands. Gross.) Anyway a day before the funeral b starts telling everyone that A has charged her with the duty of enforcing a 'palatable and appropriate dress code' and I didnt question it because A is going through a rough time and I'm going to respect that. The dress code that ""a"" insisted upon was long sleeved pants, sensible shoes, and turtle neck all of which needed to be black. The thing is when I showed up I was the only one that had received these instructions, sister A had a plunging neckline, no sleeves, in a short dress. B brushed it off when I tried to ask her about it but she has been trying to pull shenanigans like this everytime she knows theres a family get together. I guess it's not a big deal but Ive lost a lot of respect for her. I've thought of messing with her by dressing super skimpy but I just feel bad that shes so scared that she sees it necessary to orchestrate this nonsense. I just dress appropriately (still not to her liking) and just ignore any comments at this point."

"Acting tough.       I think its adorable when I see someone (normally men, not always) trying to flex or look tough. It screams insecurity and I think it's one of the least intimidating things a person can do.       I was in a job where I interviewed gang members for awhile and the least threatening were always the ones who walked around trying to act the part.       They thought they looked like Biggie, but looked more like a character from Ed Edd n Eddy."

"Speaking from the perspective of a dude, this is one of the biggest red flags I consistently see when talking to a new girl that I'm interested in. If they start ""joking"" about me cheating or being a fuckboy when we've barely even started a relationship, that's my signal to get far away.   It's not cute or funny and it screams ""unresolved trust issues"". It's, quite frankly, very offensive."

I’ve got a friend who when he’s around his Mrs will always crack jokes to downplay or degrade any other males in the conversation or group. She always seems to be on edge when she meets new people as a couple and I think it’s because she’s more worried about how he’ll behave than anything else. It’s pretty new and she’s infatuated with him but it’s like dude chill and get yourself right before the honeymoon period wears off

"Standing in front of the mirror every day examining my self getting dressed and how my clothes fit on my body, changing outfits 2-3 times before I give up. Also I rarely ever leave the house without makeup on. Insecure about my looks so I try to compensate as much I can."
This Nazi shit is getting annoying.
"Yeah,  it can hurt knowing that someone doesn't like you, but many people don't seem to realize that you really can't appease everyone, no matter how hard you try. My dad use to tell me that the first sign of failure is trying to please everyone."
"Kinda like my father as well. Conversations inevitably start being about something he's done, or his opinion about something, and tend to be about subjects *he* wants to talk about.  I've actually tried to strike up conversations about something I find interesting that he doesn't already have an interest in, and he'll either shut it down with some vaguely negative/condescending comment about the subject or he'll change the subject to something he wants to talk about.  I don't think it's *deliberately* rude, per se, he's just *really* used to talking about what he wants to talk about. He's lived a fairly worldly, interesting life so he's got lots of personal experiences he likes talking about and lots of opinions."

Trying to make others feel bad and insecure about things before they can feel nice about it. E.g. making a nasty comment about a new top someone is wearing so they feel embrassed

"Well, I'm insecure in a sense. Like I'm confident but still insecure at the same time.  I was going through this thread and I relate to a lot of this 😅.  I constantly worry about how I come off. I dont like telling stories about myself cause I always feel people are judging me, and think that I'm lying. I dont have a lot of material possessions but the ones that I do, I seend a lot if money on, snd are generally very flashy. I dont even know how to talk about them.w/out sounding like I'm bragging.   I had a Mercedes at 19 and every time I would mention it, people would always think I'm bragging, and would try to knock me down a peg, even though they're the ones that asked me what I drive. I bought it at an auction cause it was a cheap Mercedes and I like the horsepower and it was RWD. I fixed it up and started whipping it around. It was only like 10 years old at the time too, so it still looked good. It still bothers me to this day that I feel I cant enjoy what I like w/out being judged. I dont even like Mercedes, it just had a lot of horsepower and handled pretty well w/ a good sound system.  Thing is though, I'm 6'4, loud, athletic, confident, I can look people in the eyes, joke around, and apparently am very naturally flirty, so people think Im arrogant and cocky, but here I am writing this down because despite all that, I feel inadequate when compared to others. I've been going through some shit cause I honestly dont know what I bring to the table when it comes to relationships and friendships. I feel like other people are way funnier and more fun to be around. When someone I know says something bad about me, like that is generally a respectable criticism I take it to heart cause they're probably right and idk how to fix it. I want to be better. I just dont know how.   Also I think.my life is pretty boring, but people who I tell what's going on says my life is pretty cool, and I domt know how to talk about it w/ out coming off as baggy. I've lived in japan for 3 years, lived in multiple states have had cool adventures but I dont see how to talk about it cause when I mention it, I feel like I co.e off wrong. Idk man, it's hard to explain  I've been reading up a lot on self esteem and I've been really struggling to love myself. Just thought I'd share my perspective."

In high school we had a guy who would constantly talk to smn and follow him around despite him showing clear signs that he doesn't want to be bothered or talk. For example, one time he was talking to a friend of mine (or should I say tried talking to her) and when she said she wanted to go to the bathroom, the dude actually almost followed her in but stopped at the bathroom door.  I kinda feel bad for him because he has almost no social skills but because of that, I have constantly been scared to talk to smn and at the slight sign of annoyance, I back down.

"I had a similar stroke of luck. My first experience with tumblr was through the ""psycho-feminist all men are rapists"" crowd, which kept me away from the whole platform for a long time. I easily could have fallen in there too, and it would have ruined me.  Edit: to those kindly downvoting, I don't think all feminists are like that. But that crowd definitely exists on Tumblr, and that was my first experience with the platform."

Yeah guy, you’ve been doing this 30+ more years than myself, you better figure it out before me.   Recently he told me he’s never felt threatened by another mans intelligence. Sad news, you can learn a lot from people smarter than you but you’ll never learn from ignorance and, “one upping” every one on your “masculinity”.

I find insecure people either post nothing at all on their Snapchat and Instagram stories or constantly post. Often times it’s those Q&amp;A things where people can anonymously send stuff and they ask things about how other people feel about them etc. as well as lots of music. I also see insecure people posting subtle hints in memes and stuff. There’s a lot of other stuff that hints at insecurity but that’s a trend that I see a lot and I haven’t heard it brought up before.

It's just practical if one of us has got our hands busy and there's (for example) a text that needs to be responded to asap. But I would freak if he went through my phone and checked my messages and stuff. Even if I have nothing to hide, I want some things private in life."

"Bragging about the success of people that they are kind of connected to. They have a friend who has a successful startup, their cousin went to Yale, their son made partner, etc.   It is one thing to be proud of the accomplishments of people in your circle.

"Speaking from personal experience: assuming things about people instead of letting them speak for themselves.  For example, assuming that someone doesn't want to talk to you instead of talking to them first and then letting them either continue the conversation or ignore you. But when people think about situations like these I don't think they see it as the first thing I said. Usually when people think about a person who ""assumes things about people"" they think of someone shitty who doesn't give people a chance and yet we're out here doing the same thing."

"I really am one of those people that hates drama and/or confrontation.  I just don't do it.  I will walk away from you if you start yelling or have drama.

When she does she says the ugliest, meanest things to you and about you that she can think of.  There is no reasoning with her when she's mad either.  the more sense you make, the madder she gets and the louder she cusses.  When it's all over she will come later with a ""sorry, I love you"" and think it's all better.  What is the damn point of that?  I'm not putting myself thru that if I don't have to.  Anytime I can, I walk away and let her be mad to herself.  Why be involved in something like that?  There is absolutely no point to it.  You won't solve anything, whatever the issue is.  Even if you make total sense she will not hear it.  She argued with me one day about what the word ""Yet"" meant during an argument.  Insane!  So hell no I don't do drama.  But I never knew it was bad to tell people that until I got on Reddit."

People laugh; I'm still one step away from an arrogant twat but jokes at my own expense are just enough false modesty to make me seem humble. These things aren't funny within the context of this discussion but there are places where they're both appropriate and funny. Besides, the point isn't whether the jokes are funny, the point is that I can say these things and still love myself and know which things I'm joking about are actually strengths, which are actually weaknesses and know that people interested in getting to know me will evaluate my character traits and talents for themselves. My feelings of self-worth and my (questionable) idea of humor are not the same thing. See what I did there?

However on the other spectrum you see people who listen until they hear a catch phrase or word latch on to it and interrupt.

Do that enough times and you'll join my *""needs micromanaging""* list. Those people on my list have always reminded me why they're there and why they deserve to stay there.  As much as I'd like to trust the person doing it, I've learned that some don't care for the company's well being as much as I do, thus, they don't put the effort in.  Some managers grab the bull by the horns and really own the projects they're working on. I really love seeing that."

"constantly comparing yourself to others or finding people to validate yourself, or trying to prove yourself is the best at the demise of others around you"
Everybody is dealing with their own insecurities.  It takes more effort to befriend a person than to make them your enemy.

People who are more concerned with other people's business than their own. The only reason they are so concerned with what you are doing or how you are doing it is because they need to find things wrong with others in order to make themselves feel more successful.
"I've never understood why people in management would treat other staff like rubbish. Team morale would go down, they are more likely to have time off, not likely to put in more of an effort etc.  If you treat them great, they want to turn up to work and they want to work harder and they feel appreciated for it. So when it comes time to ask them to do a little extra, there usually isn't any problems because they are happy you recognize their good work and chose them to do it!"

I understand that your relationship is important, but why do ppl think that they have to shove their heads up their significant others ass?  To me that really screams insecurity."
Another reminder from this post that I am very insecure 😃
"I happened to me because I am a very shy person. When I was about to lose my virginity with crush (dream came true) I was in her house and we were alone, she lived with her mother and grandma, both outside the city, and it was early december. We decided to go to her home to set the synthetic fibre christmas tree andnother things, it was going to be at night and she said I could sleep at her house. Got there with some vodka and we started drinking and begun playing truth or dare, at like 2am things got hot and we started to dare to get off our clothes, thats when all started, I did not wanted to embarrass her so I stopped when she was at her underwear, first mistake. Also I accidentally three my glass and vodka got spilled, cus I was so nervous. At like 2:30am She decided that I was not going to take the step so she directly told me ""I dont know if you are going to do it cus you look so insecure, but I want to"" and got her top off, God those boobs were amazing, perfect hand fit, but as you can imagine, things kept getting worse in my behavior. First of all, got a boner that didnt decay in the rest of the night, and it embarrased me so I tried to not step out of the sofa (Yes, she was almost naked but I still felt that way with something so dumb), The next dare she told me was to get one another piece of cothing off, I need to mention that I was in boxers and socks, Yes, I took my socks off. Continued with some kiss dares and grabbing some things. Finally I decided to make my move, she dares me to lift her in my back and do a walk around the kitchen, I take her to her room and.... I couldnt undress her so I decised to tell her that I needed to use the bathroom. Oh God I was that boy. Pissed and my boner got down, I got even more nervous but got back there, the lights were off and she told me ""I know is your first time but I though you were more confident, antwsy, I should take care of you from now, put off your boxers, I will teach you something amazing"". You would think that at the end it was fine cus I got what I wanted, well... I didnt cum, she didnt came, We stopped cus she was sleepy, and told me ""I think I need to be alone and think about this"" and I got home after one of the worst nights of my life. Message from this story? Dude just take the risk."

I worked with a guy that saw me reading Enders Game at lunch and started taking about what a great story it was.

So that means my dad didn't get his Harley until he was old enough to be a grandpa.  He's an old man with gout.  He told me he's part of a biker gang and I looked it up and it's literally just a bunch of suburban dads who wear relaxed fit jeans, grass-stained white tennis shoes, and monogrammed polo shirts beneath their black vests.  I've begun to look more closely and I realized that nearly all of the Harley enthusiasts are in the ""I can't chase you on foot because I have my knee brace on"" crowd.  Wash down the Wayfarin with a tall glass of Metamucil before heading out and cosplaying in your relaxed fit jeans and leather vest that hasn't fitted around the beer belly for years.  Or if you're younger, cosplaying as a rolling mid-life crisis.  My vagina could not be dryer."

"Joint (bf and gf, husband and wife etc) social media accounts"
"A lot of the top comments are seemingly negative things that people do, but a lot of the most insecure people I know (myself included) generally try hard to seem positive, when inside they are self-depricating. I would have to say laughing at things that are not actually funny, and acting more interested in people than they truly are to make people like them more."
People screaming “I’m very insecure”.
"&gt;Then when someone asks if they’re ok they reply with: ‘don’t ask hun xoxox’  I've heard it called vaguebooking. I've actually unfriended someone for doing this kind of thing constantly. All their posts seem to fish for a reaction, but they'd never provide any context. ""Someone knows what's coming for them!"" ""Argh, this is so depressing."" ""If \*that\* happens at work again, I'm quitting."" - and she'd soak up all the concern without every clarifying what it was about, even if you asked in person :P"
Then when you get a little bit older suddenly it's bragging about how *much* you got to sleep (which is still probably not enough)
"Yeah I do. If I create an environment where people feel shame for their lack of knowledge, they're gonna go and learn said knowledge. If I act like it's fine to be ignorant people are gonna stay ignorant. It's like fat shaming you know. It's not nice, but it works."
"Not sure why you're so mad. Unless....did you shit yourself while driving? I'm sorry bro, that's rough.  Also, read the original post.

It’s good that you’re self aware of these tangents. You’re being very considerate when you take the time to listen to others and you don’t let your insecurity get in the way of it :) I totally get where you’re coming from with all the rambling stuff tho
Not to armchair diagnose anyone but have you considered the possibility that this Richard is on the spectrum?

"Graduating is gonna feel weird. My school was exactly like that-- virtually no one in the school had to worry about whether they had the basic means to survive at home, nor did they have to worry about having the basic means to attend school. So, the school greatly valued their college attendance rate and their AP test averages compared to the terrifyingly low averages of the rest of the country.   It feels sooooooooooo so good to be nowhere near the ""This is how unhealthy I am in order to succeed"" competition. In fact, I feel like I'm now competing to show my uni classmates and my coworkers how fast I'm improving. It feels great!"

"I used a very old windows xp machine that was given to me for basic stuff many years ago, somewhere around 2007 or 2008. Thing is, before I'd gotten it, it had some piece of malware on it that didn't seem to do anything other than preventing programs on the machine from using the internet. This was fine with me because I didn't use it for anything important and the malware did seemingly nothing else, nor did it present itself to the user for ransom or anything.  But this computer had been rarely updated, and still had one application that was able to use the internet: Internet Explorer 6. Which was probably so archaic that the malware didn't have the ability to touch it.  I eventually removed the thing preventing internet use, but just thought it was funny to only use IE6 to get around it. There wasn't anything abnormal about the browser either, so it definitely wasn't intentionally leaving it alone."

Like..go out and do something productive in the world instead of trying to argue with others based on something subjective and living for the next political argument just to try and beat your opinion with someone elses.  It's a never ending battle and you will never win, stop being insecure about it, because you are. Be honest with yourself."
"I totally get the isolation thing, it usually happens in new groups for me since I feel like I don’t have a grasp on the situation. I feel as also they always see me as stupid, dumb, unworthy, etc. And to avoid the scrutiny I just distance myself and don’t talk"
"Np. I find just being genuine is the best start. Be curious about your environment and open to what people have to say.  Around new people, always take the most social option (accepting the offer for coffees, lunch, drinks etc). Get involved in conversations where appropriate.   When someone asks something about you, give them a decent answer if you have one. Avoid punting the question straight back to them. They've taken an interest in you after all.  Pay attention to when you are purposefully distancing yourself from others. Be brave and engage, even just briefly.  Basically show that you are available to others and they'll do the same. Beyond that, find ways to relax and feel confident about yourself."

"I’m someone who is a “tell it like it is person” and I definitely want the blunt and honest truth even if it’s something that I don’t want to hear. Can’t get any better if you don’t know what you’re doing wrong.   What I hate is things like this: I switched jobs in my company a year ago. Went from being an ICU nurse to sitting behind a desk. A month in, I got pulled into the office and was told I was too loud and too offensive. But they wouldn’t tell me what I was being offensive about. They also wouldn’t let me talk to the person who made the complaint so I could ask what I said and apologize for being an insensitive ass. And I had no idea anyone felt like this. In ICU, if people don’t like you or something you did, they just straight up tell you. I didn’t last long in that office job."

"I feel ya. I definitely am a long talker but for me it's just because I hate standing around a bunch of people I barely know and nobody is talking so I just strike up conversation. Then sometimes nobody ever seems to want to take the mic or pick a new topic or just converse at all so I'm left deciding whether to just keep trying to keep the conversation going (in my mind, for all of our sake, not just mine) or go sit somewhere by myself bored as fuck."
"Oh I'm working on this one. I both love and hate being complimented. I'm working on just saying thank you without the need to say anything further. Like if you compliment me on something I'm wearing, that person doesn't need to hear the life story of that particular garment. Or downplaying my input into the thing."

Dude just thank god for this comment and the responses. I've felt the same way. Though I end up trying to justify myself and as I do it I'm aware that zim doing that and then become insecure about that! It's a stupid cycle.   Now I just try and be funny and wait until I need to actually fall asleep before dwelling in the stupid things I've said.

"The person at work who picks one story about something that happened to them, maybe it was funny the first time it was told, but then s/he spends the day going to each person in the office to tell the same story and waits for a reaction. You can tell that they are feeding off that reaction especially in cube-farm type workspaces because the story teller moves more quickly between cubes to re-tell the story simultaneously not realizing that nearly every one heard the first rendition."

Same. I dated a girl and early in the relationship she told me she had a pet tarantula. I was obviously fascinated. One day she told me her tarantula was molting so I asked her to send me a pic cuz I legit wanted to see it.  ... She sent me a screenshot from a youtube video. Something was clearly off so I reverse image searched it and the youtube vid came up.  To this day it baffles me why someone would make something like that up...

"Truth doesn’t have to be blunt and insensitive. There’s a tact that makes it more palatable that you’d probably appreciate being told as well. Telling someone “that shirt doesn’t make you look as good as the other one you have” is better than “you look fat in that shirt” and “I see where your comment was coming from but here’s what you may be overlooking” is better than “that was a stupid thing to say”.  The problem with the latter statements is that people don’t hear you telling the “truth”, they hear you trying to put them down.   In my experience, the people who love telling the “truth” the most are the least enthusiastic about hearing it."

For whatever its worth....I never look people in the eyes. I'm off about 45 degrees off whenever I speak. I've actually found people to be rather receptive to it. Or if they're not..... hasn't made a difference. And im a trial attorney. It's non threatening....they get the idea....but it's not overbearing. If I lock eyes I lose my train of thought. So I just don't.  Edit: I should point out: I'm not the slightest bit insecure. I just like staring off into space when gathering my thoughts to speak.
"not even stuff about me, sometimes i learn a new thing like i learned recently that in Australia they have OPAL FOSSILS and i think thats cool as FUCK. is that part of my insecurity, wanting to talk about cool stuff so people have a reason to talk to me? or is that just how i communicate? or is asking this question part of being insecure? how the hell do people get secure anyway?"

I agree with all of this too. I'd like to add that with avoiding eye contact I feel like people are judging me for not being able to hold eye contact for more than a few seconds. So I'm over here with my eyes darting around and back at their face because I don't know what to look at. I worry too much and hope they don't think I'm weird or a drug addict or something because I feel my insecurities make me so awkward at times.

"Never understood this. Kids growing up, developing and learning stuff is not a competition, with between your own children or with other people’s children.

Most people, including myself, are very bad at staying in touch. Honestly, I would say it's worth asking your college friends if there is a time when they will all be getting together that you could join. A few months ago, I messaged a group chat that I hadn't messaged in probably 3 months and asked them if they wanted to go to a trampoline park(yes we are in our early/mid 20s and went to a children's park) and then get drunk after afterward. Most of them were down and it ended up being worth the 2 hour drive to get down there.  What I'm trying to say is that even though no one has reached out to you, that doesn't mean that they don't want to spend time with you."

Bullying
"Anything considered ""alpha"" or ""hyper-masculine"". Dominating conversations and not letting anyone get a word in edgewise, picking fights over little things like thinking someone dissed you, etc. These are basically defense mechanisms for an incredibly fragile ego. The only reason to dominate others, to not let anyone talk or try to silence them with violence is because you're terrified that, on a level playing field, they will make you look inadequate. And if you're that scared of this, they probably will.  Which is ironic because ""alpha""-ness is supposedly about being confident and rational, but the hallmarks of actually being it come from an extreme lack of confidence and emotionality.  Like with most ideologies, it's as if extreme masculinity and extreme femininity kind of ""horseshoe"" at the center and become identical in nature, differing only in the way they superficially express themselves.  Source: I have a very toxic family member who constantly rants about how tough he is and how he got hardened by growing up in a bad neighborhood, and if you disagree with or correct him on the slightest thing, he throws a temper tantrum and starts screaming about how he literally knows more than anyone else because he's old so they should just shut up and listen to him."

"Yeah I think it's only a problem when people make it a point to pat themselves on the back for only being friends with a certain gender while shitting on their own.    That and when someone is completely incapable of having healthy, genuine, long-term friendships with people of their same gender, it's usually a sign something like insecurity or resentment needs to be addressed. Some people are only friends with people of the opposite gender so as to have no ""competition"".      Plenty of people just end up being friends with others due to shared interests though, and that's more than fine imho. Things are slowly changing, but certain interests do remain more common in guys instead of girls and viceversa after all."
"Just happened to me. I spent 8 years building a successful business with my mum and step dad. He decided to hire his daughter and sister in law, and put them to work in my home office (against my wishes). It was an online business, and both were so incompetent with computers that they struggled to use the online checkout, let alone anything admin. They were jealous of me, so turned against me and turned my stepdad against me. Now I have had to leave the company, the sister in law has sued him, and his daughter said ""he's just my boss aka not dad"" so he's lost all of us (he's a bit of a sociopath). It hurts a lot to put so much into something and leave with nothing."

"The signs arent always bad; they can also be determined through actions. As an insecure person, I constantly avoid social gatherings and places where my close friends arent. For example, I am friends with alot of people, but their friends dont like me (probably my insecurities speaking) so I avoid the party. Also, I want to talk to a girl but there are people around her that I dont know so Ill avoid it.  Edits: Low self esteem is also a big sign of insecurity, lying about things to make yourself seem cooler, etc."

Nailed it. I would consider chidi to be insecure as well

"Well, tbh I know a lot of people that are really insecure, since I’m in middle school, but one of my friends, let’s call her.... stacy, is always saying “ I’m an intellectual” or “ Why do I hang out with troglodytes like you”. When I addressed this problem to her, she got mad like I was being the asshole. But yeah, that’s just what came to mind."
A practice in humility wouldn't hurt. You won't feel insecure if you don't feel the need to 'boast'
"It’s not that I look down on them, I love them and care about them. My very inner inner circle consisted of 11 guys and 2 women. It’s just when I compare the 11 guys to the 2 women, the women are more work. I have lots of other female friends, I just don’t consider them inner circle. They are the types I’d call to grab a drink, go to a concert, go on a girls trip, etc, fun things, but I wouldn’t exactly invite them to my nephew’s birthday party. I’ve been like this my whole life. Even as a small child, I preferred spending time with my uncles over my aunts (I have 11 aunts and 13 uncles), male cousins over female cousins (I have 51 first cousins), and I get along better with my father than my mother.   I think it’s perfectly natural and acceptable to prefer the mentality of one gender over another. I don’t feel compelled to have 11 females in my inner circle just because there are 11 males. I have no desire to seek out more, better female friendships. My life isn’t lacking for having less females in my life."

I have a co worker that stands in the way pretending he doesn't notice you even tho it's very obvious you need to walk past. He doesn't move. He also plays his own music on his Bluetooth speaker in the shop even tho we have a shop radio and it's classic rock on both the radio and his speaker. He also cuts you off mis sentence to chime in and somehow relate it to whatever he has done even if it has nothing to do with what the conversation is about. Tbh his wife takes his paycheck every week and gives him an allowance so if he wants to be a douche at work I let it slide. It's a sad life at home for him.
"Feeling you. This is exactly how my sister is (only sister, 5 years younger than me), who I’ve just travelled halfway around the world to see. She not only dominates every conversation but considers herself vastly more well-informed than anyone else at the table and will aggressively talk over the top of anyone who challenges her. Been with her for 4 days, she’s yet to draw breath from her bombastic opining on everything from American politics and global economics to scathing opinions on Tesla drivers (status-seeking environmental wastrels)  and other assorted ’chardonnay sipping socialists’ (her views, not mine). Apparently the latter mortally offend her own deep social conscience. This from a Porsche-driving, non-recycling, non-working net usurper of resources who owns an absolutely enormous house (no kids) that she has completely refurbished with no regard whatever for recycling; who no longer works (at age 48) but despite continuous protestations about her commitment to social good, the environment etc. has never put any time or money into supporting any cause or charity.  The lack of self awareness is staggering and makes me feel very sad. I‘m leaving in 24 hours and she’s yet to ask me how I’m doing. Kind of wish I hadn’t bothered coming, doubt that I’ll subject myself to this again. I do believe that her behaviour is driven at some level by insecurity, but she’s always been like this and it’s kind of unbearable.  I’m starting to think that being half a world away is about right!"
"People who just generally insult others, even strangers, completely unprovoked. Often they insult or tease people about qualities they don’t like in themselves. Just imagine feeling like you need to put someone else down who has done nothing to you, just to make yourself feel better, that takes a high level of insecurity. Remember this when someone tries to bully you, imagine how much constant pain that person is in emotionally (not excusing them at all by any means)"
I feel that. It’s either I don’t deserve them or they’re lying to make me feel a little better.   It sucks. Man

The people on Facebook that are constantly humble bragging about their life or saying how blessed they are all the time . It feels really unnecessary and when I see them in person (obviously) they are nothing close to how they portray themselves to be.
"Had this one guy who I was introduced to through an ex, had him tell my group 7+ times within the first 30 minutes of meeting, how he's a crew trainer at maccas. Another time, we were at my mates 16th and were sparring in the backyard for shits n gigs. Me, 15 at the time (with minimal fighting experience aside from some classes) and a mate 17 (with just as little experience) went at it and it's safe to say he won. After that, we were complimenting each other and joking around about the spar and the same guy from before jumps into the conversation ""If you came to my gym, you would literally get fucked up."" He always had something to add or something ""impressive"" to say. He didn't even spar when we had the opportunity even tho he was commentating and critiquing us from the sidelines the entire time."
"People in their 30s who post multiple times a day about ""Fuck the haters, other people's opinions of me don't pay my bills. I don't care what anyone thinks about me and I never will.""  Well, honey, considering you've posted a version of that exact status 3 times a day for the past three years, I'm pretty sure you do in fact care what people think."

"A different guy at my work mentioned that the Cure were playing nearby and he wanted to get tickets.  ""The Cure? Their bassist was in my bike magazine a few months ago. He has \*insert ten minutes of information nobody asked about here\* etc.""  Because guy 1 definitely brought the gig up to hear some bike facts.  If you try to talk over him (he talks over everybody) he just gets louder and louder until he's actually shouting. If you wait until he stops and try to rerail the conversation he just does it again. I pick up a book when he starts talking sometimes and he doesn't even notice, as long as one person in the room is playing attention he'll keep going."

"Aw thank you. Can't say it's been all rainbows and unicorns, there was a break up or 3 over the first 5 years. Last two years have been very solid though, I think we both learned from our mistakes and are better off for it. Moved in together a few months ago. I've learned, over time, that making love work requires a lot of empathy and forgiveness, because people, no matter how much you love them, are still fallible and will make mistakes to your detriment. Love really is defined not by the good times, but by how two people cope with and overcome adversity. I think my generation is afraid of the fact that love requires pain to grow, it seems like nowadays young people are very quick to judge and cut off, rather than take time to contemplate and understand."
Never being able to admit that you made a mistake.
"Not looking at anyone straight in the eye or fidgeting with their hands or lanyard, or posting a comment but then immediately deleting it right after because you’re afraid that people are gonna hate on you or accidentally offending someone. (I’m very insecure so these are habits I usually do)"

"I have a coworker like this; every conversation is a chance for her to try to one-up the person she’s conversing with. Recently I found out my dad has prostate cancer; when I told the people in the office, her response? “oh my aunt had that! Stage IV! She died” It was soooo fun to tell her women don’t have prostates and catch that lie. Also, our boss is going through a divorce and she 100% launches at the opportunity to turn his divorce into her divorce and compare how hers was worse. Drives me nuts."
"I've lived and worked a fair amount in Aboriginal communities in Australia. Met many interesting characters. Made some lifelong indigenous friends.  For background, their recent history shares many parallels with Native Americans and the Inuit. Unemployment is high. Alcohol abuse is rampant. Education is negligible - many who ""finish"" high school struggle with basic reading and writing. Domestic violence is far too common. The more remote the community, the fewer the opportunities for its people. Poverty is the norm.  The crab bucket mentality is a real and destructive issue out here. Those who venture out and succeed are often looked down upon as people who think they're better than everyone else. Alternatively, family recognise their success and expect their wealth to be shared amongst everyone; a close Aboriginal friend was telling me his mother disowned him for not giving her money when he visited last (not that she asked for any).  It's a sensitive issue, so much so I wasn't prepared to post this from my regular account. Speaking about indigenous Australians sparks a lot of heated discussion, and frankly I'm tired of hearing Sydneysiders who have never met an indigenous Australian lecture others on what needs to be done. Many Aboriginal people I know are tired of it too.  The whole situation breaks my heart. I hope one day we move past all of this."

"A close friend of mine bought a 2006 VW Passat for $1800 a couple of days ago to use for work. One day later another, not so close, friend bought an completely ordinary looking winter jacket for $1900. And the only reason he bought a jacket for that much money is to say “my jacket is more expensive than your car”.   The most funny thing is the guy with the jacket always brags about him being the most humble person he knows. Like come on, who tf buys an ordinary jacket for $1900 when they earn $1300 per month working full time in a dead beat job?  Imo if you’re always bragging about being humble, guess what? You’re not."

I rarely witness anyone trying to ""one-up"" anyone but if one person talks about their wreck or whatever and someone else mentions a wreck they've been in, then some catty bitch will call them a one-upper (only behind the other person's back, of course) because they can't comprehend that the world isn't out to get them or show them up, all because they're hyper insecure.  I just don't get the obsession. Reddit brings this up all the time. I think it's great when people have interesting stories to tell and want to participate in the discussion instead of just listening to Wendy brag about her convincing knock-off Coach bag for 20 straight minutes."
I...guess? I don’t know what this comment even fuckn means dude
- Penis enlargement = Contrary to what porn shows you having the most oversized dick isn't everything. Even the guy with the biggest dick can lose to someone with the smallest who knows how to please a woman.  - Overly sized breast implants = Anything beyond C or D imo is fucking gross. Certain things in excess are more of a circus sideshow than something you can enjoy.  - Biggest or most valuable &lt;insert valuable object here&gt; = When you have to buy something to start a convorsation and brag about it with others that is as sad as it is pathetic.  - Bullying a single person while in a group = Bullying under any circumstance is bad but those who do it in groups just show they're insecure pussies.  - Having family/relative get you a position in a company rather than working for it. Not really a sign of insecurity but it certainly breeds insecurity.  I can list more but I gotta go...
"I had an hour-and-a-half-long argument regarding this once.  I was linking youtube videos of some of my favorite songs to a group of folks and chatting in PMs with another person at the same time. I was describing why I liked the song, and they asked to hear it. So I linked them. They responded with ""Eh, not my thing. Too whiny. Sorry!""  I proceeded to try and get them to understand that it was rather a rude fucking thing to say, especially since I didn't ask for their opinion. That if the tables had been turned, I would've said ""Well it's not really my kind of music, but it's got &lt;find literally one positive thing about it&gt;."" They refused to acknowledge that what they said was rude, as it was ""their opinion"". They then repeatedly accused me of being upset with them having an ooinion after I, literally 10 times, explained that it had nothing to do with the opinion itself, it was HOW they expressed said opinion. They accused me of being upset FOR the band, continued to refuse any responsibility for being rude, proceeded to be condescending(It's okay if you like it!), and eventually said I was being a pussy.  So yeah. I dunno if that's insecurity, but it's pretty fucking ridiculous."

"As an insecure person, holding your hands close to your chest or tucking your thumbs into fists at your sides automatically makes me comfortable with talking to you, because it means you're just as overwhelmed and insecure as I am."
"I tell myself this every time I think ""What will people think, if.... *insert whatever here*. Literally. No one gives a shit.   And even if they do, which is basically almost never. They think it once then forget about you for the rest of their lives. Thoughts are things that are easily deleted. Your worries of other peoples perceptions are not worth not doing what you enjoy.   As for the eye contact, I had the same issue. The trick is to take it one step at a time. Start short bursts, and just keep cracking at it. Eventually you'll get there.   Anyway. Just passing on some shit that helped me get by.  Keep well, friendo."
"Hmm this is very interesting to me as I am one to make direct eye contact to any and everyone. But I don't see it as a must do. I don't judge people based on if they are making eye contact with me or not. I treat people the same, eye contact or not."
Every single negative trait I read on this hellsite I immediately apply to myself. You underestimate the sheer power of my crippling insecurities

"One of my former friends (we got into lots of fights after years and it got to the point where I could describe that friendship only as toxic) did and is still doing this. I know most of what he is talking about in that regard is in fact bullshit, either because I talked to the talked about women who denied his stories or I was a witness.  Promascutivity wouldn't be anything bad by all means. But he was after a while even bragging about wanting to crash relationships (just for the purpose of sex not because he liked those girls so much), sometimes even of other (still) friends of mine. I really couldn't take that constant oversteping of boundaries anymore at some point, because it really hurted how he talked about those friends of mine and I was in fear that he would always try something with women I like (and succesfully build a connection/relationship with) At some point he kind of made such a threat as a 'joke'.   So I had to let go of him and I am kind of convinced he developed some form of narcism that makes him ""push"" his self-esteem like that."
"I think my sister gets anxious if she feels someone else is missing out on her own daily experience. And she feels the need to reexplain it until you have as clear an image in your as she does.

I vividly remember trying to teach myself how to look people in the eyes when I was like 14 and I didn't know that you can just look at one so I was trying to look at both and my friend laughed at me and made fun of me. Another friend tried to force me to sit there and look her in the eyes for like 10 minutes straight and I ended up crying because it was terrifying and I was anxious. People can be really mean about shit like that and I don't understand why.
"""I'm very insecure"" sreams ""I'm very insecure""."
"I disagree. Physically, men may be stronger than women because they tend to develop more upper body strength. But emotionally? No. They may SEEM emotionally stronger, but that's because they're taught from a young age that ""boys don't cry,"" and to hide their emotions. That doesn't mean they aren't feeling them."
"From the perspective of a friend:  People that make self-deprecating jokes that people struggle to laugh along with. The jokes might be very disheartening, sobering or plain mean-spirited about themselves. Makes you want to turn around and give them a hug.  They might also feel like you're ""cheating"" on them when you hang out with other friends for fear that you secretly hate them, or find other people more interesting.  They don't like to get deep about their insecurities, past regrets, failures and personal shortcomings. Its so embarrassing to them - they don't like to admit just how insecure they are.  On the occasion that they're not validated by the group for their interests - say they like a certain movie and others don't - they will take another persons off hand comment to heart and sear it into their memory."

"I agree with this. Especially the racists see racists part. So many people on social media are so quick to call others racist. People project. As one user said, ""race only really matters to racists."" there was a very smart man who once said, more or less, the only that should matter is content of character.   Everything else, gender, creed, race, is irrelevant. That's how I try to live my life. Unfortunately sometimes this is easier said than done. Shit happens and when someone hurts you it's easy to let emotion take over and irrational feelings of hate towards a group can sometimes form. But it's important to always come back to the truth - which is, in this context, is that the only thing that really matters when interacting with other people, is content of character."
"Can confirm, I used to tell stupid little white lies all the time. Although admittedly I think every teenager does that and I grew out of it in my 20s.  If you still do it into your 30s then it just becomes cringe."

"normal conversation with a person you're not close to, like coworker or neighbor you typically hold eye contact for roughly ten seconds before breaking contact.   Any more than that, and we feel the other person is in our private space. Close friend or family members are comfortable, so more prolonged eye contact is acceptable, those are people you would have no problem if, i.g. your arms were touching sitting next to each on a couch.   If its a stranger, prolonged eye contact becomes similar to have someone literally in your face. Its aggressive"

"You've never heard anyone brag that they're part native, or that they're full white or anything else? Seriously?"
"An easy way to tell the difference is to gauge the level of tact used.  People who truly tell it like it is do so from a positive place, so they do it in the least damaging way that gets an important point across.  By contrast, insecure shits forego any consideration for the thoughts and feelings of others because they are too weak/vulnerable to let themselves care about anyone else.  They do not really care if you take their point.  Their behavior is all about them."

"Just like my son, would not walk at all getting around the age that most kids start, we visit some friends whose kid is the same age, a couple of months younger, who is walking, by the time we left, maybe 30 mins, our son was walking like he had been doing it for months. He just had to see someone the same age as him to encourage him to do it. Not that we were rushing him, as some of our family members pointed out, when we were paranoid about him not walking, the study show that the longer a child crawls, the better it might be for their development especially with hand-eye coordination. Same kind of note, wore nappies til he was four, on his four birthday decided he was to old himself, took of his nappy refused to have another on and no accidents since. His little sister tried the same on her fourth bday, unfortunately she had some accidents, we didn't try to get her back into nappies, as I thought it might hurt her confidence, fortunately she is a confident young lady, at 7, so hopefully this didn't effect her too much."

"And certain body parts that cannot be altered, at least not on your own (e.g. you can train to make your arms more muscular, but you cannot train to change the shape of your ears or nose). One that comes to mind in particular is the penis - so many men are fishing for compliments about theirs in subs like /r/penis or bragging about its size like they had actually done anything to earn it or make it so. They think they're being sexy and seductive, but in reality, they're actually basically holding a neon sign that says *""I'm super insecure and need reassurance in order to feel better about myself!""* It's kind of cringy and sad. Same goes for women who post photos of things like their (natural) breasts and butt on equivalent subs."

As for returning to the same topic over and over, i do have actual memory problems. i can rarely if ever remember who i've told what to. this is Especially apparent with jokes. sometimes i'll learn a new joke and tell the same person like 5 times. i dont do it on purpose, i just have no capacity to get tired of telling the same joke over and over and along with that cant remember who i've told it to. so yeah i do often revisit topics but not on purpose"

"I feel this, also I feel like the very few stories I do tell are massively self deprecating as they are more likely to get a laugh and I don't have to worry about trying to keep people engaged in a story, or I fumble my words and tell it in a rubbish way and usually stop before the end as I'm worried its not interesting enough"
"I can't speak for women wanting to get bigger boobs but for myself, if I could get rid of my ugly face I would. Is that insecurity? Sure. But being attractive would make my life a whole lot better. First and foremost because it would take away my insecurity about how other people see me. If women want to achieve that through a boob job than I'm definitely not judging them for it.  Also, I'd say there's a difference between a woman getting a boob job to try and boost her confidence/self-image and a woman getting a boob job so she can have triple-D's.  Also also, your comment about developing a personality is very condescending. I've been developing my personality through various ways. I travel, read, learn and (try to) do activities that 'scare' me but my face is the first thing people see. Not my personality. Even after developing myself I've never been flirted with. No woman has ever taken any personal interest in me whatsoever.   Physical appearance is a massive part of society. Saying someone should develop a personality instead of trying to built a better self-image is not helpfull at all. It's as if you're saying they're a shitty person for wanting to look attractive."
"OMG  this is so true.  I know 2 neighborhood women.  One would say ""I hope you take this the right way..."" and say something really terrible such as ""no one wants to come to your house because you are a terrible cook  or your husband is boring or everyone hates your toddler.""  Really MEAN things. There was no right way to take whatever she was saying.  The other would start a sentence with ""This might be mean to say..."" and them say something really mean, like ""you have a big nose.""  One time when I heard start a sentence with ""This might be mean to say"" about someone else,  I stopped her by interrupting with ""If it's mean to say, and you know it's mean to say, then do not say it.  No one is asking you for your opinion.  If they are mean, keep them to yourself.""  She looked as if I slapped her across the face.  At any rate, the ""Take this the right way"" woman and the ""This might be mean to say woman"" ended up having a fight only second to the Hatfields and the McCoys.  I just sat back and ate some popcorn."

Are we the same person? Because my story is exactly the same as yours.
Hiding behind a trait or hobby as an identity.
"There’s this girl on Twitter, divadivyne or something shit. I had to unfollow her. She constantly tweets about “I’m single!” Anytime she doesn’t get her way with her bf and deletes it soon after, constantly tweets shit like “my boyfriend loves whores so go follow him”, is isolating him from EVERY female friend seemingly. Like fuck dude. Demands gifts 24/7 but rarely buys him anything. Not to mention she flaunts her PARENTS wealth (they’re wealthy and her moms the same size as her) acting like it’s her own closet full of louboutines, Versace, etc. she straight bullied a girl on twitter posting pictures of her moms closet calling her “broke and obsessed and you wish you had this lifestyle” because they had a slight disagreement.    I’ve noticed a lot of twitter girls are like that. They want the hype from mass amounts of people about how pretty they are but they’re actually very toxic abusive women. I’ve known her and a few others to go on live-streams bashing their boyfriends calling THEM abusive and toxic for no damn reason.   Obviously twitter has some great people and great women.. but man some of them are crazy as fuck"
"Some are, these are called discussions or debates, people have those, arguments, fights, it’s part of being. If you never have those, fucking wrong with you"

Its not your responsibility to be sensitive to this obviously and you have every right to get upset at them (Depending on context).... But, if you are close to them at all it might be worth having a talk about it instead of you just secretly disliking that quality about them. Usually they are like that as a result of their environment or a past incident."
"Maybe try making them embarrassed, flustered, or panicked, people react reliably to those emotions."

I’ve thought about that myself.

An insecure person
"I recently realized that when I was giving myself negative self-talk, I always said ""You're so stupid, you're so (insert negative adjective)"". I decided to switch to saying ""I'm so stupid etc"" and it just sounded silly to me because I know I'm not stupid. I think I had been replaying bad things that had been said to me in childhood. My negative self talk has really gone down and a happy side effect was I've pretty much stopped putting myself down to others."

"Hey some kids actually do walk pretty much instantly but it's not necessarily a good thing. I have twins and they skipped the crawling milestone and went straight to walk/run at 10-12 months. Found out it's because they had a crossing the mid line problem that resulted in difficulty with reading/writing that we work extremely hard on to keep them equal with peers. But plus side, that have a vocabulary that's 4 or 5 years ahead of their peers and math skills 3 or so years ahead of the class. Every kid has their strengths and weaknesses and it's great to be proud of them but that doesn't make them any better than any other kid. Just a different brain navigating a different meat lump through life. As parents we should really support each other and help all children reach their highest potential, as the old saying goes ""it takes a village to raise a child"". Kids need positive reinforcement from adults and not to be pitted against each other on ""who can do this or that first"" really not good for the kid's self esteem at all and can cause a lot of anxiety hearing their parents talk like that to other parents."

Immediately after he grabs his bag and starts walking off, but not before turning to give me a death glare and loudly muttering ""Don't you DARE touch my hand"". I do try to avoid touching anyone while handing them change, but it happens. No one else has even reacted to it, let alone been visibly furious about it.

"What If their decision is still wrong though? For example my parents sometimes compliment me for how studious I am, when in actuality I have a HUGE problem with procrastination, am behind some subjects in school, have no fucking idea of what I'm going to make of my future, cram for tests instead of actually studying for them, and most I'm able to do is get passable grades. This excluding the other messed up stuff about me my parents don't know. It's just so crushing when they think so highly of me."

Years later, I found out that the one I originally didn't know as well was completely lying about everything (self-harm, suicidal thoughts, random panic attacks) except for his anxiety, which he could not exaggerate beyond the reality. He told me that the only reason he participated was because he wanted the other kid to shut the hell up, and beating him in suffering the most was just satisfying. Sigh."
"Quick question... I told a close friend about how I was proud of myself for being very extroverted and I said I felt like I was (kind of) the life of the party.

MM, two males, not FF, two females. How does reading a romance novel about TWO MEN in any way make me a lesbian? And even if I AM attracted to women, I obviously AM attracted to my husband, so that would make me identify as bisexual, or pansexual, NOT lesbian. But I'm not attracted to women, and I don't know why he had to ask me more than once. Does he seriously think I would lie about it?"

"Back in the 90’s, I worked as an RN at a small rural hospital that had one male House Supervisor, who received a ton of abuse from husbands not happy that this dude was calling their house to speak with their wives (who were nursing staff)  One such wife nearly lost her job when she was on-call and the House Supervisor called for her to come in - they ended up having to find someone else to come in to work because her husband was convinced that “We need your wife to come in and take care of patients” was actually code for “I need your wife to meet me at the Holiday Inn for drinks and sex” so he didn’t tell her that the House Supervisor was on the phone.....  She was told to get her husband under control or she would no longer be working at our hospital....  My friend’s ex-husband also used to make shitty comments about that same male House Supervisor, about how he didn’t believe that he wasn’t sleeping with at least one woman at work - funny how the House Supervisor guy was totally faithful to his wife but my friend’s husband became her ex- because she caught him in their bed with his female coworker...."

"&gt; How about you put all that hate you have for immigrants and poor people and aim it at the ones that hire them and create more poor people.  Firstly, I don't hate anyone, especially not for something as simple as being an immigrant or poor. Secondly, who says I'm not aiming disdain towards those corporations. Corporations that are given exception by the government and not held to the same standards as small businesses.  &gt;What do you think will happen if people refuse to work for a salary that doesn't even feed your family or pay the rent?  Which is why we should limit the amount of those types of people.  &gt;They hire the ones that are willing to live off noodles and share a living space with 20 other people because the alternative is death in their own country.  Except it isn't. The majority of immigrants come looking for a better life, but that doesn't mean they're in some sort of danger in their country of origin. People come here for work and education that they're not afforded elsewhere.  &gt;Either by the cartel or by actually starving to death.  Have you ever actually been to Central or South America? Unless you're Venezuelan, the chances of starving to death are slim to none and cartels are more of a problem along the border.  &gt;The only way for those in charge to keep us from pointing fingers at them is to give us someone else to point our fingers at.  If conditions are so bad in these places, why not put pressure on those in power to change it? Why must it be our responsibility to accommodate and care for those whose government won't?"

Yeah like I am extremely insecure but that's kind of why I got rid of social media too-- it was just a massive reminder of my isolation.
I have a friend that talks about the girls he have slept with in the past in full detail anytime a cute girl walks by as if I’m listening to him. Like he can talk 20 minutes straight just about one girl he slept with.   I’ve told him a couple of times a true gentleman never kiss and tell but he doesn’t understand that logic.  Edit: for real his story can start like this: “Oh that girl is cute! It’s like the time when I had sex with a girl and she came 5 times in two hours I shit you not bla bla bla bla... *“20 minutes later”* ...I swear she said I’m the biggest she’s ever been with!” Then standing there with a stupid smile as if he want to jerk of his own story.

I had a really pretty coworker who was nice to everyone and never talked negatively about anyone. Every older woman on our team would be so mean to her and accuse her of being a slut behind her back. I don’t work with her anymore but she was the best work friend I ever had and didn’t deserve to be treated like that.
"Except most of the people at the southern border ( many of whom are women and children ) are fleeing from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, three countries that have suffered at the hands of US intervention propping up violent groups into power during the cold war. Economic migrants are generally working individuals, not unaccompanied children and families.   also lets ignore the fact that we were talking about globalism broadly and not about 'economic migrants' and lets say they were, as you purport, 'economic migrants' what would be the best way to deal with that? Shove them into concentration camps? Put up a giant wall that even if it were to be effective, even if it were to be legal (to the first, it isn't. To the second it [probably] isn't) would just transfer the crisis to one of our primary allies in trade, Mexico, a country who isn't equipped to deal with it from either an economic or humanitarian perspective, and who isn't responsible for the crises of the host countries in the first place (spoiler alert the USA **is** to both.  edit: also you know the best way to prevent a mass influx of 'economic migrants'? Improve the economies of the countries they're coming from, guess what? Globalism does that, it also improves our economy. The only problem with that is that it improves it for the rich disproportionately and hurts parts of the working and middle classes (while still improving most peoples conditions working and middle class included) So I'll ask, which party cuts taxes for the rich, and is against pretty much every social program again?"

Her ex is incredibly lazy with no work ethic but my gf enables it by helping her out with rent and giving her rides to work instead of having her get her own car. I finally told her that she's enabling her ex's bad behavior and she wont be happy as long as she has her leeching off her and giving nothing back. She finally listened to me, her ex got her own car and is working on moving out."

"The thing that gets me the most in this behavior is people that intentionally block both lanes when approaching a merge point.   Please pardon me while I yell:  YOU ARE DOING THE WRONG THING. TAKING BOTH LANES IS BOTH MORALLY WRONG AND INCORRECT BEHAVIOR. YOU ARE NEITHER THE POLICE NOR A TRAFFIC ENGINEER! IF THE POLICE OR TRAFFIC ENGINEERS WANTED TRAFFIC TO BE A SINGLE LANE WHERE YOU WERE, THEY WOULD HAVE ARRANGED THE TRAFFIC DEVICES THAT WAY.   Rant ~~over~~ stepped down a notch.  Maybe they feel smug about blocking people passing them in the lane that's going to end. But no, people merging early are either just taking the chance to get into the lane and not stress about it, or ignorant of the fact that using both lanes to the merge point is the optimal scenario. People who block both lane suck."
"I mean... damn though. What a jaded out look. If people had only helped me if they knew all the shit I was actually dealing with.... I would probably be dead. A lot of people being raped by a family member aren't openly discussing it... the fact that you assume the person you ""know"" has suffered is suffering more then the person who you aren't sure why they're suffering is... icky. I have PTSD (due to sexual violence, does me telling you that make it more valid for you?) too! And a service animal, or how you patronisingly put it an emotional support animal, would be really helpful for me. Good to know people look at them as useless measures of narcissicm.

"I dealt with this level of jealousy for a long time. I think it's because my mom cheated on my dad for years, and only I knew about it (I was a little kid). A lot of guilt and confusion there. Maybe that wasn't it, I don't know. But anyway, once I *drum roll, please* cheated on my boyfriend, I had a real moment of clarity. It's not about ""opportunities."" It's about whether or not you're a shitty person (AKA whether or not you consider how your actions affect others before you do them.) If someone's gonna cheat on you, it doesn't matter if the other party is four inches away or across the world."
Not in my experience. But we can agree to disagree.
Yeah this is basically me. I try to relate to people like “oh yeah a similar thing happened to me where...” but then I read stuff like this and I’m like ok I guess I’m just an asshole.

"Before I was diagnosed with my mental illness I thought I was just a bad, lazy, useless person. Others around me used to always ask, ""What is wrong with you?"" and I had no logical answer. However, when I was diagnosed it really helped me in that I didn't feel like it was all my fault/a moral failing. It also meant that I could be taught how to live with it which gave me hope.  Perhaps they were telling someone about their mental illness not out of pride, but more of an explanation for perceived missteps they have taken. Both are out of insecurity, of course, but this might offer an alternative explanation that could be driving them."

I would tell myself I'm smarter and better than everyone to justify the fact I had no friends and couldn't keep a woman.  I really believed that shit until I lost a woman I really love about 3 weeks ago.  The worst part is that I don't have a chance to be the new me for the woman who caused it.  Insecurity is a lonely road.

"Sure. The problem with derogatory language is, in most cases, not it's *intent*, but it's *effect*. If you and you're friends are throwing around words like the f-word or the n-word, you don't know what effect it has on your gay or black friends, because its very possible that they're not confortable speaking out against it in the contxt of a group that seems to have otherwise accepted them.  Over time, though, hearing some part of your identity constantly used as an insult can be pretty psychologically damaging."

"I always liked the self deprecating jokes, especially penis size wise. It is funny to see the reaction of confusion people have when you say your penis is 2 inches hard 3 inches flaccid... stupid and it always makes me laugh. I don’t know why, kid humor stayed with me, I guess.   But there was this time in my life when I was really depressed yet I didn’t know how bad I was. But people saw it, as things like this are somehow evident. And it affected my jokes. I was with a bunch of people and then I said something that for me was the usual self roast jokes I was used to do, but no one laughed. And awkward ensued.   It was then that I realized people only laugh at self deprecating jokes when you pass the sense that it is indeed a joke. And when you say something you express as being the truth, even if not in a conscious level, people will notice it and the comedy flips to a tragedy."

What does that have to do with insecurity tho
"I was exactly like this from this time I was 12 until I was 17. (I’m now almost 20) What really threw me out of my CRAZY elaborate lies that I truly believed were real at some points was when my friends found out I was lying and I just about lost everyone after the worst emotional mind beating from one of my friends just screaming at me (this happened on my birthday, which I now find kind of funny because what started them figuring it out was a picture I sent from my birthday the year before but it clashed with a lie I had made and forgot about.)   I am so so sooo glad I don’t do it anymore, sometimes I still feel very compelled to lie to people I just met but I just hold myself back from talking a lot because I’ll just say something that isn’t true that I do not want to say."
Showing that any comment about anything makes you upset.
"I know exactly what you mean, especially with the hobby bit. Whenever I have to introduce myself and tell a group about me I have no idea what hobbies to say because I feel like I'm not good at anything enough or don't do it frequently  enough to claim it. Like photography or gardening or whatever. I'm getting better at just owning it and saying yeah, I do those things.  I can also relate this to music back when I was a kid pre internet. The amount of poser talk and gatekeeping kids did about genres or bands or any of that was so insane I never was able to just say what I liked because I didn't feel like I ""earned"" it. That is so flipping stupid thinking about it now but back then it seemed like such a big deal and how it ""worked""."

"I'm in a similar boat. These days I don't really care what people think of me so I do not lie very much any more but back when I was in school, I would always lie to not be the outcast. When I lie about something I really want the other person to believe to not know, I myself become convinced that I am telling the truth. Even something like when I would fake an injury and limp, I would continue to limp even when I was alone and no one was watching me because I had convinced myself I was actually injured.   I do not see it really as a problem and especially not one to have therapy over since I am in control of what I'm lying about. I know lying isn't something good but it was simply a way of forgetting how much I hated my self and life back when I was school and forming a perfect but realistic life for myself while I was in school. But once again I rarely lie anymore since I have adopted an attitude where I simply don't care about anything."

"I'm not op but as someone who does the same thing I think a lot of it is about the safety of that clothing choice. For example, I'm trans (mtf) and over the past 3 years I've been been amassing a wardrobe of feminine clothes, yet I still feel most comfortable wearing androgynous stuff, specifically the army jacket I thrifted and patched up which I almost never leave the house without. Why? Coz it's better in my mind to b wearing a nice but low key outfit that's androgynous, than to be wearing any feminine clothing because I'm deathly afraid that I'll attract more attention to myself in it, which by extension will get more people trying to figure out what gender I am/if I pass; whereas, in the androgynous outfit, people don't know what gender I am and they leave it at that, or even better they just don't think about it.  Kinda specific, but even if I was to take being trans out of it I'm just not comfortable putting myself on display to be judged, and that's what wearing flashy clothes feels like. I also don't have any friends so when I choose an outfit I have no one to do a litmus test on my look, it's just my judgement influencing it, which I'm not so confident in."

And if I do manage to get a word in, I'm not allowed to finish because someone has something relatable that is important enough to cut me off.  My wife does it to me a lot and I don't know if she genuinely thinks I was finished or she just doesn't really care for what I have to say. She gets kind of upset when I prefer to text because I know at least when I text, she has no choice but to read everything I say.  I ultimately just shut up and don't say anything, if I'm with other people, I casually just slip away and go home. If I'm with my wife, I get asked for the next half hour if everything is okay because I've sudden gone quiet."

"God, I just remembered one of my coworker friends. We had a Halloween decor contest last week and some of them were so  competitive to the point of being toxic that it sucked. We were all having lunch one time and we weren't talking about the decors at all when this guy started trash talking about the decors we've put up (that we spent a lot of work on after office hours). Everytime there's a contest, this guy will never fail to just start talking shit and he never ever took a break to just compliment or say something nice.  Any other time he's a bit tamer, but still throwing out jokes on other people's expenses regularly. It's gotten to the point where I just ignore any non-serious things he says."

Constantly dropping into the conversation things about your significant other that aren't related to the conversation. Guess it kind of goes with people attempting to dominate the conversation
Honestly (and not to get too self aware) asking for an example of what could be considered an insecurity
If I scratch and tweek and sniff when I speak.
Trump.
"I became the wild child in college, but it was a top 15 school, and that lead to my current job, which pays far better than anything i’d Have gotten going to a state school."
Was that a micro aggression?
Piers Morgan
Can't say I've ever heard anyone say that. What an odd phrase to scream.
"I was like this in my teens. Changed for the better and never looked bag. Living a lie is fucking terrible. Well, *lies* in my case..."
"Everyone should just stand up and leave, sounds like the prick deserves it."
What a dick!
Is this different from rambling on and on because I'm socially awkward and dumb?
The cool kid at school acting like you just murdered their dog after telling them to step on legos
"Me too, everything but being fun :("
Compensating too much for things you’re insecure about. Or just constantly asking people for affirmation.
Having to turn the lights off during sex
Someone who is very secure about the fact that they are insecure.
"A couple with a joint social media account.  More specifically, the person in the relationship who decided they wanted that."
Yes.
A little to well
People who consistently search out things that are wrong with something. They never talk about the good things! They just get a kick out of hating things and it makes their already shriveled-up self-esteem feel momentarily better to get some sense of moral or societal superiority for hating something. (Particularly people who hate popular things because they apparently can't stand other people having fun.)
Flipping off a group of women in outer space?
Screaming “I’m very insecure”
Having those big wheels on your ford
"People who jump into a conversation just to correct the spelling and grammar of others, instead of just assuming a typo or accepting the information was communicated anyway (or even *asking* first); the need to feel smugly superior over a piddly detail tells me all I need to know."
"The last day of my first semester of college our friend group had been going through some internal fighting and we decided we would all sit down together and get everything out. We sat in a circle and would go around with one person being the subject and everyone would say something that annoyed them about the person and something that they appreciated about the person. Some people took it a little more personally than others, some changed their behavior and some didn't but overall it was a good bonding experience and did a lot to get over the troubles we were having. It really showed me a lot about the misconceptions I was having about what was going on in the group too."
"I have a guy at work who does this. Every thing we talked about, he's done that. People tried talking to him about it but he heavily denied it whatsoever."
"Not like attacking because that's different, but if someone makes a small joke at your expense or a lighthearted jab and you get super defensive and start arguing with them and making a scene."
"Joint Facebook accounts where the ID is both their names. Screams, “one of us had an affair or I’m afraid one of us will.”"
Boring is better. Now one of those guys is in Jail for participating in a street race that killed two girls and an infant. His baby mama started dating his best friend a few months later. Extra drama. One of the others is doing very well tho. Not everyone carries their highschool drama throughout life. But some do.
"no its just because its something that never gets talked about.  imagine the outrage if, in america at least, all women had their labia removed/reduced drastically at birth. then realize there's a law preventing that. *then* realize theres no such law for men and the same thing happens every day in the hundreds.  and then the best part is the classic woman defense ""but it looks better"" which i've heard countless times lmao"
Trying to make something funny but we evaluated on it more and more unless making it cringe. Then trying to save that.
"Exactly! Both narcissists and histrionics thrive on drama, but only narcissists believe they are best things that have ever lived. Sociopath and psychopath are also very misused terms. Both of them are pretty much never used correctly, but to be fair, psychology is quite confusing."
"I do something similar. I usually point out my flaws, especially when meeting someone new, ones I am and aren't comfortable with. It give me more confidence once it's out there, but also give the other person the illusion of confidence, but not in a self absorbed way"
Masturbating alone instead of with others
"What's not ""normal"" about the one I posted above?"
"People that follow trends, like using the same clothes, brand, as everybody just because it is new and popular, buying the last iphones, etc, to feel they belong to an specific group."
Asking how your current bfs/gfs ex partners performed sexually and only wanting to hear what you want to hear.
People who do good deeds but then have to tell everyone about it.  The need for external validation is a big red flag for me.
Selfies

"not always, but usually yeah."
Getting defensive over broad statements
Exactly this.  I used to feel pretty smart.  Till I found myself in a study group for my topology course with this guy named James.  The ease with which he blew through the material was just unreal.  Every time we met it was just the group of us asking him questions and him basically teaching a secondary class about whatever the topic of the week was.  I'm sure he's off working at JPL or something now.   Was the first time in my life that I felt genuinely and wholly intellectually inferior to a peer.
"Had a friend who, while I took a nap, texted me   ""I noticed you didn't share your chocolate bar with me at lunch. Are you mad at me? Are we even friend anymore?"" 2 hours later, ""I guess I have my answer."""

"I was just about to say the same thing. This is a trait that is often seen with Aspbergers. When they're actually comfortable enough to talk to you, they'll just ramble on and on about themselves or things they like. And they have a tough time picking up that someone is bored of their topic. Or they DO pick up on the fact that someone is bored, and they simply do not care because they must complete their chain of thoughts."

Bragging on social media about how many people you’ve had sex with
Shared social media accounts.
"For real. I don't hate on anyone doing what they want to do with their own money. I do have to fight the urge to feel a bit judgy about my bro and his wife though because they spent a lot on their wedding and I know they can't afford it. I don't say anything but it stresses me out seeing that vapid, materialistic bitch blowing $600 on a pair of Christian Louboutin's she'll wear once when my brother has to pay for half of it, and he's too much of a pushover to say no.  Not really my business until he comes asking me for money though so I just keep my mouth shut unless I'm rambling to some internet stranger right now."
"Similarly: when the guy makes it his Special Mission to give you an orgasm (after you haven't had any with him yet and despite you reassuring him that sex isn't about the orgasm for you but about the connection). You know, in a *""I have to succeed at this otherwise I'm not a real man""* kind of way rather than him feeling concerned for you or something. My ex was like that: he focused so much on trying to give me an orgasm (especially a vaginal one) that I kind of began to feel pressured to have one and stopped enjoying having sex with him. It ended up being one of the many reasons for why I broke up with him."

"&gt; Except most of the people at the southern border ( many of whom are women and children ) are fleeing from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, three countries that have suffered at the hands of US intervention propping up violent groups into power during the cold war. Economic migrants are generally working individuals, not unaccompanied children and families.  Well they were offered asylum in Mexico, but that wasn't good enough for them. [There were also plenty of Africans in that caravan.](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/768032924/african-migrants-stuck-in-mexico-plan-to-march-toward-u-s) And so what if they're women in children? Why are they our burden? Either way, it's not true. The largest immigrant age-sex group from Mexico is men between the ages of 40 and 44.  &gt;And lets say they were, as you purport, 'economic migrants' what would be the best way to deal with that?  By not letting them in.  &gt;Shove them into concentration camps?  Comparing detainment centers to concentration camps is spitting in the faces of the 11 million people that died in actual concentration camps.  &gt;Put up a giant wall that even if it were to be effective, even if it were to be legal (to the first, it isn't. To the second it [probably] isn't)  To both, it is.  &gt;would just transfer the crisis to one of our primary allies in trade, Mexico, a country who isn't equipped to deal with it from either an economic or humanitarian perspective, and who isn't responsible for the crises of the host countries in the first place  Then they can kick them out as well. Besides, Mexico offered asylum to anyone that needed it, but they didn't want it. They wanted to be in the US because they're not actual refugees.  &gt;(spoiler alert the USA is to both.  The USA caused a drought in Honduras? Damn, I knew we were powerful, but not that powerful."

"No, you said as much by talking about how women gossip when men apparently don’t, have “strategic friendships” (i.e. manipulative and shallow) and are apparently taxing and prone to causing drama. I simply condensed that down for the sake of brevity. It’s pretty easy to read between the lines; everyone has heard this same spiel from “not like other girls” types hundreds of times. That’s why it was cited as an example of insecurity and heavily upvoted in this thread."

"It was my previous job, and there was literally 1 woman working there out of 50 employees or so in the depot, and she worked upstairs in admin.  People were generally more sensitive around her, but occasionally she could be as bad as anyone."
"It could be insecurity--but from my experience with several therapists over the last 2 decades, not enough weight is directed towards how that level of self-deprecation is just as much a non-physical mode of self-harm as it is a self-defense mechanism. It took a lot of ugly crying to accept the reality that not all self-harm is cutting, drinking, drugs, and physical scars."
"Oh god... This reminds me of this group I was apart of, it's a military spouse/mom group. It was great until this one lady joined, she was a CO's wife, and basically a clique formed around her, and the social dynamic got weird. She had these parties and seemed to make a point of not inviting three of us, but inviting EVERYONE else, and apparently it turned into a really bad gossip/rumor feast.   It kinda came to a head when a very good friend who had been struggling to get her daughter seen by a specialist, which took forever to sort out for a multitude of reasons including getting posted in the middle of the process, finally got a date for her daughter's surgery. This woman (the CO's wife) who barely knew my friend had the gull to tell her that, it was obvious something was wrong with her daughter, and it was her fault for ""not listening"" to ""any of us"", and she had no one to blame but herself for getting the surgery so late... Um what... Turns out she and her clique had been gossiping about how the kid couldn't walk behind her back and no one thought to actually talk to my friend about it, and so had no idea about the troubles they'd been through and had just assumed that she'd been doing nothing (nice eh?).  The thing is, that this woman said all this very publicly on Facebook under the post my friend made about her daughter needing surgery... Anyone who actually knew my friend (an early childhood educator) and their family well knew this was complete BS, and it soon became very apparent that she was an uninformed bitch. The other thing about her being a CO's wife is her husband is responsible for her and she needs to ""represent the military in a favourable way"", it's a big no-no to embarrass the military, and he got in serious trouble because of all the nasty shit she said... I may have helped that along by making sure it came to the admiral's attention... She also got talked to about her behaviour at the military family resource center (where the group met officially), and was threaten with being cut off from being able to use the center of she was going to be a bully.  And shortly after none of the people who were in the clique came to the group anymore. So it worked out, but honestly who does that, like WTF? She and the rest of the clique, were so insecure they had to gossip about someone's disabled kid, and make up shit about the situation to make themselves feel better?"
"This is not to be confused with trying to move the conversation forward. For example, if my friend is telling me about his trip to Japan, I will listen about his trip FIRST, ask him how it went, what crazy things did he see, was their any culture shock? And then I could follow it up with ""that's awesome, that reminds of the time I went on vacation to (x) country, it's crazy how different it is etc. And then try to tie it back to his trip in some way.   DO NOT, cut him off when he's said little to nothing about his vacation and then begin to talk about how you went on vacation and then let the conversation end there. I have seen this happen too many times and it's so unbelievably awkward for everyone except the dumb fuck who can't understand how he made everyone uncomfortable."

Its frankly relieving to get to point where it doesn't make you feel certain ways talking about it. I promise so many more people will understand than don't. But everybody has their own custom timeline for it. I hope you start feeling better before touch time passes

"While I can't discount that, he's definitely also very insecure, and is quite an ""attention gluton"". I don't want to get into specifics, but I have plenty of reasons to think that.  But you're right, if he is on the spectrum then I can't fault the guy for not picking up on social cues."

Unless your partner has cheated or crossed boundaries before it means you feel insecure about yourself and therefore threatened by other people.

"In this case, some people are just introverts.  For instance, I barely make eye contact, but it is only because I want to. I also have absolutely no problem looking at people in the eye, and I am good at it if I need to. I often stand in the corner because I do not want to talk to people, am not interested in what they're doing, or don't want to at all. I understand when people invite me into their group, but sometimes (most of the time, actually), I just want to be alone. If I want to talk to people, I'll do it myself."
"This is something that appears more in the art/fashion/creative world: Always mentioning, “It took me x amount of time to do this.”, when showing people your work. As if the time spent on something indicates how good it is.   I work in fashion and sometimes people would kind of brag about that it took them several weeks to make something. It usually shouldn’t take you more than a few days to finish this ... you’re just showing that you can’t do it properly.   I don’t know anyone who is good/professional in any creative field who does this."
"Yup, massive debt. Sky-high car payments, which come with sky-high insurance payments. They live in a fancy apartment but can't actually afford to furnish it so they overpay like crazy decking the place out with rent-to-own furniture.  And all that stuff is basically worthless-- it depreciates in value faster than you pay it off.  Even your $60k dodge challenger is only going to be worth like $18-22 by the time you get done paying it off, and then of course you have to turn right around and buy another one because you can't look like a peasant rolling a 2013 model year in 2019.  What's sad is a lot of these people will overspend so much on frivolous things like cars and high interest rates that after 20 years they'll have virtually nothing to show for all that work whereas the people around them who just stayed within their means live in a $300k house that's paid off or close to it."
"&gt;Lack of confidence where they should have confidence (subject matter experts, career knowledge, sports expertise) is a huge indicator of insecurity.  Impostor syndrome is a bit of a tricky thing. There are often good reasons for experts not speaking ... with certain audience. Mount stupidity, and realizing their own ignorance. It's precisely they *do* have confidence about the topic they don't *dare* to to dumb it down for laymen. Being an educator and popularizer is an entire new talent, not just ""not being insecure""."

Everyone is insecure, but honestly one of the biggest signs of an insecure person is if they think insecurity is the motivation for another person's actions.  Especially when we're talking about assholes, it's comforting to think that some inner pain is the reason they act the way they do-- coz that implies that the people who ""aren't assholes"" are virtuous, able to withstand their own insecurities without turning into a dickhead. But some people just are assholes, for a variety of reasons."

"Jesus Christ did we date the same person. My ex Jas would always do this to me. Got to the point where she was reading my messages from my ex girlfriends from when I was dating in HIGHSCHOOL (we were at university at the time/working full time jobs)  After we broke up I looked in my blocked people in Facebook and just had all these girls she had decided to just block on my account. A couple of them were exe's but exes I was still friends with (mainly because I dated them 5-7+ years ago by that stage). She also blocked a lot of my guy mates for God knows what reason.  I should have left when they cut themselves and blamed it on me. (Was trying to leave them) Then had the nerve to gaslight me and tell me I was emotional abusing her when I was trying to get help for suicidal thoughts and depression. (I thought a lot of my mates just stopped talking to me, as I wrote before she was just blocking people left right and center she either felt insecure around or even guys that she didn't like and wouldn't even attempt to get to know, this over almost three years had a pretty bad impact on my psyche)   So so happy I'm out of that relationship now. Holy fuck I learnt a lot about red flags there.  Unfortunately the next girl I almost fell in love with turned out to be an escort almost the whole time and lied about a lot of that stuff constantly. I wouldn't have even cared but she wasn't transparent with me so oh well. Fuck I guess I just needed to rant haha, sorry guys."

And I'm the same way (while making an example in this very reply, lol), if something reminds me of something I'm excited about, I WANT to share it because it feels good. I have to really work on it. The memory problems are also a good factor. You aren't purposefully doing this.   It looks like you are making great progress as you are aware of an issue and are taking steps to fix it. The more you work with ways to change it, the easier it'll be to interact with people normally. (BTW, I have the EXACT same issue, so I am not talking down to you.

"Yeah you make some good points but the thing is all of the friends I have are very vocal about how they feel which then establishes to us what their boundaries are. I/We never cross any or each other’s  boundaries.   I’ve got friends that aren’t so sensitive about things like that and so there’s obviously a bit of banter between us which can include derogatory comments coming from all sides as you gotta take as much as you can give (FYI I can take jokes about my race, sexual preferences etc but I’ll also give it back as much. But that’s how you gauge and filter your friends right?). But to those friends that are sensitive, well then of course it’s not gonna be in the conversation as i respect their feelings.   This may or may not be dependent on my location (Melbourne, Australia) but I feel it also helps to have a wide range of friends from different walks of life to know and understand different personalities. It also helps to have a sense of your environment socially as well. Similar to what I said in an earlier comment, having a one size fits all attitude may be good and well on paper but doesn’t really cut it in the real world amongst people who have had different upbringings.   EDIT: Grammar and words"

I really hope we don't start to believe our self-deprecating jokes. It becomes your internal voice and does more damage to your self esteem.

They just agree with everybody else, because they’re scared if they contradict others nobody will like them.

And does he have to tell her where he goes? Nope. He runs around with his friends and goes to strip clubs while she isn't even allowed to hang out with certain friends anymore because they have before in their lives smoked or drank. He calls them ""bad influences"" - he himself smokes **and** drinks.    And, to make matters worse, he has cheated on her before multiple times - even had relationships with other girls that lasted more than a year. While being married.

Refreshing your fb page all day on your birthday to see how many people wished you Happy Birthday...
Constantly posting about their lives and what their doing on social media. Also going in and out of relationships and being passive aggressive about them after you broke up.
"Talking about how big your penis is and how great you are at sex. From my experience, they're usually smaller to average size and just ok at it."
"Yes, exactly. How is this a result from insecurity?"
"Yes, exactly. How is this a result from insecurity?"
"Just have little goals and congratulate yourself for achieving them.  Maybe a goal could be complimenting a stranger on something you like, remember you have to like it though (no lying). Even obscure, uncomplimentable things are worthwhile. Maybe you like someone's shoes or the way they write their name or the way they run up a staircase idk, just if you see something you like, tell them.  Another could be having small talk, maybe with a barista or something. Costumer service people don't judge cause I can guarantee you they only think of the people that have been mean to them, and don't think that the conversation is insignificant, you're just practicing and they'll forget if you stammer a little bit, you're just working things out. Eventually try to work this up with regular people, and then set a goal to talk to more people or possibly a more sensitive topic. It's up to you to set goals you think are important, and remember that socialising is many different skills, so no matter how ""easy"" or dumb they feel, you're just trying different things.  Finally, if eye contact is seriously a problem for you, start from the bottom and work your way up. Have a conversation with yourself in the mirror and try to pinpoint where and why you lose eye contact. Maybe it's when you lose your train of thought or make a mistake, try to unlearn these coping strategies. Work your way up then, make eye contact with a pet or a child, then maybe your parents or siblings, then a friend, then a customer service person, then a stranger. You'll find that there's nothing different about all these different interactions except for now you perceive and react to the difficulties presented."
This is totally not real  If you and your friends are at the park sitting down in the grass and your girlfriend starts sitting down on the grass with a sad face on and your friend tries to talk to them and overall tries to cheer them up because they dont want them to be sad and your not doing anything anyways so who are you to talk and you think your good friend of 4 years is flirting with your girlfriend even though we've been friends for 5 years anyways but i guess that doesnt fucking matter but now you want to fight your friend even though you know that i would never even do that dominick but now you've just ruined your friend ship. Meanwhile your friend jacob has apologized and tried to pit the situation behind us but now hes just kinda tired of your shit. Not everyone is trying to steal your girlfriend dominick and even if people were dominick she wouldnt cheet on you or leave you dominick and why would i even be trying to date her we have both been friends for such a long time so why would i try to make the move the second you guys start dating

"For me, I tend to get a little more comfortable talking to people I don't know, talking to my friends or having conversations with the cashiers at mall shops, than I do talking to my own family."
your friend is in a severely abusive marriage. he needs a lawyer and he needs to leave her. he is doing so much harm to his kids by allowing them to grow up seeing their mother abuse him. being a partial custody parent isn't that big of a deal. they are fucking up their kids for life by exposing them to that level of toxicity and abuse.

Trying to get him out of it, but sadly she's really done a bang up job on the isolation and convincing him that no one else will love him/he is worthless and she's the only girlfriend for him."
"Somewhat recently (a few months ago), when I did this, the person I said it to agreed with my self-deprecating “joke” completely unironically. I mean... I say that stuff because I think people already thinking it, and I figure I’m just staying one step ahead. But I definitely don’t like having my suspicions confirmed, especially since I try to aim for something worse than what people are probably thinking."

"I used to try and justify to some girlfriends that guys/girls can't be platonic friends. Then I got many platonic female friends. Then I tried to justify that guys/girls can't be platonic friends after they've dated or slept together. Then I made platonic female friends that I've dated and/or slept together with. I had a birthday party with 4 girls I'd been with all getting along, and at that point I had to admit that I've just been an insecure bugger for a long time and should just keep my mouth shut."

"I've fallen into this but it's not like people with this insecurity choose to feel that way, they may genuinely feel helpless. I'm austistic and I couldn't function well enough to even hold a part time job while living with my abusive asshat of a father, that shit gets depressing after a while and change is hard for me. There's just no guarantee if the familiar hell is more workable than the unknown hell you could be stumbling into."

"This makes me feel a little bit better about my own situation.  I'm at about 3.5 years since my last real relationship and often feel guilty.  I just have a hard time finding someone and feeling close to.  Then there's the fact that the last one took that trust and f$ucked other guys and walked out on Bagheera (""our"" cat) and me."

"Ah yes, the 8 Mile tactic of self degradation. My favorite lmao"
"I never got how that's supposed to work. Like it's known you'll probably feel good doing good things for people,but at the same time you're not supposed to get anything out of it- I'm not sure it's that simple to just turn off the positive reception to that. (That's of course not counting the kind of person to do things just for the public praise rather than because they wanted to help)"
"If he makes all the money he should start hiding it away and look for a way out. It won’t get any better for him, he needs to dip once the kids are old enough to understand it. Sooner or later they will notice that their parents have a shit relationship and it will just conflate the issues.   The fact she won’t go to counseling is a huge red flag that she will fuck him over the first chance she gets, so he needs to prepare for what is coming. You don’t save those kinds of marriages, you just try to survive getting out of them."

"“Not like other girls” is a trope for girls who’s internalized misogynistic beliefs about other women lead them to stereotype them as shallow, gossipy and disloyal.

Once we found out we started practicing and within months they had a massive improvement. For an adult it'll probably take long but hey, it's worth a shot!"

"Maybe a bit, but I think a little bit of insecurity is ok, and actually perfectly normal. I mean, in this crazy world full of uncertainty, expectations, and stress, how could anyone be completely free of insecurities, ya know? Just don't let it consume you."
"Yes! This is a wonderful point. I used to be this way as well. Even just down to little things. ""Have you seen (random movie name)?"" to which I would almost always say either ""yeah a long time ago"" or ""I've seen part of it"" or even just ""yeah"" when, in fact, I hadn't, but I just didn't want to appear uncultured or left out from something big or whatever. fuck that. The road to being comfortable with yourself and who you are is long and challenging but damn it, I'll admit it now when I haven't seen something! It doesn't do any good to pretend otherwise and usually people are happy to fill you in on whatever they're talking about that you aren't familiar with."

"I'm not projecting anything and don't appreciate being ""analyzed"" by some armchair psychologist.   I just find some people (esp on super liberal Reddit) a little naive (or perhaps biased) to not even acknowledge they're putting themselves in somewhat of a risky situation being alone with attractive members of the whatever sex they're attracted to. On the flip side, you really think most single guys/girls who are friends with attractive members of whatever sex they're attracted to don't want to hook up with them? lol.  You can call it whatever you like, but it's not a good idea. It's like a person trying to lose weight (aka stay in a committed relationship) constantly surrounding themselves with sugary foods (attractive single people). It's not going to end well most of the time."

"Being a bully and a gossip. When you gossip and bully others, you are showing your insecurity because you are either projecting your own shortcomings onto them, or you are trying to distract others from your flaws. Also, you are trying to make yourself out to be tougher, smarter, better than what you are and strike fear into your targets. Most bullies are loud, obnoxious and pompous. That, to me, signals insecurity. Anyone who is happy being themselves doesn't have to do any of these things. They can talk to the janitor as well as the CEO and would rather treat others with kindness."
Repeated FB posts about how happy someone is being single.
"The girlfriend of a guy friend of yours that obviously hates your guts for no reason other than you are female.   I unfortunately have been this girl, sadly and shameful to say. It was because I was i secure in the relationship and felt I could lose my boyfriend so easily. Taking a break from dating has really put this in perspective as my guy friends girlfriends hate on me for no reason."
Flexing. Expensive clothes and bags and accesories are fine to a certain extent. Shit you can have 10k watches from Rolex for all i care.   Paying 700 quid for an offwhite belt plus shoes as a high schooler is Just dumb and shows to me that you think wearing cool clothes is going to get more people to like you.

"""IM NOT GAY BUT"" before saying anything"
I think one of the biggest signs of people’s insecurity is their constant bragging of or subtle hinting about how many hours/long of days they work. This is such an annoying competition in the US: who works the most. Just because you work longer hours doesn’t mean you do any better of a job.

Nothing wrong with feeling insecure. You can try hard to avoid insecurity but it’s part of being human.   If you actually don’t feel insecure at all I would say you might be sick and you might need to talk to someone

"First of all, your post does come off incredibly condescending, despite claiming it isn't your intention. I think the reason it's condescending is that you've misunderstood the comment you're replying to.   You're not wrong that children deserve empathy and compassion. A lot of parents absolutely *do* lose their patience too quickly with young children who are still learning how to communicate and how to handle their emotions.   That said, once kids reach the crawling/walking/running stage but can't yet understand why they need to listen to their parents about where they can go and what they need to do, you DO spend most of your time wrangling. I don't think I'd have worded it the way OP did (""you're not really building a relationship with them"" in particular) because you are laying the foundation for the relationship being built, but you get very very little evidence of the results of that effort until they're older.  Mentioned it in another comment, but my son is almost 16 months. Do I explain everything we do to and with him, repeatedly and on a daily basis so he learns words and gains understanding about the world around him? Of course. Do I stay calm when he's angry or sad or scared and explain to him the emotion he's feeling and that I'm there for him? Absolutely. But would I also say that I feel like my days are far more filled with wrangling than building a deep, meaningful relationship with my toddler who, while rather advanced in his language capabilities according to his doctor, still can only say about 10 words correctly and another handful of possible mispronounced words? You bet I would.   There are clearly thoughts in his head, and a budding personality I'm excited to get to know. But until he can express thoughts beyond ""hungry,"" or "" tired"" or ""want that,"" my relationship with him is naturally stunted. That's totally normal for his age, but *man* is the wrangling exhausting compared to the relatively small relational payoff. I think that's all the OP you replied to meant.  I want to make it clear that I adore my son. I am soaking in every moment of this age, because I know it's fleeting. But I am also looking forward to actually knowing him better and hearing him tell me what's on his mind instead of just guessing all the time. 💙"

"Faking issues to get attention because your actual, legitimate issues don't inspire as much sympathy.   ie: My youngest sister is faking traumatic experiences so that she can claim she has PTSD, instead of admitting that she has bipolar disorder and isn't regulating it well.

The irony is, a lot of her older siblings, myself included, have experienced real trauma, and we're regulating fine (mostly fine, mental illness is nothing to just brush over). It's like she's jealous she had a relatively healthy, safe childhood and has nothing to get attention for. She's especially nasty to my mom, who's a fucking saint.   She's finally done enough to be outpatient committed to a behavioral health program, and for my mom to finally kick her out.

From there work on becoming aware of those behaviours and stopping them, and don't be too hard on yourself for fucking up.

Give it time and effort and you'll hopefully realize it getting less over time"
"People who always ask who thier SO is talking to, or taking thier phone and going through it. Or like someone else here said, tracking apps. Also people who accuse thier SO of cheating or lying with extremely vague or poorly conceived scenarios, usually with nothing to support thier claim."

"Im a Lobster that lives in the artic, its totally not secure here, send help"
"Those girls that post "" if you don't like me at my worst.....etc. quotes"" so cringey."
"I’m insecure, and it’s comforting seeing other people owning it in this sub. It’s not a bad thing, it’s just… a thing. One thing that I do when I feel insecure is having talking points that I know I’ve “studied up” on. Because I’m a person whos always needed grades for validation, as I never received true social validation growing up, I approach life like a test that I need to do well on. Sometimes, I bring it back to my home base, and try to relate it to a common experience my friend/potential friend and I have (something that I know is selfish, but I really get anxiety branching too far out). It manifests in me not being a good listener, forgetting names and experiences, and generally avoiding conversation if I can. It sucks, because I struggle to advance relationships I really want to pursue."

"yep, broke up with a girl over this one. I enabled MyFriends or whatever it's called on iOS since I was an uber driver at the time and didnt know the city well and she did. It was supposed to be a security feature in case i got killed or ended up in a bad area of town or whatever. Then one night I decided to play some cards and she flipped out. Scary part is she found out almost immediately when I got there which means she had probably been following my every move for months and not just the occasional checkup. Literally broke up the next day, fuck that shit."
"Yes, but recognizing the problem is the first step towards recovery!"

Sounds more like a lack of social skills or being unaware more than being insecure.
Facebook posts along the lines of “bitches better not be looking at my man” and that sort of thing.
"Maybe even more so, I can imagine."
Cutting other people down on physical traits they can't control or making fun of strangers excessively.
"Over explaining your actions is something common in insecure people. If you’re asked a simple question, give a simple answer. If they want more information than that, they’ll ask more questions."
Dudes that do “Cartman” impressions all the time always seemed incel-y to me
"My girlfriend is frequently trying to get me to be rid of that mindset, if I keep telling myself it could be worse, or that I prepare and think for the worst, what can actually go wrong?"
"I spend a lot of time talking to my sister in law, and my brother in law felt like I was just egging her on against him. I wasn't, I was helping her figure her way back from being irritated with him, but he didn't really accept it until they started bringing me in on speakerphone during fights, and he heard the times when I took his side. He has made a lot more progress since realizing my advice is aimed at compromise, not taking her side."
Hence the humbleness... I think?
"Damn yes! I absolutely feel you there! When I like a show or a musician/band or feel like I love it. Then somehow I meet someone who seems to know EVERYTHING about the actors  or the band members and the history of how it was found and why xy named his dog and where yx jerked of the first time and shit. And I'm just like ""dafuq... I just love the music/show..."", because I only now maybe the leadsinger or where they are from... And then I feeld like I am just a pretender. Without deep investment or passion, just scratching the surface...   Same goes with love in general. I do love. But when I hear how some people talk about how superduperultradeep theire love is and how extremely happy they are and how they think about theire fiancee all the time and can't be without for even a single second... That's that moment when I ask myself... Damn,do you even love? Do you REALLY love? It kinda drags me..."

"I also got over. Unfortunately, I didn’t until my late thirties.   I pretty much wasted my life living in my fantasy world. Oh well, whadaya gonna do, right?"
"I know someone just like this. Will always steal the conversation away from anyone else as soon as she can. Will find even the slightest comparison to change the topic and make it all about her. And she will then talk for the next hour all about herself, and no one can get a shoe in. We try, but then she just raises her voice and talks over you and goes “yeah!” And then will jump back in where she left off. Yet when others talk, she’s disinterested, doesn’t pay attention, rolls her eyes, sits there annoyed. But when it’s all about her, all focus has to be on her. And she often says the same thing over and over, and has re-told the same story half a dozen times, and you have to sit there and let it play out again. You make efforts to walk away, when you think her sentences have wrapped up at certain points, but then she keeps going. It’s impossible to leave conversations with her, and you know when she’s there, you’re just waiting for her to start making it all about her."
"Yeah, I get that too often. Helps me to winnow out my ""friends""."

Comparing yourself to other people.   I hate it so much to shower at the bath house when teens are there because they look at every inch of your body. I feel their eyes on me but when I look they quickly turn away of course.   If you hate your body it won't make you feel better to compare yourself to others. Stop doing it because you come across as a fucking creep.

"I agree and disagree what what you stated. In every job I've worked I've been a manger without being paid a manager wage; because I'm a good worker and I care about the work that I do, and try to be the best that I can be. In every job I've had, I've started out as being hated and as soon as the managers realized I was good at my job, I transisitioned into been the favourite because I don't start drama and I do my job almost perfectly (esp. compared to the rest).  Regardless of the circumstances, in every job I've had -  I've have had asshole managers my whole life - they try to show themselves as caring. Though they only care about their own salary; they ""evaluate and monitor"" workers very personally. By that, I mean, they choose the people they like, whether they are good employees or not. They keep the people they like and treat them like Kings (usually horrible employees). They also keep the employees they dislike, but are good at their job but they treat them like shit. They all quit eventually and it's and endless cycle. Even the ones they like, and are nice to, see the cycle and quit.  I know this whole post sounds narcissistic, but I promise it isn't. It's taken a lot of growth for me to fully realize the ways that I have been used and the ways that people tend to use people."

"Yeah, I was going to post something similiar. I always think about how others feel or going to feel about me, weather it's my physical appearance, or personality. Whenever I want to approach someone, I always have the thought  ""Am I going to bother that person if I talk to them?"" I also fear that they'll think I'm a dork, or a weirdo, and look at me strange. However, as I get older, those feelings are slowly going away, and I eventually learned how to assert myself each and everyday."

"Calling someone a Nazi doesn't even mean anything anymore.  25 years ago when I was in school, calling someone a racist or a Nazi was pretty much the absolute worst thing you could accuse someone of.  You reserved that insult for people who truly demonstrated overt racism and it wasn't thrown about.    In the last three years the left has become so hysterical, throwing these words out at anyone who disagrees with them, that I don't even care about these words anymore.  Being a racist means nothing to me.   Being a Nazi means nothing to me.   I guess I love concentration camps now because I want to see a more secure border."
"On the other hand, I think people who regularly accuse people of being ""one-uppers"" can come across as pretty insecure too.  Sometimes people are impatiently waiting to steal the spotlight, but also sometimes they're just making conversation - they're just responding to an anecdote with their own related anecdote, and they have no intention to ""one up"" anyone. There's stealing someone's thunder, but then there's responding by relating a similar anecdote that just happens to be more extreme.  And in that latter case, at least to me, it's usually the person who perceives it as ""one upping"" who comes across as insecure. Demanding that no one ever respond to a conversation with their own experience if it is more extreme is pretty insecure."

I often will just continue to fill a conversation needlessly, I need to learn to say what I mean concisely and leave it at that. Silence is okay.

"Variation: assumption that anyone who *doesn't* is either hiding something or has no life.  My Facebook is pretty sparse (if I didn't need it professionally I'd consider deleting it), and most it's articles or videos I find and share, with only the most occasional thing about my own life - and even then it's usually pretty fun or light-hearted stuff. I'm not even on Facebook every day.  Apparently, some people find my profile kinda 'creepy' because it's so 'empty'/sparse on my personal life. Or, as mentioned, assume that I'm hiding something or have no life.  We truly live in the era of digital and social media validation - if it hasn't been shared and liked on social media, then did it ever really happen in the first place? It's scary how more and more people implicitly believe, ""No."""

"Littering one's timeline with memes and statuses that contain inspirational or reflective personal lessons that they think the rest of the world needs and only they know ie: ""I've been broken so many times but somehow always find the will to piece myself together and I wouldn't be the person I am today without my past.""   Nobody has all of life's answers (plus, these are usually ripped without credit I notice as a writer). While not all battles are equally vicious, conquering adversity does not entitle anyone to diety status. Someone always will and always has gone through what you have/will in a diff. environment."

It's just so weird people actually struggle with that stuff and you have people like that how sit around and try to one up each other and they definitely are attention seeking/ wanting to be trendy for some weird reason depression and mental illness is in

"You have to get beyond the cynic, finding someone you trust say something positive and truthful about you is just one way to try and help with that. Inevitably, though, you have to be able to do things on your own, to win some battles in your head."
"My son was reading at a kindergarten level when he was 3 years old. Totally taught himself, too. He memorized his school bus route (as in, he could recite the street names and which friends were dropped off where in the correct order) in preschool. He didn't learn to drink from a water bottle until he was almost 5, though, and he doesn't really know how to run. He's in 2nd grade now and has recently been diagnosed with high-functioning autism."
"My ex boyfriend putting a donut around his limp dick as an attempt to have sex with me for the first time, and then proceeding to scream at me when I didn't go along with his ""romantic plan"""
When your telling the truth and people think your lying I think of it as a huge compliment. It means your reality is so good that they think it must be fantasy. One tip though. Tell stories that uplift others and let a friend be the one to tell a boastful story about you.

"I don’t know. I self-roast, but it’s also to let people know that I’m not a narcissist, and that it’s just (both self-deprecating and narcissistic) my style of humor.  I could do something and say: “Well, at least I’m pretty enough to be this stupid,” and it’s fine. People who roast themselves are either super insecure or super ~~arrogant~~ confident."

"I'd prefer that than the old wet fish, but I usually counter pretty fast if I can tell they are being an asshole.   Mind you I had some asshole squeeze the fuck out of my hand when I was just a kid, probably around 12 or so. I had always been brought up to give a firm handshake, but this one day I was meeting my neighbors Dad and he damn near crushed my hand, on purpose. That guy was a tosser."
"My ex and I had it. I rarely ever used it. If I knew she was going home and didn't hear from her for a while, I'd just check to make sure she made it there. Things like that. Also if she went out with friends and forgot to text me that she made it back. It was just a mutual agreement, like hey go have fun, but just let me know you make it where you're gonna end up for the night. Sometimes people forget. I looked at it maybe twice a month at most. I didn't stalk or make sure she wasnt cheating or anything, just sometimes you get a bad feeling if you haven't heard from someone you love and it's nice to be able to check and make sure they made it home instead of having paranoia take over until they wake up.  Edit: as mentioned, I looked probably no more than like 10 times over our 3 year relationship and as far as I know, she never looked bc if she got one of those bad feelings that I didn't make it home or whatever I would get calls until I woke up and answered. I didn't mind it because it wasnt stalking, just checking in when you have an off feeling every few months or so. I don't care if my SO goes out and has fun without me, I just care that she makes it back go whoever's house safe afterwards."
"Funny thing, almost all those tweetdeck accounts post something like ""follow me for more funny/relatable tweets"" under each viral tweet.   Like get out of here with that bullshit, everyone knows all your tweets are stolen."

Bullying.
I used to do this but not on purpose. I quickly quit doing it when my friend told me to stop digging for compliments. It cut deep.
"I feel the need to constantly fill the empty space, I feel it shows how insecure I am with my interactions w people"
Me
"Honestly, there’s two general ways being extremely insecure can show up in a person. They can either be the type that constantly looks for validation and has massive general anxiety, or they can be the type that tries to put themselves on the top of the social food chain, therefore bullying others even to the extreme and needing extensive control. Sometimes those qualities can mesh and swap without mental health support, but that’s pretty rare unless they’re very emotionally intelligent. Just speaking from a textbook standpoint."

"Oh boy, this. I've seen so many men walk away unscathed from their gossip and backbiting, because nobody even thinks such a thing is possible when a guy is talking.    People are hard.  Getting along with people is hard. Both sexes tend to cut men a lot of slack and women very little.  If everyone got the breaks men get, we'd all get along better."
So this is a moment in my life that I never forgot and I’m insecure thinking about it. Talking over my crush. (What happened) -  My friend: What group did you like the most? My crush: Oh I like the se-  Me: The first one was AmAZiNg

"My refusal to have sex. Granted, there haven't been many opportunities."
"My former best friend caught her husband cheating a ways back. It was a single event. Not an ongoing thing. He was overcome with guilt afterward, confessed, cut all communication with the other woman, and was willing to go to couples therapy to fix things.   She spent a lot of time considering divorce, but eventually decided to stay together and try to fix things. This apparently involved installing trackers on his phone and a monitoring app so she could check what kind of text messages he was sending, and sites he was visiting. She also wanted him to quit watching porn altogether, because I guess porn equates to cheating in her mind.  I called her out on it and told her that if shes going to treat him like this, they should just split up. Cheating sucks and it hurts, but your options are to fix the issue and stay together, or split up. Not turn your partner into a lab specimen and keep him under a microscope."

I chose “half time dad” and never looked back. It was either that or never look in the mirror again.
"Wish I could get my dad to realize this. He's trying to start up a new tech company, and asks me and his girlfriend (effectively my step mom) for ideas and suggestions and whatnot...but regularly and routinely gets defensive whenever we start asking clarifying or comparative questions.  Most of them are just variations of, ""Well there are all these other tools that already do this, so what does yours offer?"" - Meant to figure out the angle on which we can promote it, but he gets defensive and personal every time, as if we're trying to attack his digital tech baby, no matter how often I explain the practical reasoning for the questions."
I have two married friends who both have trackers on each other's phones that they check frequently and that screams to me ONE thing: get a divorce. The energy and fights they go through over whether one or the other really went to wal Mart or not is fucking insane. And they BOTH do it to each other so it's not even one person being really abusive or something. It's nuts.

I have a friend that put two huge nuts(the fasteners) on the back of his Miata as a joke. They spark whenever they hit a bump on the road at night.
"This is what I would say before I realized that the reason that I didn’t care was because I didn’t feel like I belonged anywhere, so I was just happy to actually be somewhat included. Even then I wasn’t truly happy with those friends"
I do this but to hear people degrade me so I could feel justified for degrading myself to have people degrade me to justify me degrading myself.......

I sent a girl a message and she didnt reply so 3 hours later I liked her last reply and I'm regretting it hard rn
"Thank you, I ask because I have a friend going through the same thing right now. The boy in this situation is in his first relationship and I'm trying to understand how something like this can persist so I can help him see this is a terrible relationship. But by the sounds of it it's like convincing someone their sense of normal is wrong. Which I believe only he can realize on his own by viewing others."
"I take a lot of selfies and I used to post a lot of selfies too. I still post a ~~good~~ amount every now and then, but I’ve taught myself to control it.   I don’t do it just for others’ praise but for self comparison because I’m incredibly insecure about my weight and how I look.   I know a lot of people, and especially girls, get a lot of flak for posting a lot of selfies and then being deemed vain but a lot of times it can be because they’re insecure."
"I think this is about the fifth time I've seen this exact question, with this exact wording, and the exact same responses.   You know what screams insecurity? Reposting an old question on AskReddit that you know you-ll get no new answer to for a few extra imaginary internet points."
"Basically me, I hate photos of my self to add on top of it so i take very few. Which will usually result in me saying after a photo.  “Yeah fk man i look like shit” just because when someone agrees i hope it softens the blow"
"My brother in law does this habitually. Has destroyed any chance of a relationship with him. Its also contributed to the destruction of his marriage, relationships with his sister, mother and father, extended family and I believe it will destroy what little relationship he has with his young kids.  I honestly hope he can turn it all around and salvage what he has left, but I unfortunately don't see it happening.  (Of course there is so much more to it than this, but I'll be damned if it isn't one of the central pillars of his self destructive naturr.)"

"Blaming anything from major issues to minor inconveniences to perceived slights on bigotry. Maybe someone just had reason to think you were an asshole or that you were being an idiot, and gender, sexuality, religion, nor race had anything to do with it. Maybe your problems don't all have to do with something your conveniently unable to control or change, maybe they can actually be your fault?"
You just have to push past it. Just this evening I was with family and friends and some snippet of conversation came up and I thought of something interesting to say. But of course it wasn’t true. It even occurred to me that the lie wouldn’t hurt so it won’t matter.   This was three seconds of my life completely devoted to keeping my mouth shut instead of telling a fake story.   I have those three seconds a lot. Sometimes even more than once a day. But I can say that I almost never tell the lie.
Boasting and believing that everything you do is better than other people.

okay but that’s really true. When I was a freshman in high school I felt like I needed to post on social media ALL THE TIME just so people knew I was doing things. Now that I’m older I find its better to just live in the moment and not worry constantly about catching a video for Snapchat.

This is probably one of the most accurate statements I’ve read about insecurity.
My friend: sincerely says something incorrect Me: corrects him My friend: iM KiDDinG hAhA
Being insecure and having a megaphone to let everybody know.

"&gt;Overall, whites with a four-year college degree or more education made up 30% of all validated voters. Among these voters, far more (55%) said they voted for Clinton than for Trump (38%). Among the much larger group of white voters who had not completed college (44% of all voters), Trump won by more than two-to-one (64% to 28%).  I am guessing you're safe from that ever happening to you."
"Nope, just what came to mind when I read the ""someone saw what I was reading"" thing. I remember feeling self-conscious when reading some books on the bus. Not porn, per se, but eyebrow-rising novels, for sure: *Lady Chatterley's Lover*, *The Decameron*, or even just *Les liaisons dangereuses*.   I have read *Les onze mille verges*, *Justine*, *Venus in Furs*, and *Contes à faire rougir les petits chaperons* on the subway on my old kindle, and maybe nobody would have cared anyway, but I preferred that extra bit of privacy.  Some books invite comments.   Anyway, I could have said ""ebook reader"", but it's longer and it sounds kinda like saying ""cola-flavored fizzy drink"" instead of just ""coke""."
I pulled my pants down in front of my friend in the 3rd grade. No more words would describe his reaction.
"This resonates with me so much. The criteria part gets to me a lot. I'll assume that someone else loves cookies more than I do, so therefore I only like cookies compared to them.  It's the same reason that anytime I do a survey i barely tick any of the 'extreme' ends (very good/very bad) because I'll overthink what the criteria is for those two."
My cousin is the same way. It has created a negative impact on my and my daughter's relationships with my niece and nephew (her kids). Some moms spoil it for everyone around us.
Thanks for saying this. I started to panic and then I realized this is why I do that.
"I'm 5'7"" and overweight.  I have this friend who I always try to encourage and tell her compliments to make her feel better with her insecurity.   Now, this friend is petite. However, she thinks she looks horrible because she looks thicker than most petite women.   She complains and pouts about it everytime, but I just roll my eyes and compliment her anyway.   It was fine, not until I noticed that she does something everytime we hang out with our friend group. She constantly puts me down because of my weight (by joking) and I do nothing but laugh, to add insult to the injury she does it in a way that she thinks I won't notice. How can I not? She does it everytime.   Anyway, I already explained why it was hard to lose weight because of my hormonal issues but I think they don't really pay attention. People who are insecure also talk about themselves in a way that is overboard, they ask something about your life and it somehow turns into a 30 minute conversation about theirs.  We all got insecurities, but the way you handle it says everything about you.  That's all I gotta say."

"I didn't say it's a confidence thing to beat around the bush specifically, just that I don't have a problem saying no and I'm extremely assertive. I also favor direct communication because I think it's complete bullshit that women around me get to decide what I need to hear and when based on when they think it's ""polite"".  What you're saying is that you wildly overexaggerate others' emotions in your head to the point of preferring them to be indirect and seem less invested in their own feelings, did I get that right..?"
"It's funny because you've done it on this comment too, in a way"
What is it?
"Not sure if this is exactly it, but I’m very insecure and I tend to put people ahead of my needs, I put myself down a lot (intentional self-roasts and such are common) and I try to shy away from any possible conversations because I’m insecure about my personality and whether I’m a good person or not. This ONLY applies to real life for some reason."
"For real, nobody should have to deal with the shame of having their lowpoints in life be posted all over the internet with thousands or millions of complete strangers commenting on how sad/pathetic/etc. their actions were and then just being written off as a shitty person. We ALL do shitty things, and whenever we want to criticize other people, we need to take a long hard look at ourselves and try to empathize with the other person. Lack of empathy is the main reason modern society creates increased levels of depression and suicide especially in younger people where they feel the need to constantly compete and one-up everyone else to look better for the limelight."

"some people are insecure but in an avoidant way. like, they don’t put themselves out there, they’re shy, etc. other insecure people work to gain security by overcompensating so that they can be validated for being funny/smart/attractive. insecurity manifests in a whole lotta ways.  some insecure people are clingy, others are recluse-y"

"&gt; phone has a code and fingerprint, but i also had my wife put her fingerprint in it  I got the new iPhone (downvotes inbound /s), and was going to see if I can add her face to it also, or if she has to do PIN only.  &gt; now windows accounts, that another thing altogether.   Preach! lol. She has her laptop, and I have my laptop and desktop we occasionally share, but is mine. Laptop she doesn't mess with since it's primarily work, but desktop is logged in 99.75% of the time, and she can pop onto it, if she can stand the mess on my desk.  &gt; her profiles are always a mess  Sometimes I don't know how they do it. Log on, 30 seconds later it's broke and the network is now part of a botnet LOL"
This is what I've dealt with for a long time in most social settings. The ironic thing is I'm also incredibly insecure but I've coped with it by forcing myself to be outgoing and confident. I've been perceived as stuck up or just plain bitchy by a lot of people and had lies spread about me well into adulthood just because I'm more extroverted than they are and they're envious of it. It's such a weird thing to be confronted with because it's literally someone asking you to be less of yourself. I've lost a lot of friends this way but they obviously weren't really friends to begin with.

Personally I tend to not talk to lots of people in person because I'm insecure about my looks and conversational skills. I talk to so many people on Snapchat etc but then they end up thinking I don't want anything to do with them because I'm too afraid to talk to them in person. I come across as rude but I'm just scared

"&gt;Well they were offered asylum in Mexico, but that wasn't good enough for them.   No, mexico's asylum program is used heavily, with their crisis with the cartels they are, as I already stated, not equipped the way  we are.    &gt;There were also plenty of Africans in that caravan.  What's plenty to you? Half a percent?  &gt; And so what if they're women in children? Why are they our burden?  fuck it, let em die then.  &gt;Either way, it's not true. The largest immigrant age-sex group from Mexico is men between the ages of 40 and 44.  You realize most of the asylum seekers are not from mexico right? Say 100% of Mexican immigration is single men of working age, what does that have to do with these asylum seekers? you know, seeing as how most of them are not from mexico.  You do realize that saying an immigrant group is from Mexico means that Mexico is their country of origin right? not just where they're crossing from.  &gt;By not letting them in.  cool, now you've got thousands upon thousands of asylum seekers stuck at the border of mexico who will likely die. Or be shipped to cartel areas by Mexican police and dumped to be taken into human trafficking or killed.   &gt; Comparing detainment centers to concentration camps is spitting in the faces of the 11 million people that died in actual concentration camps.  what the hell do you think 'concentration camps' means, does 'internment camps' satisfy your fragile psyche? Also are you really gonna clutch pearls about my use of the correct terminology, when you just suggested we just let these people die?  &gt;To both, it is.  I guess that's why most immigrants come through ports of entry, and I guess that's why a federal Judge ruled it illegal.  &gt;Then they can kick them out as well.  all trumples are psychopaths  &gt; Besides, Mexico offered asylum to anyone that needed it but they didn't want it.  Because mexico is shipping them to dangerous areas, or simply throwing them back south of their own border. &gt; They wanted to be in the US because they're not actual refugees.  No they're asylum seekers, and as such are afforded certain rights under the 1951 Refugee Convention Treaty.  &gt;The USA caused a drought in Honduras? Damn, I knew we were powerful, but not that powerful.  no, they participated in Destabilization of the entire region during the cold war. Which made the countries there ill equipped to deal with drought.... Wait are you saying the people coming from Honduras are doing so because of a drought? wouldn't that make their claims valid? if, you know, they'd die of thirst otherwise?  Go back you your quarentined sub you scum sucker."
"Do confident people really look at quiet people and think that they are the one who is so confident and reserved that they don't have to speak?  If this is true, its absolutely mind blowing.  I always think they are thinking 'why is this person so quiet, i am pouring my heart and soul out here!'"

I don’t really like to talk just for the sake of talking, especially to strangers, especially involving small talk.

"I’m responsible for renting out my brothers house. I didn’t rent to one couple because when they spoke to me it wasn’t eye to eye, they honestly seemed like good people but for some reason they didn’t look me in the eye when speaking.

Honestly I don't trust people who say they can't be friends with women. Stuff like this is why.
"I had a neighbor who I couldn't stand. She would always compliment people. Someone would walk by our apartment compmex and she would just say ""I love your shirt"" ""wow, cool shoes"" ""Those glasses look great""  If I got a haircut, she would at some point, maybe weeks later say ""that new haircut looks great""   I know you may think she is just a nice person but I could tell she was very insecure. Thanking her for the compliment fueled her. Sadly, all of us at the complex avoided her."
People who breakup with their SO and end up going right back despite all the problems in their relationship.
"This is so ridiculous. Just had a bachelor party for one of my buddies and we went through this ridiculous process of figuring out how to make sure his future wife didn't find out we were hitting the strip club because she tracks his location on Snapchat. Mind you, this was at 2am right after bar close but he insisted that she might have set an alarm to check at this time.  # The fact that she cares about going to a strip club for a bachelor party in the first place is bizarre to me because I trust my partner and vice versa, but to set an alarm at 2am to check his location? My god, are you sure you two should be getting married?"

"Expensive watches, cologne, ""sneakerhead"" shoes, posh cars, being/attempting to be an IG influencer, comically-loud and/or large personal vehicles, edgy bumper stickers, dressing/talking like a cowboy, being a DJ, being rude to service industry workers, boasting about how much money they make/made.

It's my fault for not looking harder for a later date.

"Yeah that's the point of a reply, to add more information. The difference is that I'm adding information to my own argument, while you are adding (inaccurate) information to mine.  Even if what you claim is true - though I would say that teenage guys are less likely to be quite as petty as girls of the same age - that means that each gender treats their own negatively. Why would people not want to naturally be friends with the opposite gender if they were basically bullied out of their own?"

You're allowed to feel good. Youre aloud to be proud of yourself.   3) its a new social experience, its normal to want to talk about it.     Just dont let it become a habit.

I never wanted to change a nappy, and now I have to do it multiple times a day, 6 years running, with no end in sight, and usually it includes cleaning her pants, and sometimes cleaning the floor and furniture it also leaked through onto.  Sometimes the fact she's happy is more annoying because I want to be angry with her about it, but she doesn't fucking let me because she's too fucking cute.  Also now she's bigger she can get into more trouble. I prefer fewer successes in her development, because until she learns to eat by herself and get toilet trained, the developments are usually used for evil."

I feel like awareness is genuinely needed, particularly since one of mine is probably highly underdiagnosed and I feel like nobody knows shit about treating it (depersonalization disorder).   I definitely seek reassurance a lot, which is kind of similar to but not quite the same as attention? Idk I don’t want to say that it’s ok that I do this, but it is a genuine symptom of my OCD. Just saying that feels like an excuse even though it is true. I know it’s my responsibility to deal with it though.

"That's completely understandable. Its too bad that the manager chooses favorites based off anything besides the generated results though. Its also very likely that they're trying to keep you down because they know you have potential of replacing them.    We have a sales manager like that and she deliberately acts bitter to employees who land big accounts/sales because she's jealous it wasn't her. Its a very sad thing to see and ultimately, the company pays the price.   As someone who always tries to do my job with all I got, it makes me happy that you try to perfect your job as well. Unfortunately, a good portion of hires wont go above and beyond because they don't take pride in their work. I hope you can get a better manager one day or better yet, take their position!"

I always own my own mistakes (sometimes too eagerly), but I never hold others accountable; especially those who are at my level. Today I was overzealous about a special project and let the regular work slide. The other two managers on duty let it slide as well.  Our GM came down on us for letting it go (rightfully so). After she left the other two started to talk about “I don’t get talked to that way” and “I can’t believe she...”  They turned to me expecting me to chime in and agree. I most certainly did not, but 10 years ago I would have half-heartedly gone alone with it. Five years ago I would have just smiled and shook my head and walked away. Today I owned it for all of us. I told them she was right and that we should have been on top of the work.  Honestly, they seemed surprised. I feel so good about myself!"

I think it is a sign of your insecurity but you can overcome it if you actually believe what yoir friends/other people say when they counter you with a compliment. I used to do this and got to the point that i thought they were simply brushing my comment off and it made me even more insecure and feel bad about the person i thought i was. Great changes to come if you get over that bad habit.

"To all of you on this thread. Ditto. A few years ago tho, I worked with someone who did it too, A LOT. And I fucking hates it. It made me realize how self-centered I sounded though when I did it. Every time I made a mistake, I made it about me, not the task, not the inconvenienced party, not the solution, it was about lil old incompetent ME. And if the audience was nice, it elicited a kind response. Now I’ve messed up, AND made them comfort me (not my intent, but it was often the result). What a POS, right? &lt;—irony.  So now I follow the SBAR (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation) model for screw ups:   S: I dropped the ball, here’s what needs fixed. B: here’s how the ball got dropped (If relevant) A: this could result in the ball hitting the floor R: if you catch the ball I dropped the situation will be averted and I’ll take cuz measures to make sure it doesn’t occur again.  Of course I apologize, but I try to focus on the solution at hand, and the solution for the future. I font know if people like working with me more, but I like working with me more. And I get more shit done without feeling like a piece of shit as often.  My R: find a useful script, stick to it, be direct, honest but not self-effacing. It’s an incremental step toward being better at shit and feeling better about yourself."

I've always lived in a household that does not recognize my anxiety, so they have no problem throwing me into a social situation that will give me a panic attack.

"I’ve always been very insecure about myself/horrible at taking compliments. I was dating this girl for just under a year, and when we broke up one of the things she brought up was how it seemed like I was jealous of her other guy friends, or protective over her (such as putting my arm around her, or kissing her forehead). I trusted her not to cheat on me, and as far as I know she didn’t, but there was always that self doubt that I wasn’t enough, and far enough away from being enough that she would leave me for one of them. Around 2 months after we broke up she said she wanted to talk about something, and I said sure, so she comes to me and just starts yelling at me. Some of it was called for, but a majority was not, and she made my self esteem/insecurities even worse. My self esteem is something I brought up to her several times and it was still one of the first things she went after during that talk. It’s been almost 6 months now and I’m still heavily dealing with it. Since that last “conversation” I blocked her on everything and am content never seeing or speaking to her again. So, if your S/O or best friend gets jealous or protective over you, there’s probably a reason."

"Great point. Furthermore, I believe the intent matters. If one is chasing a solution, the intent is clean. Solutions often require direct and sometimes difficult dialogue. Many intend to be mean, but hide behind the smokescreen of ""telling it like it is"" which they present as a sign of strength. Then they feel a need to live up to the reputation of ""telling it like it is"" even to their own peril and will cut off their nose to spite their face if necessary.   I've often been admired for ""speaking my mind"", but every time someone commends me for it I'm quick to remind them that I also know when to and just as importantly how to be quiet and held my tongue on many occasions.   Too much of anything is bad for you including honesty, directness, money, and even love. All things in moderation. It is an art; one must know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, and know when to run."

Also with the assumption that I'm dumber than everyone, what I've done is I've learnt new skills and studied in depth specific topics. For me they were Guitar, hate speech laws and currently personality psychology. Talking about them has given me the self confidence to come to a good middle ground.

The people who often say ""im not racist"" almost every time follow up with a ""but.."" or complain about asians 2 sentences later.   This goes on and on. Just be aware of it in your daily life and it becomes some sort of super power in terms of knowing people. Its almost scary.    Ps: of course thats not the case every time.

But if I'm being honest I never focused only on my insecurity, it was just part of the ""self-improvement pack"", and since I got actually good looking when I got older it was kind of easier to me to convince myself I'm not that bad.

"Yeah that might be true, but consider this.  Google might be collecting all your data but IMHO they are better at safeguarding your data from others. Look at all the security programs they have. Like Project Zero, which was started to find zero-day exploits in huge software projects (Most of them not even Google's). And their bug bounty program is really generous for people who find bugs in their software. We're talking thousands of dollars for a single bug. And their projects like ASan have found and helped to polish out several security holes not only in Chrome and Chromium, but also in Safari, Microsoft Windows, and even the Linux kernel.  Simply put, they might be collecting your data, but from a security perspective their product seems more reliable."

I’m 32 now, and I still can’t do it for more than a couple seconds with anyone except the absolute closest to me. And even then I rarely can do it. I hate that people think I’m being a jerk or not listening to them, but it’s so far from the truth. I articulate myself much better when I look at something inanimate instead of the persons eyes.  I also listen better because if I look at them I just think about their face and the features I may have never noticed before, and not what they are actually saying. It’s a weird thing. Because I rarely do it comes out when I’m angry. Otherwise, anything over 2 seconds and I’m out."

"What do you like doing? If you like doing something and you get knowledgeable about it by proxy you're now almost automatically interesting to talk to if the other person is into that thing. So if you have some activity friends you need have no fear of being uninteresting.  Also you don't have to participate in every topic equally. For example 2 of my close friends are conventionally more successful than me, so there are times when we're out and they're discussing saving plans for houses, mortgages e.t.c. I just take a backseat and actively listen or zone out for a bit."
Screaming “I’M VERY INSECURE!!!”
"And usually means you're gay. I had a friend who constantly talked about having sex with his girlfriend, how he'd just start having sex with her in the morning while she was still asleep, how they'd fuck all the time, and all the girls he had fucked over the years. Then his girlfriend kept finding gay porn in their DVD player. Once they finally broke up he came out, to no one's surprise, as we all already knew for years.    But when you need to constantly brag about having sex, and talk about it all the time, it gets to the point where it seems like they're trying to convince themselves more than anyone else."

Wow, look, a giant statue with you for scale. Aw, a puppy, and there you are holding it six times! Etc.  I'm not talking about being in some of the photos. I'm talking about *every fucking picture you share* having you in it, even when the photo would be better if it were of just the thing, person, or event itself."

"I went to a Small Liberal Arts College™ that produced a lot of grad students, including many in disciplines like Literature or Philosophy where pretty much the only job for a PhD. is teaching.

This was in the U.S. around the turn of the (most recent) century."

"Screaming, “I’m very insecure!”"
"Yes. that is insecurity, but you do it to ""get ahead of the game."" This is annoying to others , because it is obvious if you do it all the time. I am a University student. In a difficult math class I'm taking called cognitive reasoning ( stats on steroids), I have a class-mate that constantly says things like ""I'm so stupid, I'm not very smart, etc,"" then we all tell her it isn't true. The funny thing is after 2 weeks, we all realized it's obvious she is mathematically smarter than most in the class, witty, and thoughtful. I banned her from making comments like this about herself and now we boo if she does, or admonish her for it lightly. It's working. Self-awareness is the key to self-control."

":( What’s wrong with owning a gun? My girlfriend and I lived in a shitty neighborhood, I was away at work most the day, and she didn’t feel safe alone (she was a college student). So I bought a gun. Just the one. Didn’t really see a reason for me to sell it even after we moved so I still have it.  That makes me insecure?"
"It depends on what you think. If you dont think it is true and need to say it so you can hear others tell you it isn't, then yes that is insecure. However, if you know it's not true but say it so that you can constantly hear others reaffirm that it isn't true, then that is just narcissism or ego."

"I believe that's called Fishing for Compliments, and yes, that type of act stems from insecurity."
"This. People like this can’t even take a compliment.  I’ve seen newcomers say something like, “your artwork is wonderful and cute and these should be stickers!”  And instead of being gracious and saying something like, “thank you! Maybe I should market these as printable stickers for the planner I’m selling!”, the person they complimented says, “these are not for commercial use. I’ve updated my FAQ with terms of use [inserts URL full of intimidating legalese].”  Mind you the newbie had zero intention of using that file for commercial use (I know them and know for a fact they’re not that kind of person—not greedy/stupid enough to do something like that).  The newbie had 66 followers on their art Instagram, the person complimented is a Big Namer with 12K followers.  If the Newbie stole it, all the Big Namer had to do was say something about it to her followers and her 12K army of fans would have cancelled the Newbie’s career.  The Newbie herself was just fangirling her work (even after purchasing twice for US$90-worth of products from the Big Namer during which the Big Namer screwed her over both times she made a purchase).  So OTT &amp; unnecessary.  People who are genuinely good at what they do don't behave that way.  They don’t see everything as a threat."

"The paradox is, I would let my wife read everything on my phone and computer if she wanted to. I added her fingerprint to my phone in case she needed to get into it. But she doesn't feel like she needs to, so it's never an issue. Goes both ways; I have access to her phone too. But I only ever use it if I need to look something up online and my phone isn't handy. Usually IMDB to see who some actor is."

"For me, it took the better part of 10 years to find a doctor who would listen to me and the confidence/vocabulary to explain why my symptoms did not feel like ""just"" anxiety. I have slightly weird presentation which was throwing them off but the second they referred me to someone who specialises in trauma it was pretty obvious so... yeah, if people ask why I am so far behind my peers, I'm fairly blunt. It should not have taken this long and I'm hoping I can help the penny drop for other people who might be in a similar boat."
"I gained a bit of weight this past year. Every time I meet up with someone I have not seen for awhile, I feel like I need to announce I am aware I gained weight.  I usually just have an internal meltdown about it but sometimes reference that I stopped running “if you can’t tell” and gesture at my body.   Best part is, I do not know about you but it makes me feel worse."

"Sometimes maybe but I also think it can come from a place of confidence. No one can shame you for something you are or have done if you completely own it. Make it yours. Even if you would wish it away if you could.  I’ve had some mental health struggles in the past and I knew my (now) ex-husband would use it against me as we fought over custody. I was so afraid that I tolerated unacceptable treatment for years rather than leave knowing he could use it against me.  When I finally left I dealt with it head on, brought it up first, told everyone who might give a shit what had happened and how things had changed since.   To this day he tries to control me with vague threats and references to my mental health issues. It doesn’t work, because I got in front of it.  I outted myself so that he couldn’t - and that won’t ever change. That feels like strength, not insecurity. At least for me."

Or check that she’s got off the plane and is collecting luggage without having to text me while running around the terminal (I might not even know her flight number to check). That kind of stuff.

The question is “who” not what.   And anyone who screams “I’m very insecure” is the answer.
"It's called Basking in Reflected Glory. We all do it to some extent or another (*our* team won the big game, wearing a jersey of your favorite team after they win, bragging about what your grandfather did in WW2 etc.) but it is something we should probably keep in check."
People who post positive memes or memes that out themselves down on social media.
Stands for “men going their own way”. Sort of like a males alternative to a feminist group(idk how to word it).
"I had the eye contact problem as well, from a combo of shyness, insecurity, and social anxiety. And for me it was a self-perpetuating cycle - make eye contact,  feel awkward, shift eyes around trying to look normal and confident, get embarrassed and turn red which draws attention to the whole thing, and now it's a bad experience that makes me more self-conscious in the next one.  I managed to mostly overcome it (in spite of the anxiety) by just straight up practicing. Force yourself to do it a little more each time. For me it helped if I picked one eye to focus on. Eventually it'll stop being so uncomfortable, and you'll feel more confident simply because you can do it."

"Some people are pressured into smoking and make a habit out of it or start using it for stress relief. It's not always because of the need to look cool, it's a way to lessen anxiety. Tattoos are mostly to look cool but also sometimes used to honor someone or something. Sometimes it's a way of showing who you are to other people without having to talk to them because talking to people can be hard. Don't just assume things due to the ways of the majority, and don't just bundle everyone into one group. It's ignorant and misinformed."

Personally I'm very insecure and I feel like a huge sign of that is not being able to take a compliment.
"A big, jacked up truck that you brag to everyone about. They also try to best other truck drivers with the superiority of the towing capacity of their vehicle and will argue anyone who says theirs is better."
I attribute to malice everything that could be adequately explained by anything else.
"No way. You don’t degrade yourself. You’re just being honest about your weaknesses and working to make it better. And it’s not even a self-roast, really. It’s more of a warming, loving sort of self-reflection. And you don’t really want to hear other people deny it. You just listen more than others. You’re sensitive. Ok so do you feel better now that I’ve denied it?"

Interestingly, the person who I perceived to be the smartest in my program was one of the minority of students who had to retake my program's comprehensive exam."
Dying your hair.
"This is my biggest problem. I am trying to learn to make more eye contact, but am always too conscious that I am making TOO much eye contact, so I end up being in my head so much on how much eye contact I should be making that I end up not focusing on the conversation. And when I don't focus on the conversation, i mess up the conversation (by having no idea what that person just said) and feel bad about it and end up not making any more eye contact lol.  but your question on why it makes me uncomfortable? honestly it is a good question, i have absolutely no idea. i can just describe the feeling but I cannot explain why. I feel like when they look into my eyes, i get very anxious, like they can read my true emotions and feelings and read the inner thoughts that might not match what I am saying. so i need to break eye contact? idk maybe someone who has the same problem can explain it better."

"I have a somewhat similar issue. It's not that I have a direct problem with looking someone in the eyes, but I do rather look at other things. And I can better concentrate on the conversation if I am not distracting myself by actively trying to make eye contact. So when talking with random people I make eye contact, but when talking with friends I prefer to actually follow the conversation instead of just pretending like I do."

The worst is the disingenuously candid pictures where they're feeling the living hell out of themselves and still try to pretend it was candid and that they always look like that.  Not that they don't still look like 7/10's, the fake candids are just too funny."

Posting on social media about how happy you are and how awesome your life is.
"Oh, that could make sense."
These apps need a feature that tells you who checked up on you.  The Norway model.  You can check your neighbor's tax returns but in turn he knows that you checked up on him.
Why do you think you’re a waste of human life?
Friend made a vegan joke. I laughed. A vegan (friend of the one who made the joke) messaged me insulting me on why I laughed. On how im an animal killer. Getting angry on why I have health reasons that would literally prevent me on being a vegan.

“My cat’s blacker than your cat”.
"I used drug abuse to cover my insecurities. If it'd make me feel happy, I'd take it.  Helped me talk to people and breach out of my shell, too.  But then I started to puke blood in the mornings, and I began the process of finding new coping mechanisms."
"&gt; Bitch, yes you do want to talk about it  I'm totally going to use this line the next time one of my friends is acting like a princess"
"When people decide to race on city streets, flooring it when the stoplight goes green then screeching to a halt at the next red.  Seriously, dude, that really doesn't impress people. It just shows your insecurity and desire to be a special little snowflake."
"Constant social media ""posing"" posts; especially some, you know which ones I'm talking about."
And realising that almost every top comment checks out.

"People like that are addicted to conflict too.  Anyway, I always thought they posted those types of quotes because they thought highly of themselves—like everyone’s “jealous and out to get me.”  Never crossed my mind they’d be masking insecurities."
That is actually a legit negotiation tactic called accusation audit.
Always posting about your significant other on social media. Like nothing but photos of them with cheesy paragraphs.
"I get it you still have a primitive mind set and that’s ok, but you don’t need to be a dick just because I enjoy having blue hair."
yup. my partner at work is this guy.
The girl in my old friend group who got complimented and hit on the most would do this. She’d get drunk and start complaining about how she wasn’t pretty or would randomly ask people if she was beautiful. The worse was when the people she was talking to would turned to me (a person with low self esteem and confidence who never gets hit on) and go “isn’t she beautiful? Tell her how beautiful she is” it made my insecurities worse
God I am so this.
"I think if everyone actually thought about it, they'd realize that they've been this person before. I really don't give a shit if a person speeds as long as they aren't swerving around or cutting it too close to other cars."
I have a really bad paranoia problem. I think people are out to get me or avoid me or secretly hate me/want to hurt me/conspire against me. I know it’s not true but the voice in the back of my head says it is
"If you're fishing for someone to interject and disagree, you're insecure.  If you don't care whether they agree or not. You have low self esteem.   Like someone else posted, if you think the latter, youre most likely a perfectionist and expect too much of yourself. The first is when you think you're the shit and want others to say it."

"1000% agree with your new approach.  I have a work friend who constantly puts himself down in this way and I hate it. Now, not only do I have to address the actual problem/situation, but I have to do the emotional heavy lifting of ALSO reassuring him that he's not a piece of shit. It's tiring and not productive. It's gotten to the point where I don't bother arguing back, I just let his statements hang in the air because I don't want to go through it again."
"Hey agatharcus, you're doing just fine, don't sweat it. People are too caught up in their own shit to pay nearly as much attention to your ""bad"" as you think."
I had to post a hospital selfie Tuesday but only because otherwise my mom would make it sound like I was dying.   I am not dying. I merely have some sort of Hell Infection in my intestines which requires horse pill antibiotics and boring food for a week.  0/10 do not recommend.
Feeling like you have to out-due everyone so you get praise.
Always trying to up someone’s story.
"I had a co-worker ""friend"" who was quite insecure and would passive aggressively compliment and insult me all in one sentence constantly. For instance, after I had been working out consistently for a few months, she said, ""girl, I guess I need to start working out like you do, or you are going to be prettier than me!"" The words that came out of her mouth were just plain awful. She told another co-worker who had recently lost a few pounds in the ""Sara, you must be just like me! you gain a bunch of weight in the winter but lose it in the summer."" Brutal. Sara said "" ummm, thanks I guess?"" Mind you this was a full grown adult woman. Snarky."
"Magic: The Gathering does it for me. I do not buy booster box, but I have spent TWICE the price of booster box last two months by buying singles and other older products.  Why? Because other people play better decks than me. They always beat me, and I got no or less rewards from tournament if I do not upgrade! So I continue to buy buy buy until I realise, wtf man, I spent these much already!"
Or you're either brainwashed or stupid.
"Lmao, come back with, ""Wow! That's huge! Maybe he has gigantism and will end up dying at thirty!"" Or another alternative, ""Lol, what a fatass kid"""

"My parents go to church almost every Sunday and my dad switched to pot gummies in very small doses from his prescription for his chronic pain from being old because it works a lot better. Sometimes both my parents will do the full dose with drinks together lol.

"It makes no difference whether Google has your data or some other company. Google itself will act nefariously, whether they share the data or not.

And Googles has a high interest in bugs being fixed simply to keep their own servers secure."
"More mental health problems than someone walking the street should, never finished school, never had a job and probably never will. Live at home, cant live without self medicating with weed.

"My dad used to use apps like these on me. It was really funny when he texted me in a lecture to make sure I really was at class, and not by a police station 3 hrs away from me. His phone was glitching really bad, and he was genuinely worried. He texted again saying he was on his way coming to check on me, which would have been really hilarious if he drove about 4 hours to come make sure I was okay. Stopped him about 5 minutes into his drive. It was a great laugh for my friends and I."
"Im not sure if I was being insecure, but from start to finish when my ex gf, myself, and her best friends, male, were together, also nothing going on with her and him, only white dick gets this pussy was her phrase.  But while we were trying to talk while we did whatever, play games, etc.  I would try to chime in, but I would be...forgotten, or talked over, or like what I said wasn't even heard, so I felt down as when they were together I  should basically have left the room or went and did something else.  I've thought, maybe my deep voice, they didn't hear me, so I'll raise my voice a bit, nothing.  I've also worked in haunted attractions for 5 years so I've learned to throw my voice, so I try to watch what's raising and yelling."
"Me and my wife track each other. Usually because if I need to call her, I can’t get through if she’s at work and I can’t answer the phone if I’m with a customer. We also use it for planning after work activities"
Posting a lot of selfies
"The key to being a straight shooter or being one who ""tells it like it is"" is knowing when the truth needs to be heard and when it doesn't."
"I grew up a very shy person who never initiated conversations or knew what to say back to people l hadn't warned up enough to. And now I think I overcompensate for that by talking TOO much, and it sucks. It's like my social anxiety either leads to me being too quiet or talking too much, with no in between (besides with people I know well)."

"There are a LOT of posts on here that are about bragging or one-upping, which surprises me.  Constant apologies.  If their first response to any minor inconvenience or difference of opinion or anything is, ""I'm sorry,"" it's because they are use to or expect to always be wrong or somehow less-than others.  Source: I used to constantly apologize.  I still slip into that habit if I start to feel uncomfortable.  I had several people I knew point it out to me and worked on it for a long time.  I hadn't even realized I was doing it at the time.  Now, when I see it in others, I recognize it and try to what was done for me: Tell them that they don't need to apologize for everything!  Only apologize if you've done something legitimately wrong, not for every part of your existence or interactions with others."
"Feel you, OP. My insecurity has been at an all time high as of late, and its difficult to tell stories or share personal experience. Feels like everyone else has something better/more interesting to say? Input from me feels (for a lack of better words) uncool?"

"&gt; No, mexico's asylum program is used heavily, with their crisis with the cartels they are, as I already stated, not equipped the way we are.  So have you actually ever been to Mexico?   &gt;What's plenty to you? Half a percent?  https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/768032924/african-migrants-stuck-in-mexico-plan-to-march-toward-u-s  &gt;You realize most of the asylum seekers are not from mexico right? Say 100% of Mexican immigration is single men of working age, what does that have to do with these asylum seekers? you know, seeing as how most of them are not from mexico.  Why does their age or gender matter at all?  &gt;cool, now you've got thousands upon thousands of asylum seekers stuck at the border of mexico who will likely die.  Cool. I didn't put them there.  &gt;Or be shipped to cartel areas by Mexican police and dumped to be taken into human trafficking or killed.  Again, have you ever actually been to Mexico?  &gt;what the hell do you think 'concentration camps' means, does 'internment camps' satisfy your fragile psyche? Also are you really gonna clutch pearls about my use of the correct terminology, when you just suggested we just let these people die?  No and yes.  &gt;all trumples are psychopaths  Good thing I'm not a Trump supporter, isn't it?  &gt;Because mexico is shipping them to dangerous areas, or simply throwing them back south of their own border.  &gt;No they're asylum seekers, and as such are afforded certain rights under the 1951 Refugee Convention Treaty.  Maybe because most of them don't meet the requirements to warrant asylum.  &gt;no, they participated in Destabilization of the entire region during the cold war. Which made the countries there ill equipped to deal with drought  And what exactly did the US government do in Honduras? We haven't had any conflicts with Honduras in over 90 years. If that's not enough time to get their shit together, then I don't know what to tell you.  &gt;Wait are you saying the people coming from Honduras are doing so because of a drought? wouldn't that make their claims valid? if, you know, they'd die of thirst otherwise?  Not how droughts work, sweetness. They're at risk of starving, not dying of thirst."
Well fuck. I’m insecure

"Stopping to think about, i think i dont have a activity friend. I usually talk to some school friends and some college friends who (almost all of them) doesnt share the same interests, besides my girlfriend that i spend most of my time with and its kinda difficult to me make new friends. Its like a cicle of feeling uninteresting to my friends, so i'm not interesting to anyone else.   About participating, i kinda know that, but for some reason i have this feeling of ""having to be there"" do you know? As if i wasnt there participating, i feel like i was missing something, or as if i wasnt making so much effort to get interested in what they're talking about."

"Context, to start off with, she broke up with me over text. Then we talked over the phone a couple weeks later and I was good with the break up. Then she wanted to talk in person, and blamed everything on herself, then couldn’t live with that and blamed it on me.  Point, she yelled at me for smoking cigars with my friends (I am and was of legal age) but was perfectly fine with leading me on until after prom when she basically dropped me, and officially broke up with me almost a month later."

"In my freshmen year of high school, this boy I had a crush on once told me, ""Can you, like, shut up? You talk way too much."" I beat myself up over it so much that I trained myself to speak as little as possible to avoid annoying people any longer.  In the beginning of my Junior year, I switched schools. I am a Senior now, and a majority of people genuinely believe I am some sort of mute, as I almost never speak when I am at school."
Me.
"Trying to please everybody.  I’ve always had a problem with this, I couldn’t bear the thought of being disliked by anyone so I acted differently in front of different people. My attitudes, opinions, and even the way I spoke changed drastically from person to person sometimes, and I often felt like I was living a double life or wearing a mask. Even though I could seemingly act confident, I was second-guessing myself all the time and was a total pushover.  At the end of the day, if someone doesn’t like you for who you are they shouldn’t be a part of your life. There’s no sense in being fake all the time just to maintain superficial relationships."
"No, no it should not. I'm transgender and while I would consider it rude if it was done on purpose, I would not consider it a hate crime whatsoever. If it was an accident, that's totally fine."
"Not a reality show, but that reminds me of the Competitive Mothers skits on Goodness Gracious Me. They're basically comedy skits of two Indian mothers who keep trying to one-up each other with increasingly more ridiculous stories about their sons until one finally cracks and says, ""Yes, but how big is his danda?"""
"YES. I know everyone does it from time to time, but when someone repeatedly tries to tell you who/what they are or how they're unique, I start to assume that they're actually NOT those things at all but are just trying really hard to be, or just really want to be. It basically gives the opposite impression that they're hoping.  I'm in my mid 30s and the people I know who still do this, remind me a lot of high school. I know I did that shit in high school and the beginning of college, like a lot of people, but then most people grow out of it when they start letting their lives and personalities and work speak for themselves."

One time, a couple of us did something he didn't like (asked him not to post his hiking trip on social media if he said he was too unwell to come to rehearsal), and he hasn't spoken to any of us since. We were supposed to leave on a tour of our play four days later, too. Worst."

Nearly died many times, and still wish i succeeded, I am very unlucky or lucky depending on how you look at it.

"Just wanna say that you're awesome for sharing this and I'm proud of you.  I'm hoping I can set my life straight again, since I derailed a little bit. Gonna work on treating people better, start eating healthier, get rid of some toxic habits and start working on myself.

Excuses only work as a way of ignoring shit. Time to actually face my problems."

I'm definitely this. I'm very jealous of my friends as they're all successful and I'm not. I definitely let it show sometimes and it's not a great look.  I know I should be happy for my friends and I'm glad they're well off but I'm just a jealous gremlin.

I'm really conflicted on this topic because some people definitely have crippling social anxiety but a lot more people don't, but use it as an excuse to not to do stuff and it eventually becomes an issue.  It's this very awkward catch 22 where we want to raise awareness about issues like this but then also avoid people becoming convinced that they have it or that they can use it as an excuse to shut down."
I was a little heart broken when I found out my boyfriend didn't celebrate anniversaries. By the third year I could see where he was coming from and stopped being hurt by it. For him personally he felt that celebrating anniversaries was reserved for marriage. I guess it worked out because we've been married over 2 years now.

Talking about how much money they make
"I want to comment on the assumption that avoiding eye contact means someone feels insecure. This is incorrect, at least as a reliable assumption in every case. A lack of eye contact simply means that, for any number of reasons, the avoider does not want to engage with you, either at that particular moment, or generally.  For example, some women commonly avoid eye contact as a means to control the development of social or business relationships with men who they prefer to keep at a distance (and of course, men use this method as well)."
:D
"Yes! There are various valid, effective therapies for different problems these days. What you did with your friend could very well be a tool of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) which is used to treat depression and anxiety amongs other things. Honestly, I would recommend CBT to any person who has human parents if they can afford the health insurance. I think everyone has some form of childhood trauma because their parents had some childhood trauma and children find ways to cope with that trauma that are counter-productive later on.   A big problem with depression and anxiety are the irrational thought patterns you develop, the ""little voice"" in your head that always tells you you're not good enough, that everyone hates you. Even extremely rational people in one domain can suffer from that. So one part of CBT is helping people question their irrational mental models. ""Why do you think that everyone hates you?"" etc. What you did with your friend is exactly what my therapist did with me. You did them a great service.    The other part of CBT is behavioral. I have severe social anxiety and so I had to go up to strangers on the train and introduce myself. I think that was even my idea but therapist coaxed/coached it out of me. The world didn't end when I did that and that was nice and also that I could do it was a powerful realization."

"That's hella creepy, report those dudes to the dean or something?"
It's so much worse for him and his kids to keep in that. Being a part-time father would only help.
"People who message you with this kind of thing:     What if your friend was gone tomorrow and you never   got to tell them how you feel?  I just want to say that you're  special to me and make a difference in my life. I look up to you   and cherish you.  Send this to all your friends, including me, no matter  how often we talk or how close we are.  If you get three back you're  a friend worth keeping.     OMG I H.A.T.E. this kind of thing"

"Mate, are you ok?"
"My best friend since day one of school up until our early twenties was ranting about how much of a psycho cunt his friends ex girlfriend was because she had borderline personality disorder.  He was saying how they're literally the worst cunts and are unable to feel anything and do nothing but try to ruin other people's lives. Basically a psychopathic sadist was what he was describing.  Little did he know I was diagnosed with it about a year earlier and I was in complete denial and honestly, as a male a bit ashamed. I lost it at the dude later that night after a few drinks.  Guy said 'you need to get the fuck over the dad thing mate, it happened 12 years ago now get over it. So and so's mother died from cancer and he doesn't complain as much as you'    I snapped and said 'you don't know what the f*** went on so shut the f*** up.'  In 5 years, 10 years, 50 years, your friends dead mother will still be dead and he will still know that.  I'm going to die not knowing, with so many unanswered questions, with so many wounds that won't heal overnight.   I apologized to this guy the next day, and he didn't accept it.  This guy hates me on a deep level, I've grown up beside him and all he's ever wanted to be honest is to be black and have some sortve adversity. It sounds nuts but I truly believe this guy's jealous of the adversity I've had to go through, because he's so ashamed of his perfect suburban religious upbringing with two involved parents.  What went on was this guy who called himself my father, beat the shit out of my mother, my two sisters and I, and himself and everything around him for the first 12 years of my life.  I pissed the bed and my pants every single day of those 12 years until he finally got caught for cheating by my child sister, and up and left never to be seen again.   There's stuff that went on that only I know, I drop subtle hints here and there and my mum acts like she had no idea.  I'm starting to reach my limit. I could go on all day but I won't.   Sorry to leave the tap running like that, I'm extremely frustrated with life at the moment and have no support so if you read this, thanks in advance."
Arrogance.
The need to always be insulting someone or gossiping about others.  Basically they can’t have a genuine conversation without putting someone else down.

That’s one of the things that happens with my autism. I can ruin friendships just like that doing that shit. I try to do my best to control it but sometimes it just slips and I can’t stop it.

Asking your self if your insecure
"Just got a snapchat of a friends wedding ring next to another girl's hand with a ring on it. Two second later I get a DM from her saying ""Guess which one cost more? 😍😍"" if that doesnt say it all I dont know what does."
Looking at people every 10 seconds to check if youre getting bad looks. (I do this way too often)
Orange man bad indeed.
Not accepting compliments because they don’t believe it’s true
"""weak, immature women bug me.🤷🏽‍♀️"" - honestly this still seems very insecure to me. Because you did not say:  ""I prefer friends I can just shoot the shit with, and weak, immature people bug me.""  You specifically painted it as a men vs women thing. I honestly had to read your examples a couple times to try to figure out what the ""distinct difference"" was because they read very similarly to me."
"Thanks. I will take that as a compliment. I used to be a much more stiff-necked, legalistic type, but as I've gotten older, I've learned/realized that it doesn't help *anyone* to be an ass to people about their choices. It's better to offer love &amp; compassion. People respond to that so much better than criticism and censure. It's almost silly how I didn't understand that in my teens/20s. {sigh}"
"Sometimes I wonder if people see me as a one upper for simply trying to join a conversation with a related topic.  Or if certain people are hyper sensitive (especially parents talking about their kids)  and just take every outside comment as being one upped when someone friendly was just trying to relate.  This right here is my insecurities.    I also recognize a difference between a story that seems unrealistic and made up compared to a braggy story or a pity story.  But for someone who sucks at small talk and is often quiet,  I get excited when I actually have something to contribute to the current conversation."
"Well no, I like when people laugh at my self-depreciation in good faith. But you're right some people will pretty much use it against you for their own benefit and it can suck... lots."
"thanks for your reply! but im somewhat in the same boat right now, about a year ago i started on the self improvement journey, working out, learning new skills, gaining new talents, etc. and recently people have been telling me im good looking/handsome? (maybe cause of my improved posture or something idk its weird).   I guess i hope over time ill end up like you where my eye contact problem just goes away naturally as i get more confident.  if you dont mind me asking what are the self-improvement packs you were talking about? id love to give anything a go if it helps"

"I was in a bar the other day. A gamer bar. A bar themed around Role Playing Games, Boardgames, Cosplay, console games, sci-fi, et-al. The bathrooms are themed like the god damned Tardis. It’s very clear what everyone is interested in.   On the night in question it was an after party of one of the biggest fandom conventions in the United States..  Cosplayers rocked the place.  In comes this girl butting into every small group conversation gong on and on about how she did shots with some Instagram star’s mother. After about 5 minutes the groups would disperse, and reform again without her. She did this 10 or 15 times..  then when she’d get some girl to pay her the slightest attention, she’d go on and on about how her boyfriend wouldn’t fuck her. (It’s a small outdoor patio, and loud obnoxious voices carry)  Later I saw her back at the bar with a friend and she.’s apologizing to him (maybe the boyfriend?) about wandering off but she’s “really popular in bars”...  Textbook insecure to me."

"Oh, well then lol maybe. She probably had a friend whose kid just yanked themselves upright and went for a stroll and has never gotten over it.   The kid who did that where I worked was this ADORABLY chubby little redheaded girl and she scooted on her butt instead of crawling, then one day popped up and toddled off like nothing! We were all like, ""AGH! CLAIRE! NO! Except good for you yaaaay!"" because parents got fucking *emotional* about missing baby milestones, but we also didn't want to make the kiddo upset.   Anyways paid parental leave needs to be a right in the US and so does a living wage and higher education standards."

"People who place value on externalities and believe that they are indicators of the value of a human being.    Celebrity worship, expensive cars, referencing their job, wealth, hot wife or name dropping. The list goes on.   These are all indicators of someone’s belief that the value of a human being can be assessed through their material or social class.  It is bullshit.  It is also ubiquitous.    People who do this tend to believe that their status, or value, it temporary, and that if they were to lose these things, they’d be worth less as a person.  I can’t think of anything more insecure than this belief."
False!
"Sometimes, seriously, close to that.  Some dudes will try and show off and act like they met some hot girls and had sex all weekend, and it'll be the first thing they tell you once it's close to reasonable to say.  Funny thing, used to have a roommate who DID actually bang chicks every fucking weekend. He wouldn't really brag about it, but act kinda sheepish and laugh if you watched the new girl walk off. He would be pretty smooth about it and just say where he met her, talk a little bit about where he partied or hung out, then wouldn't go into detail about anything. He didn't brag, he just did it.  Guys who fuck all the time are generally just smooth and know sex isn't too big a deal. If you make a big deal about sex, you probably aren't getting that much sex. It's just a fun activity, not too much to be proud about."

So you mean just like people who want a truck and likes the way it looks?
"Yeah, I get feeling like that person, I have a tendency to go into too much detail, for example if I’m explaining something from a show that someone hasn’t seen I tend to give them a summary of all the back story, I’m also one of those people who (probably) doesn’t really talk too much but if you get me talking about something I’m into I could go for days, but I don’t think I’ve ever gotten annoyed or known anyone who has if the conversation shifts away, I don’t understand that."

My wife and I do this. Lol. But shes an EMT and I drive all over for work. Ive been in relationships before though where they want that tracker app and it is indeed very unsettling
This makes me feel much better because I am definitely NOT an expert in the field I got a masters in lol. I know there is sooooo much more to learn in my subject.

"I’m guilty of this. Caught my bf seeing his friends when he was supposed to be at work. My only justification for implementing the location tracker is if he can lie to me or hide the fact that he went to meet his friends during working hours, what’s stopping him from seeing other girls?  I get that this is very unhealthy, but having the location thing puts my mind at ease. I don’t even check it constantly, but knowing it’s there just makes it better."

"When you keep posting memes about how much you work out and your ""fit fam"".  We get it, you're in the gym a lot."
"I used to be like this, and then I spent like two years cutting myself off from people, just listening to groups of people talk to eachother and realised that there's such thing as incompatible personalities.   Usually the 'I hate other girls' mentality comes from being bullied and ostracised by other girls.  By placing distance between themselves and other girls, it makes girls feel better about their own personality. It's also impacted by the media's representation of women and girls being gossipy/cliquey. By making young girls have a preconceived notion of women being gossipy, it makes them feel insecure about being a girl and being like the stereotypes. It creates an identity to place on other women that can help girls rationalise their situation and separate themselves from others, which others are doing to them."

"Now a more helpful answer lol. It is not the same to everyone so if it's now working for you don't panic, okay? You got it :)   Particularly, things that helped me were actually trying to just learn what I like and what I don't like and this kind of stuff, it may sound a bit dumb but I had a really hard time figuring out what makes me uncomfortable, so that's a great way to start, just try to observe yourself on your day to day life, if you notice something recurrent on your life that you don't like, try to get it out of your life in a CALM way, you can also try and learn to get used to it and accept it (I have had trouble with big changes my whole life, but this year I moved cities twice, got into college and stopped being best friends with my childhood best friend, so it was REALLY stressful for me. Learning to accept these changes was the biggest challenge, but again, everyone is at least a little different lol). This does apply to getting some space from people that don't add up in your life (I never really stand my ground and only pleased others, so I had a LOT of toxic relationships), I'm not telling you to ghost other people, but maybe don't dedicate so much time and energy towards them.    Other thing that helped was taking care of yourself, if school is stressing you, maybe take a break, go a weekend without seeing ppl from school or anything related, call that old friend and go out! Resting from this kind of stuff is not necessarily physical resting (I feel the more reenergized after weekends that are actually quite physically exhausting, where I feel like I really enjoyed my time) :). You can also maybe get new clothes or change your hairstyle, I know it's hard expressing yourself that way, but dressing and looking the way I liked really helped me. Maybe start gym, or if that's too much commitment (as it was for me) just start trying to exercise on your home once a week.    As I mentioned the gigantic changes in my routine, adjusting to it all was hard, so maybe, if you're not feeling good with your routine, you could add something you wanted to do, for example: want to get better at that game? Go for it man, you can do it. Maybe taking guitar lessons or starting to ride the bike around your city (if it's safe there), or anything like that. Just make sure it's a hobby not your whole life, and if it doesn't work out, at least you tried :)   And last, but not least, and I cannot emphasize this enough, don't worry about things not working the way you wanted them to, since no one knows what's going on (I spent the last 18 years of  my life thinking I was the only one left out of the knowledge of wtf is going on, just to now realize no one knows. I find this quite comforting if I'm being honest) don't worry too much about getting better, these kind of stuff takes some time and being too hard on yourself will only make it harder. I think that relating to some things Mac Miller sings in ""2009"" is another good way of understanding what I meant :D      Now just some commentary, I've always been shy and extremely unconfident and anxious, also kind of depressed for a some time these last years, but still I managed to enjoy them a lot, and I try to focus on that. I've never been diagnosed with any problems so maybe for me it was only ""a phase"", the correct thing to do is to seek someone specialized in this field, which I didn't do for personal reasons. Again this worked for me, but I'm really not sure how useful if can be to other ppl.     If you're going through some shit, just know that someday you'll look back and be happy everything happened the way it did. (I've always had a pretty detailed memory, so this next part doesn't apply to me) Sometimes you won't even remember what bothered you that time you were down or how it felt, so just try to power through it, but keep in mind that life's not a competition and everyone has their own time.    I really hope I helped you someway or another and good luck my guy/girl!"
"I don't think this is too uncommon. Someone feels the need to lie first, then triggers others to lie about it, or grossly exaggerate things they've done.   The US makes a huge deal about sex here and it's kinda taught you have to have sex to be a man and all that. Of course teens are going to lie, because they think it's expected that they should be doing that to be cool."
"You know as simple as that sounds, I’ve never thought of it like that. Thank you, you’ve opened my eyes a little. I know someone who is always being “blunt” as she calls it, but as soon as you criticize something she does (because she does a LOT of things that are mean and horrible) she gets super offended and turns everything into an argument.  She’s constantly insulting my mom in front of me, and when I try to stick up for her, she says something like “I’m just pointing out a fact.” Fact or no....shut up. Just shut up.   She then went on a rant about nothing and when I tried to end the conversation by saying “goodnight, I’m going to bed,” she said “no you’re not, you’re still here”   Like.....what."

"Okay...I hate to be this girl, but this is honestly a little of my life. I am SUPER pro feminist, and have a lot of female friends, but there is ALWAYS at least one female in the workplace/classroom/life circle who hates me for absolutely no reason. I will never understand it.  I am average AF. Average looks, intelligence, salary, material things. But for some weird reason, there's always just one female who hates me somewhere. It used to bother me but now I'm old and I honestly don't give one fuck if you like me or not. If we're in the workplace it will take me .000237 seconds to call you out on your shit.   If you are like this or deal with this in the workplace, fuck that. You don't have to like me but you better damn well respect me as a co-worker and as a human being."
I think all kinds of people can be insecure.
"I’ve been there, it sucks, especially if you said something that you know is sort of weird, like if you told a friend you stole a car or something and they didn’t seem to wave anymore when you see them and your not entirely sure if it was the thing you told them or if they just didn’t see you, or were in a rush, then remembering “no, we were talking after I told them so it’s probably not that” but then you wonder what else it could be or if it’s all in your head. That sucks, it’s the worst."
"Thank you so much, I absolutely agree with you, I also  wish the same for yourself."
&gt; but being shitty to him isn't going to help your friends situation.  That's rather kind and mature of you. You could say something crappy and you'd be justified but you didnt. I really needed to see your comment today (and periodically throughout life).
"I’ve seen a lot of the crazy micro-managing behaviour described above in a non-romantic context (at my local community theatre).  There was a local woman (usually an actress at our local community theatre) who crashed a rehearsal for a play she wasn’t cast in because she was out of town during the audition.  So she wanted to “control the situation”, I guess.  She was a “board member” which meant she had access to schedules (and unfortunately also had access to the promotional Instagram account). Basically many think that if she were in town she would’ve snatched the main female role.  But still, barging into a rehearsal like that is creepy also super insecure.  So she barges in during a rehearsal, catches everyone off-guard, and while they’re all thrown off by her sudden presence with a camera, she records people forgetting their lines just two weeks before opening night...  And then she posts all this video footage as a series of “promotional material” on the theatre group’s IG account to potential ticket buyers. (Placing footage of the role that should’ve gone to her at the very top of Instagram feed.)  Which of course reflects badly on the group she’s supposedly a “board member” for.  Also: There existed footage where the cast *were* visibly off-book looking all ✨professional✨ and shit, but I have yet to see these videos... They were mysteriously left unused. LMAO.  Because she considers herself a seasoned actress, she also gave every cast member some “feedback”, oh but WAIT! It wasn’t just *any* kind of feedback:  She gave everyone constructive criticism—except for the woman who got the main female role. So she starts excessively PRAISING the main female lead in contrast, possibly to screw her further (although in reality everyone from the director to the producer we’re very concerned with her performance and were trying to fix her—not praise her). It looked like she was trying to mislead the person who ended up with the royale.  Gotta love that level of insecurity (and cray).  When it was all over, the first thing she posts on the community theatre’s Instagram account is a selfie of herself at a board meeting as if to say, “look at the greatness you missed out on while I was away.” 😂  PS: I also think she only “helps” other cast members with their makeup so she can mess-up their makeup and make them look bad now LOL. I used to think, “OMG she’s so kind and humble to help us nobodies with our makeup!” 🤣 How naïve of me to think that!"
"Hah i knew it, i’m insecure"
No shit?  The point is that's probably where 52% comes from.
"After reading the top comments and realizing the truth that not only are we all, to a certain degree, struggle with insecurity between boosting ourselves up or putting ourselves down...the one way to overcome our insecurities is to internally own them through maintaining silent confidence.  It's very freeing and healthy to honestly express yourself, especially anonymously online where there are very limited consequences. The real challenge which yields the most benefits is to learn from people experiences and perceptions, good or bad, and to try and humble yourself which allows you to obtain that silent confidence. Maintaining it is simply a matter of practicing this daily until you find yourself appreciating and being appreciated by good, wholesome people.  With that said, I'm no social guru and I'm not trying to desperately climb a soap box. As someone who's been through a lot such as divorce, cancer, psychosis, and struggles like most people to overcome social anxiety to better myself while dealing with many insecurities, I've found that what I described in the aforementioned paragraphs acts as a personal and social shortcut that reaps the most benefits socially and mentally.  If you want to truly love yourself, don't resist being loveable."

"mmm being an insecure person myself I need constant validation of the people surrounding me, so I think when people start realizing this shit goes down.   also, lying to be more likable (about dislikes, likes, story times, etc) or wanting to be the only one who talks all the time (sometimes dragging other people down or making them feel bad), those are clear examples of insecurity. This shit is usually unintentional (at least for me) so you'll hurt people without wanting to :)"
"I can think of several behaviors other exhibit that scream ""insecure"" to me, but after further consideration I realized that responding to this post with those examples would be, speaking for myself here, a way of camouflaging my own insecurities. So instead I'll put myself out there &amp; respond from my own experience. One of the ways I exhibit insecurity is through an inability to accept compliments. I hate that I do that, but haven't worked through it yet. It's as if I don't feel I deserve the compliment/recognition/accolade or whatever it is. I hate that I do that, but still, I can't seem to stop."

Not really.
I'm afraid of trying to be better because if I fail it'll just show that I was right all along.
"Yeah it’s like my brain demands proof for all of my statements. Surveys especially because I want to answer each answer perfectly but say one question has two answers I like, then there are two possible results that could be affected depending on which I choose. I’m sorry you struggle with the same stuff I do but it’s reassuring that I’m not alone in my feelings and that a lot of people know the feeling."
"Oh, I get that, I’ve heard people talk about their symptoms with anxiety and I’ll occasionally notice some overlaps with myself, but I don’t go around saying I have anxiety because I haven’t been diagnosed, I’ve honestly never understood self diagnosing."
"Exactly, I decided to give up being friends with a girl after few years of knowing her bcz of this.  She couldn’t help but be competitive and dominated in conversations whenever there were guys she wanted to impress around us. She even rolled eyes when other people were trying to speak .."
I feel like if I never pick a side I can never be called out on being wrong.  The reality is that I end up wrong 100% of the time.

"&gt;Edit: I am from the Jersey Shore. While I think that should clarify    &gt;   &gt;some   &gt;   &gt; things, this is douchey behavior even for here.  I used to be from there.  It's more that the douches came down in the summer.  Of course, I lived in a nice enough neighborhood."

"Projecting. A lot of people do it, even I do sometimes.  It’s basically pointing out in other people/making rude comments, on what you’re insecure about. Not sure if it’s a good explanation.  I had a friend in high school who was insecure about her weight, and would constantly put me down about my weight. She eventually stopped and realized what she was doing, and we’re still very good friends.  I’m very insecure about my face/nose, so whenever I feel jealous seeing someone better looking or with a nicer nose, I compliment them instead. It helps me feel a little less insecure."
Asking this question.
Cars with neon paint jobs
"There's a concrete pouring company near me and the guy had truck nuts on it and a sticker with a saying that was pretty misogynistic. I don't understand in what universe that this guy considered this appropriate.   I don't need concrete pouring but if I do need some done, I won't hire that guy."

"A person who’s insecure, dun"
"With a motorcycle anyway, this is actually a safety feature. There is even a well-known motto about it: Loud Bikes Save Lives. Drivers psychologically don't notice motorcyclists very well, so anything a biker does to become more obvious reduces risk. So it's not really insecurity compensation. Now, how the bike (and rider) are dressed out, that can be.... :)"

Asking for advice on the internet is very insecure.
"Oh he’s an incel, I was wondering why he was getting so mad"

Talk about a fate worse than death.
"And how people confuse ""straightforward"" with ""honest"". Telling me your opinion with no regard to my feelings is straightforward. This has nothing to do with if I can believe and trust what you say about anything."
"Yeah, people get the wrong idea because of the show. We really aren't like that. Pretty standard suburbia around here. But there are a select few who fit the bill, sadly."
Hahaha I’m imagining this firearms scenario like a scene out of Hotrod
What do secure people do?
"This! My husband calls it 'three cats' - the best way he described it to me, when I first heard him say it, is when you're telling a story about how you have two cats and how much you love them etc. Then the 'three cats' person will have to tell a bigger and better story. 'I have three cats and two of them can do tricks and one talks french'     It's so fucking irritating. If you're one those people, please fucking stop. WE GET IT. YOU'RE FUCKING COOL/BETTER THAN EVERYONE.  &amp;#x200B;  Okay, I'm done &gt;.&lt;"
"He needs to get a divorce and they will both get 50/50 custody. You don’t hide money, that’s illegal and will fuck with him if he gets caught."

I think you just described me. I always just thought I hated everyone.
Why do you think I’m scrolling...
A self-aware narcissist.
"I know a person just like that. The more she tries, aka talks, the more distance she creates."
"Yeah, for example I know I definitely don't have social anxiety but sometimes, if I have been working alone on a project or something, I'll feel a bit awkward when someone invites me out to a social event because I've been solitary for a bit. I've had people tell me ""Oh that's social anxiety"" but it's not. It's just me feeling a bit awkward/not being totally down for the event or whatever. But I know so many people now that all say they have social anxiety and use it as an excuse to not go to events. It's fine to just not want to do something sometimes.  Actual social anxiety is a whole different ball game. You're not telling people you have it, hell you're almost certainly not answering the call or message to go to the event in the first place.   I guess it's similar to things like people saying ""I have OCD"" when they just like a tidy home etc."
"I have the worst time taking constructive criticism. I end up not hearing it and only hearing ""BAD! WRONG! FAILURE!"" and not actually growing or learning. I just take in the bad feeling and I hate it and want to reject it.  Many times I'll double-down on being wrong."
"Oof you sound like an incel  And you also apparently believe climate change is a hoax, your opinion is irreverent boomer"
"Seriously, my mom was cracking up when she first saw them. I remember I was like 12 or something and she was just laughing while we were on a road trip.  They're actually pretty fucking hilarious... not sure why reddit thinks it's just a bunch of hicks who have something to prove"

"Shit this pisses me off. One time I was watching a show with someone I know and there was a former actor who had clearly aged and gained a liitle weight. Her response was ""DAMN HE UGLY!"" like wtf is your problem. You're not married to him so why do his looks concern you in the slightest."

"I hate that I’ve developed this habit, there is a part of me that gets kind of pissed when a guy in a channel I like disagrees and I hate it so much, because I know it shouldn’t matter, but that part always brings it up in the back of my mind, I hate it vehemently but I don’t know where to begin in changing it, the best I’ve been able to do is kind of just think back at it like “no, stop that, they can have their own opinions, they don’t have to be like me”."

Where does this change from charisma to insecure?
Omg the introduction of quick reacts to messages has ~ s l a u g h t e r e d ~ the infinitesimal confidence I had  for message communications
I'm sorry. I just feel like I'm a failure and need to constantly be rescued but I'm too prideful to accept help because it shows that I really am as incompetent as I fear I am.
"I do this to make sure my wife actually got up for work since I leave a few hours before she even needs to be up. And then I do it when she has worked later than normal just to make sure she is ok. Which in this context might be a little insecure, but it’s a worry thing and not a “I don’t trust my wife” thing."
anything else?
At least you you have a vague sense of humour.
"I wasn't referring to one-upsmanship, though it seems a lot of people took it that way.  No matter, that also works as an answer to OP's question."
No you're not insecure.
"Tends to be broader than just conversations, in my experience, but conversations and social interactions are where this trait manifests itself most often.  If you’re doing something on your own, they need to inject themselves into the activity. If you’re presenting your work product, they need to find some way to tear it down in order to hold their own up.   It’s not just a mechanism for hiding their own insecurity, but also a very good indicator of someone who is well-practiced at being manipulative."
"Screaming ""I'M VERY INSECURE"""
Being a Democrat.
Calling other people names or starting anything excessively negative. People who write hate comments or talk shit instead of something constructive or useful to the topic basically screams hey I got major issues and I’m lashing out at y’all!
"I'm glad you're able to recognize their bad/unhealthy habit instead of taking it on yourself. My parents can be super judgemental and insensitive and I'm still working on getting out of that trained mindset. It's A LOT beter, though."
"Dang it, I made this same comment except you've done it 12 hours before I have. Now I look like an idiot.  Ugh."
Fair enough. I really only asked because the name brand and the fact that it posted twice. Thought maybe there was a glitch.
Constant bragging. And make up. And super prominent looking security cameras.

Is this some sort of a very deep question about human behaviour or do you literally want something that screams that ¶:
"I went with ""u mad bro?"" Because you originally and continually demonstrate a complete lack of reading comprehension skills, opting instead to be butthurt about a situation that doesn't exist. Let me break it down again.  1) OP said someone was flashing their brights at OP because someone *ahead of OP*, was going slow. Not only would this not do anything to resolve the issue with the guy going slow, it probably wouldn't even be noticed because *there's a fucking car between the flashing lights and the problem car*.   2) OP also did talk about slowing down to get back at him. My alternative solution involves making a dumb joke internally and affect no one. So my idea will likely result in overall safer driving because people aren't mad.   3) I did give an argument in addition to ""umadbro?"" See #2. Again, demonstrating reading isn't your strong suit."
"I do, and the best thing about it is that i don't need to die my hair like a fucking clown to have one either!"
"If you're talking a lot because people find you engaging and enjoy hearing you speak, that's charisma.  If you're talking a lot because you're doing your damnedest to wrestle the conversation around to topics you're more comfortable talking about, as opposed to letting it flow, that's insecure."
"How did you fix it? Reading through these comments I’m realizing I may be a terrible person and I want to fix it. I think I’ve sniffed out a few things, but where did you start?"
"what always screams ""insecure"", for me, is when people always have to have a posse instead of facing someone by their selves like a real man/woman would do. bunch of scared pussies if you ask me. another thing for example is seeing chicks that dump gallons and gallons of crap on their face like some circus clown and then rag on others about something stupid as one small pimple on someone else's face. then you got the people that always gotta brag about every single thing, like congrats. you can perform a basic human function. and thats only the top few."

"I want to counter-argue this point here, since most people I know who go to the gym do so exactly because they are vain. Vanity is a very strong motivator when you ask yourself if you should go to the gym today *too*.  Whether there is something wrong with being vain is another question, but you are pretty dumb if you think that vanity is not a huge driving factor in fitness.  While writing this I realized that I am retarded, because caring even the smallest amount about fashion is vanity, but whatever."

"This can backfire. A girl in high school used to do this and one time she put down her hair and we commiserated. However, she actual liked her hair that day and was fishing for compliments. If she had just been straight forward we would have been supportive."
"I'd just said some generic stuff in my other comment lol Of I'm being honest, the eye contact thing didn't go 100% away, and I think it never will since I grew up with it. It's just that now I'm starting to look more in the face of ppl who are talking to me and eventually even look them in the eyes without forcing me to. I also started being serious about the self improvement around a year ago lol (I had a Panic Attack and my first Anxiety Crisis in the same week, which was just days after I noticed I was actually depressed (since I was kind of good looking everyone thought it was impossible for me to get depressed so I had the same idea) it's crazy the coincidences that happen in this site right??  One thing I can tell you that I decided to start doing was just going for it, even if I really feel like I shouldn't. Someone called me to go somewhere that seems kind of nice but I don't really wanna go? I'll try to go anyway, and ignore the ""I shouldn't have left home"" thoughts, most of the times I end up having a great time and feeling more in control of my life. Or even  ""some girl is showing some advances and I'm too shy?"" Well I'll go for it, and ignore anything stupid that I say cuz I know she probably laughed and may even be more worried about the stuff she said than that bad pun I made. Hope I was of help man!"

"Ugh, that's me. Like, I need someone to be with me all the time so I don't feel weird. I mean, not like, into the bathroom. But, like, if I haven't been someplace before I need someone to walk me through everything.  This is generally why I don't go to restaurants I haven't been to before. I'm not sure how ordering goes and everyone in the establishment will look at me and think ""Look at that jackass, doesn't even know how to order here. What a dumbass."""

I knew someone who always FaceTimed her SO to confirm that he is where he’s at and who he’s with.   The SO once tried to throw her a surprise party at his house and it was difficult for him to hide all the people and decorations because she called him.   SO’s mom pretty told everyone there that she always does that for the reasons stated above.
"Sure ya don't, and you got blue hair just because you woke up one day and thought having a head that looks like smurfs had an orgy on your mop was really awesome. No cultural signaling or nothing! Its ALL YOU"
Doesn't it depend on the context? Like what if in conversation your deed fits the topic. And you're just stating it. Cuz there are those that rarely if ever bring it up unless relevant. And there are those that say it just to so everybody knows.

And?

"Man, I'm dealing with that shit right now. It doesn't help that she's practically best friends with my boss."
So everyone that disagrees with you is a nazi then.
Trying too hard on Instagram. The most insecure person I know is trying to become an influencer for the sake of getting more likes so that he can feel better about himself. It’s pretty sad and sickening
"When I feel insecure, I fidget! And, of course, there is the unpredictable, but always dreadful, eye twitch that occasionally kicks in...."

"Yes I have friends like this... they always say thing like “I’m fat,” and then look at me to deny it. But I’ve denied it a thousand times. So I try my best to respond well and just say, “You’re not fat. If you think you are then I can’t change your mind, but just know I have no reason to lie to you and I’m telling you you’re not.” I always wondered if this is too mean? Would u guys be offended??"

"Oh fuck I hate this behavior, the compliments bullshit...  ""You didn't tell me I'm pretty for a whole two weeks!""  First, IMO it devalues the hell out of it if you force me to say it, it makes it super fucking awkward and not just a nice and sweet thing to say, and it's just not something that comes up randomly or often. You shouldn't have to hear that all the time. Someone who is secure doesn't need to be told how attractive they are all the time.  And what I hate worst is it becomes *an argument*, about how I'm a shitty boyfriend because I don't compliment you much. Even though I'm super supportive and try to help you out and spend time with you, doesn't matter. I just ""don't care about you"" because I don't fill your pretty little head with compliments."

Acting shy around mostly people also having anxiety
"Sadly, I know two different people who are kind of like this. To be fair, the first one seems to have greatly matured, but she at least *used* to be the kind who would get a diagnosis and then just make that label be her entire personality. I understand from some degree of personal experience that those kinds of things are truly important to who you are, but when you start listing off your mental illnesses on all of your social media profiles like they're awards you've won, it starts seeming like a problem in itself.  The other is the kind whose entire life revolves around one-upping everyone with stories about how bad her life is. I remember one time I told a story about hurting my neck by raising my head up way too quickly and she instantly launched into this whole spiel about the time she supposedly got whiplash. You honestly could not mention any kind of injury around her without unlocking the story of how she once got injured in the same way, only worse.  Another time, while we were in high school, I invited her to a party where she gently (and very obviously intentionally) bumped her head into a wall, pretended to pass out, and then told everyone including her parents that she got a concussion. I'm pretty sure she did all of this just because she felt she wasn't getting enough attention at the party. Earlier she had wandered off to sulk in a far corner of my back yard, and I guess when that didn't get enough peoples' attention, it was time to start injuring herself. Very sound logic."

Also loves talking about how he used to throw 19 year olds out of a bar as a bouncer.  Everything about him screams insecurity to me."

Not letting your SO do things with friends of the opposite sex.   I despise people who do this.   The only reason someone would leave you for a friend is if you weren't good enough in some way.

Possessiveness of their SO
"Welcome!  Sorry I was being nosy! I was like that, had been around, and then started using it more and more.  Now, reddit is life."
"Telling someone who made different life choices about how selfish they are and how they'll change thier mind or how they'll  regret not making the same choice.   To me that just screams insecurity, people who are happy and secure with their lifestyle dont go around berating other people for choosing a different one."

"If you don't think your own husband should show you emotional vulnerability, then I feel sorry for him."
"People are complicated and may be this way for a number of reasons. In fact, I'd bet it's even more complex than we can imagine as (mostly) layman to psychology and pathology. I can say one thing for sure about persistent assholes, there is something wrong and it's related to emotional impulsivity. I guarantee there's a large number of people we simply write off as being extremely spiteful that actually suffer from a personality disorder."

"You realize it's so ""effortless"" because they have a remote chance of fucking you, right? With the females, you have to actually work for the relationships...because you don't have something they want. How sad for you that you are missing out on the wonderful experience of female friendship."
Ok? My point is that it's not the correct numbers.
"I have to do this with someone I know too. They apologize constantly, even aggressively. I no longer comfort them when they screw up, I focus only on the solution."
That's alright! I didn't think you were being nosy at all. I'm probably going to do the exact same thing!
I don't think that so much...
Women that bash other women. Especially if they are attractive.
"I've found the solution to this is just to not overthink things. And in the end, if they listened/gave positive feedback, great. If not, whatever. Catching yourself talking up a storm in your mind and then diffusing the clutter helps too."

"Lmao, you stupid fucks are hilarious. You're also the ones that eat jizz out of your wife's cooch because you're so lame. Ask me how I know this you fucking chud."
"You, your wife and this older sister need to talk this out DIRECTLY. Directly say to her, I’ve heard a lot of comparisons lately and it’s gotta stop. We do it too (so you’re not directly blaming her), but it makes us crazy and we ALL need to stop doing it. If you see us doing it, call us out on it and vice versa. It’s hard enough raising kids, playing “who’s winning” is not something I want to play."

&gt;Thinking people who have rainbow hair are insecure is grounds for being in the KKK  I am 100% convinced my comment about you giving IQ tests to bowel movements was spot on.
A person that posts about their SO every 5 seconds. Shit's extremely obvious.
"When someone is bothered or put off by very insignificant things as a projection of their insecurity.   Example that I saw in my ex-boyfriend: I wanted to watch this new show on Netflix and I was going to watch it alone because it’s a spooky show and he doesn’t like that but he insisted we watch it. Within 10 mins there is a sex scene between a couple high schoolers and I could tell he was so bothered. He kinda seemed annoyed by how the girl was acting during the whole thing (she was very into it), and seemed annoyed they were showing so much of the guy (he was a half naked cutie).  My ex was a virgin when I met him and this was wayyyyy after we had been intimate. He was always so insecure about his lack of experience and would often project that insecurity. I’m actually watching the show right now since we’re broken up because I didn’t want to put it on again after he made it so awkward and annoying."
"Yes. I have BPD, anxiety and depression. It sucks. But this doesn't make me a woman who who will hunt who reject me. I try to control, I'm Pro active. I'm analyse how I feel and why I feel it. I try to improve every step of the waty. And realyl, the only person I harmed was myself. Because I gave up relationships for fear of rejection."

"The word ""sure"" causes me anxiety like nothing else."
"I do this myself, but in my own personal defense, ive been flaked way to many times and it gets difficult to judge someones intent, especially when your worried its going to happen again.   I mean i dont get all ""Fuck them, they are shitty"" its more ""Oh great, what did i do, i knew that shit wasnt going to last anyway, im clearly annoying and worthless and no one wants to be around me"""
"I had a fiance for 5 years that was incredibly jealous, I was walking on eggshells the whole time. When we watched tv together she would accuse me of wanting to fuck every semi-attractive girl on the screen, both shows and commercials. At the time there were still ads for Wrigley's gum, and gawd forbid if the Doublemint twins showed up.  If we went out shopping, my eyes would be focused on the ground the whole time. I'd veer us away from Victoria's Secret.  I was a letter carrier for the last year of our relationship, and if I'd been delivering magazines with perfume sample cards they'd stink up the whole truck. When i got home there'd be a guaranteed 3 hour merry-go-round of screaming accusations, crying, and her hitting me.  Oh, and she was a Mary Kay hun too. I had to spend a fortune on her inventory that she didn't sell due to regular bouts with the ""vapors"" (unspecified feebleness).  Of course she was suffering from depression due to a pretty fucked-up past, but there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. She finally decided to bail back to Cali and I washed my hands of her."
ORANGE MAN BAD
"A group of nasty women and men who all choose to spend their time ganging up on one woman right when she makes a big mistake and could get herself into some serious trouble... not only do these people go out of their way to mess with her self-esteem by playing constant evil tricks on her, (like all talking to her and at her like she's some dumb 12-year old,) but they collude together to keep her ""fired"" over and over again for a period of over 4 years.... they cyber stalk her, threaten her life if she says anything about it, and continue to taunt her all over social media over and over again in an effort to keep things looking as though she has caused this to herself due to her mistake (when in fact that mistake has longggg been irrelevant as the job manipulation and constant harrassing remarks and ridicule is all chosen to be done by them.............) Clearly, by them choosing to spend their precious time continuing to try to ""keep her at the bottome"" they are revealing their true envy for her... as they all know deep down, that once the truth is finally revealed about HOW MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING HER BACK and HOW MUCH THEY TRIED TO SABATOGE HER LIFE AND EVEN HAVE HER KILLED... they will most certainly be found out to be the REAL CRIMINALS who have no place in corporate America."
I'm very insecure
Looking for reasons for others to “scream” insecure.
"I would feel smothered.  The interaction between me and my SO goes:  Me- I've got work until 5, I'll be home around 6, if that changes, I'll text you.  So-cool me too be safe see you tonight.  Then after work: Me- my friend invited me to dinner, I'll be home around 9.  So- have fun, be safe, and text me if you need a ride."
"My biggest life lesson: those who claim to be the most of anything (hardest working, most intelligent, nicest, have it the hardest, etc.) rarely truly have that attribute. They make such statements to compensate for their lack of that exact thing."
Whenever someone insults Greta Thunberg it just makes me wonder how insecure they really are.
"Agreed. I follow my husband, MIL, mom, grandma, 3 sisters and a sister-in-law. Not in a stalkerish way but I get together with most of them fairly often and it helps save all the “where are you” “have you left yet calls”. My MIL is out of state but she used to call all the time when we were at work so now she checks it before she calls. I love it! we All live very boring lives so there’s not a lot of excitement in it."
"Reddit's opinion/ experiences with large trucks baffle me. Maybe it's because my parents owned big ass trucks that doubled for their business so I very very often drove one for years before I got my own car or because I'm from Arizona but shitty drivers are shitty drivers and trucks as a whole aren't really seen as more shitty than others imo. People are always impressed with my parking skills and it's because I had to learn to park properly with a quad cab long bed Ram. Properly as in, just because you're a huge ass truck doesn't excuse shitty parking or taking up more than one space.  Edit: also learn to parallel park said truck on a regular basis and it won't intimidate you anymore. Or maybe it's just my friend group and husband who struggle with it."

"My guy, do you actually know the definition of toxic masculinity? It refers to the harmful ideal that society holds men to. My ex-GF was abusive because she was a piece of shit. Purely and unquestionably. But she got away with it because society expects me to be strong, and women to be ""emotional"", and that I cannot be abused. That part is the toxic masculinity and the part I was referring to. **It's not blaming men, it's blaming the ideal society tries to force men into**"

"Yes, also, some people might start because their parents smoke.  However, it is my opinion (not a study I have read), that *most*, like 80% of smokers, get into smoking because they are insecure about themselves and want to look cool. So they emulate movie stars and think that they will look like movie stars if *they* start smoking, which is impossible, they look ridiculous.  As far as tattoos go, as I said, 30 years ago, no one had tattoos, and we all managed to survive. Then, they started to increase in popularity, and everyone started jumping on the bandwagon to look cool, because of their insecurity. I even see people 50-years-old and up sporting brand new tattoos. Why? They didn't have them for their first 45 years of their life, and sure as FUCK would not have been tattooed in the 1970s or 1980s. They get them because everyone else is and they are insecure and want to be cool, too. But, insecurity is not limited to those over 50 years old. As you well know, it is rampant in any age group.  The whole post is about people who are insecure. Everyone is saying what their thoughts are. My thoughts on it are my thoughts. You don't like them, just piss off. I sure do bundle things into one group, and smokers and people with tattoos are the most insecure people that are in existence, in my book.  Insecure, insecure, insecure people."

"Yeah, but the US wasn't what was originally claimed or in question."
"I’ve got a manager who is comfortable making “friendly” jokes/roasts about others but instantly goes “oh dang man...what’s that supposed to mean”, genuinely offended whenever someone does it to him.  Very insecure man child I tell ya what."
I was on a mom group that we all had kids the same month. This was a group of 300+ moms. My biggest pet peeve was when someone would ask a question like “Anyone else have child with delayed speech? What are some things y’all are doing with your speech therapist?” And someone would reply with “well my kid is super advanced with speech and here are some of the things we do.” Or “I don’t have this problem but I googled it for you and this is what came up.” It’s ok to just scroll past a topic that doesn’t apply to you.
"There’s a big difference between, “oh yeah, I’ve been in a similar situation, I can totally relate.” Versus “let me tell you about my situation and the story/context that goes with it. “  One allows you to relate without even hinting at trying to one up, and the other puts you in a situation where you may very well be one upping someone intentionally or not."

"Oof. This hits home. You get really good at lying too, in ways that are almost impossible to prove/disprove. However it can bite you in the ass.   Once I lied to a Tinder hookup that the reason I was in town was to visit my brother.... actually my best friend who looks practically identical to me. I even spun a story about our sibling relationship etc.... well long story short I kind of started seeing him (was in town for a month) and then we kept up a connection.   I visit my friend a lot so things got more serious.... what was an innocuous lie told to a hookup turned into a big thing. I was stupid enough to keep the lie up instead of admitting to it early on. Basically when he found out he ended things because it was a big breach of trust... I don’t blame him. I regret it to this day because he was amazing and we had such chemistry across the board.   That was definitely a wake up call to knock it off with the lying. Hard habit to break out of, I still catch myself from doing it years later."

Here’s some tangential references to how much money I make and why that makes me very important. Here’s the volunteer activity I do that makes me sound like a good person. Here’s some references to some impressive people I’ve dated or matched with that make me appear desirable and hot. I won’t be vulnerable so that we can connect because I’m scared of being rejected. So back to tinder I go where I can be superficially wanted by people that want me for my body.   throw your phone away, everyone"

Your friend is going down a long road before he is fine."

People have always gotten tattoos, it just wasn't as crazy as they are now with sleeves and on their faces and such. Also, an opinion can't have a percentage behind it because statistics are subjective and an opinion is objective. That is my final argument, and I will just agree to disagree."

Or when someone asks for something we haven't carried in years but that they ""used to get here all the time"" I'll say something like ""Well we haven't had that since I started here about two years ago, so..."" stuff like that."

Lmao you're being downvoted for saying the truth. Amazing how a man being abused by a woman is somehow blamed not on the woman doing the abuse but on men and male culture in general. Thankfully one sane person here. You said it exactly - paraphrasing but this nails it  &gt; You're labeling negative behavior from women as toxic masculinity. Imagine telling a woman her abusive husband's behavior is women and female culture's fault.   Idk how people can be so brainwashed these days to spew crap like that without seeing the hypocrisy and logical fallacies all over the place.
"Omg she sounds like an asshole, how can people treat their children differently, I will never understand. I get that one might be more like you, or one might be easier to get along with but you love them the same"

"My guy, I 100% blame that piece of shit for what she did. What I was referring to as a result of toxic masculinity was the fact that no one called it out, despite the abuse being very public.  Toxic masculinity is not blaming men, or even referring to a perpetrator. Toxic masculinity is the damaging ideal that men are held up to in society. It's a catch all term that covers the idea that men are always abusers and never the abused."

And these are my two biggest struggles as an awkward, mid twenties, single guy whose having a seriously difficult time feeling like I have any meaningful connections with anybody.

"GTFO with your hypocrisy, imagine being so brainwashed to blame the victim and the victims gender. You'd never say it if it was the reverse. It's male culture at fault if a woman is abused by a man? And also mens fault if a man is abused by a woman? You're high or trolling. NO ONE is that daft mate. No one, not even you. What you're saying is equivalent to blaming women in general and female culture if a woman was being raped or abused by a man. Though in your crazy world I'm sure you'd argue otherwise."

"Talk people into believing that they are ""secure""."
Self deprecation is usually about as positive as it is negative. It’s definitely about the context but it’s more owning up to your insecurities over hiding them. It’s healthy to do so long as it’s not constant.
Humble bragging is the worst. Never speak about yourself in any fashion to another individual to protect their feelings. It has nothing to do with their negative views of themselves.

Me too. The boys would play and do stuff. A lot of times the girls talked and did activities like friendship bracelets. I wanted to play. I hung out every once in a while with the girls but as someone with ASD socializing was hard. I've gotten better and have both male and female friends.

"My wife had a friend when we were dating who constantly called her to complain about her boyfriend or her job or anything else. Thing is, she. We met up with her in person, the moral of all her stories  was how cool she was. One of them even ended with her talking smack to a professional wrestler, outside of a WWE event. Fortunately, she finally made some positive changes in her life and grew out of that habit."

I played softball in college with a guy who had outrageous lies like this. Said he hit a ball so far once he rounded the bases before it landed. We did the math (this was years ago so I don’t remember the exact numbers) but he would have had to hit it over a quarter mile AND ran Olympic sprinter world record speed around the bases. Another time he said he made it from exit 9 on the mass pike to exit 3 (approx 50 miles) in 7 minutes on a motorcycle.

"Hey man. I'm really sorry for what you've gone through, and what you continue to go through. You seem like a very strong person who's been dealt some shitty cards. I'm sure that ex friend of yours didn't know the real effect those kind of words can have on a person, and I highly doubt he would have said them if he did. It sounds like he has some struggles to work out on his own.  My only personal exposure to Borderline Personality is 1 ex roommate some years ago, and 1 recent ex girlfriend. The ex roommate threatened to murder me in my sleep. The ex girlfriend, after being awesome for 5 months, became abusive and vindictive and life destroying to a truly comedic level. You really wouldn't believe me if I elaborated. She was very unwell.. My point is, I try not to let these experiences bias me against people who are dealing with similar things, and if you are feeling ashamed for your diagnosis, look at these kind of people. I would reckon you don't sink to her level. There are shades of any tone, and you're more than just a diagnosis. It's not your fault, and it's not your definition.  You say that you have no support, and my heart goes out to you for that. If you need a buddy to talk to, dm me and I'll get you my discord. I'm also in a discord server that you might enjoy.

This is so common! I used to be that way too...until a wise friend told me to stop talking negatively about my friend. I said that I wouldn’t ever say anything about anybody and inquired about who she meant. “You!” Hit me hard because it was so unexpected.

"You're labeling the idea of men, and men as a model of strength, stability, and being able to provide for a family - which is essentially all a societys idea of male culture really is. Don't give me crap about fratboy ""culture"" that's just trash so call it trash. It's not ""toxic masculinity"" it's toxic fratboys. Toxic individuals.   With a woman abusing a man, no one in their right mind would blame ""toxic feminism"" even though you could EQUALLY make a case some aspects of feminism and femininity are as toxic as their male counterparts. Fratboys = basic bishes, etc. For every defective man, I can find you his female counterpart. Yet no one goes around blaming toxic femininity. Why is the opposite OK for you? Doesn't matter how many times you define toxic masculinity in clever little ways. It's bigoted, 100% idiotic, and hypocritical. That you don't see it as such is not this man's problem. Though maybe you'd like to label my replies as ""mansplaining"" another gendered and disgustingly offensive term."

We all drew him pictures and wrote letters (or at least DAD &lt;3) depending on age, and 'snuck them' into his suitcase before he left. He also wouldn't drink on business trips because he wanted to prove he was responsible etc, so we would buy him 'Daddy Beers' which were the BIG CANS. (Yes, two adorable children and their mom would stand in the 40oz aisle of the cold beer section and talk LOUDLY about what beer to get dad.

I got a kid size pair of cowboy boots when he had to stay in Dallas for two weeks supervising a server installation. We usually got Horrible Novelty Tee Shirts and candy.

I am saying that the ideal **society** holds men too is why no one else recognized what I experienced was abuse. The fact that society expects men to always be the abuser and never the abused, and on the flip side women always the abused never the abuser.  Women have had a lot of societal expectations lifted because of feminism, therefore most of the remaining ones are just the flip side of male ones. Fighting both improves us all"

And my new movement ""women are poison bitches"" is not about blaming women, you feel me my guy? It's blaming the idea around negative aspects of society's expectations of women!  Then find a new frikin phrase bro because toxic masculinity AINT working out for selling this idea. Make sense?  Not saying you are one but the argument sounds like a full on San Francisco liberal who hasn't been challenged on poor ideas much, so I respect you for replying at least, to someone outside of the echochamber."
Oh don't I feel attacked.
"When that voice in the back of your head says ""but what if they stop liking me"" - the answer back is ""well then at least I know who respects me and can handle different opinions and who can't, and I won't have to waste my life walking on the eggshells offending someone who can't handle it"".  The end goal of being honest is to find people that like you for you, and its SO MUCH BETTER than trying to fake a personality that everyone is OK with."

"Toxic masculinity does not refer to the individual person. It refers to the societal expectation placed on men. The female equivalent would be the idea that they are expected to be weak, the nurturer, etc.  But yes, the truth is these ideals don't fit. There are an equal number of shitty men and women. But society (I.e. people in general) often ignores physical and emotional abuse of men. Men lose custody more. I could go on. Toxic masculinity refers to all the standards that cause these effects"

"This is also true. Sometimes the jealousy insecurity is warranted (not saying it's healthy but in the case of someone having had an affair, it's understandable), other times it's just a SO projecting. When I lived with my ex I worked remote IT from home, and would do a lot of the house keeping. I would shower before she got home so I wouldn't smell like I had been sweating from vacuuming, doing dishes, etc. Well apparently even having wet hair from having a shower, but ESPECIALLY being IN the shower when she got home was a big no no. It clearly meant I was having an affair, OBVIOUSLY. Thankfully she had no interest in being on social media, but that didn't mean she wouldn't get pissy about me using Facebook regardless.

Idk what coolaid you're drinking but being expected to be strong, competent, a provider, reliable, honest, virtuous, and somewhat resilient to the pain and hardship of life is not toxic. Sorry to break it to you. I've NO idea what other societal expectations you're referring to but I assure you they aren't societal and they're most likely new age BS that apply to manchildren that have not learned or been taught how to be a respectful, civilized man."
Shitting on other things people do. YOUR MAKING IT TOO OBVIOUS.
How did you get that so spot on?
That just sounds like regular bragging.

"I suppose you're right in that it can pretty subjective. People also don't account for the -sometimes- multiple years a couple has been together before they got married.  Makes sense that people say ""married for 2,  together for 6"" etc.  I wish you guys a long and happy life together and happy ""anniversary of meeting each other"" :p"

"Any male with an issue against “feminine” behavior from another male such as hugging, caring about appearance, fawning over babies and puppies, going to a spa, shopping, cooking, and so on... literally any behavior considered to be feminine.  Anybody can do whatever they fuck they want, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone, and you shouldn’t have a problem with it.  If you do, IMO, you have serious insecurity issues.    If you have an issue with what someone else does with their life, you are either jealous or have your identity tied up in something someone or something sold you and are lost without it."

Totally thought I was the only one who did this!
Purposely studying science so when people ask me why I’m alone I can say it’s because I’m smart
"my parents always do this and now i do it. i hate it because when we get in verbal fights that tend to down grade me. like 2 days ago when my mom was proud of me for scoring higher than 86% of my classmates on a test, it somehow led to talking about my failing grades and how i shouldnt be in pre ap but they check in on me every 30 minutes when i ask them not to because im trying to do my homework and lose focus easily. this also leads to us sitting down and promising we’ll do better even though we never change. my dad will also openly tell other people about my personal stuff. like at church he told this guy i wasnt getting enough sleep and he told my team leader and now i think she cares about me too much just because i wasnt getting enough sleep for 2 days"
"Without pointing any one group out in particular, but constantly making fun of your own race to an annoying degree. I went to middle and high school with a guy who would do this all... the... time. He’d play it off as a joke but it was clear it came from a discomfort he had of being in his own skin. Feel really bad for the guy looking back.   We all need to and should laugh at ourselves from time to time, but at the end of the day own who you are. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that and people will have loads of respect for you if you take pride in yourself."
"Guard parts of the body unconsciously. Sometimes crossed arms are just comfy though. Over the stomach and hands on neck are super common. Then you have people who put their hands over their face or are constantly running their hands on their face.  Mechanical smiling and laughter, twitchy half grins, darting eyes, constant fondling of hands or an object.   Some of these things are just other aspects of different mental conditions especially ADD.    For me I think the consistent messing with my hair to make sure I’m covering certain aspects of my face is the thing I do that screams insecurity the loudest.   Extreme indifference to things signals insecurity also. Not wanting to offend anybody or accidentally be on the wrong side of an issue."
what place?
"oh fuck yes I 100% agree with this, unfortunately have had to deal with this, and not only this but they put on a completely different persona in front of people, then treat you the complete opposite when they aren’t being watched"
Asking if it's insecure is insecure
"It can definitely be frustrating to deal with people like that. I try to give them benefit of the doubt, because it might just be a (poor) attempt at active listening. I know that when I'm talking to someone about something they struggle with, I will often try to relate to them, to show I have (some) degree of understanding and that they're not alone. I think there's definitely a difference between that and hijacking a conversation to make it about you, but sometimes I worry that my attempts at sympathizing are seen like th- Wait Oh shit am I doing it now?? Um...   Best of luck ^I'm ^^leaving ^^^now ^^^^byeeee"

Asking people online what they think is insecure so you don’t do what ever they comment your self
"I have known two guys in my life who did the same exact thing, they made up obviously bullshit stories in order to one-up someone. A huge amount of absolutely crazy stories that no normally functioning person would even consider lying about. There has to be some kind of mental illness involved, an actual cognitive impairment and not just insecurity. Not only would it require a complete and total lack of self awareness and empathy, but the fact that these people actually think that their stories are believable enough to tell in the first place is troubling, and to actually think that the audience believes your story is insane. Both of those guys were fucking idiots. They were just plain stupid people, but they didn’t necessarily give off “this guy is legit mentally retarded” vibes."

"As a former insecure person, I find that telling people exactly how much you do or don't know of any topic is the best way to go.. for example: someone asks you if you've seen the last episode of XYZ show,  which you watch but not all the time and you're not caught up. So you say exactly that... and who cares if they don't like your answer, no one is perfect!     That way they make up their mind about you either way,  and let's be honest they were going to do that anyways... everyone judges everyone, so why not just be completely honest, it'll at least make you feel good about yourself.  And going forward, learn to not spend time on what others think... honestly,  it'll do you a world of good!!"

"I went to grad school to better myself, learn more. I still feel dumb. I feel like others have sometimes put me on a pedestal though. I downplay my education.  I think I am insecure, others think I'm confident. Surprise suprise, what ever I am doing that makes people think I'm confident is actually just b. S. Masking how insecure and inadequate I may actually feel.  But overall I'm not such a bad person. I have others in my life who will lift me up when I feel down, and I rmemeber to pikc myself up every now and then too. My mom loves(Ed) me, and raised em to be kind, and she thinks(thought) I was beautiful and I look like her and thought she was beautiful, so... at least I have that to remember, even if she's no longer in my life."

Thinking the only reason someone lifts weights/has a nice car/shoot guns/whatever is because they’re compensating for perceived shortcomings. Some people just like those things and automatically assuming that (unless they’re being overly attention-seeking) just makes you look insecure

"Ok that new definition makes sense. I don't agree it's a thing but at least we're on the same chapter, if not the same page. Give me an example of a harmful expectation society has of men. Give me just ONE. If you have more, by all means. But please, give me at least one actual example.   And answer me this - how does society benefit from emotionally stunted, toxic, abusive manchildren? Oh it...it doesn't? Then there's the answer - no society expects that of men. There are crappy kids learning from crappy parents who have no idea how to raise a virtuous citizen. Fine I agree 100. But please, we're really going to say society's expectations of men are ""harmful""?"

"I feel like people are trying to pop out 9lbs babies now! Lol. I'm 5""2 &amp; I was 110 lbs before I got pregnant and weighted 145 at 39 weeks which to me was insane! I got comments like,""you dont even look 9 months pregnant, you're very small."" When in my head I thought I looked like a swollen whale. One time my mom even lied and said I was 7 months when I was 9 which just made me feel so ashamed and she did it cause I kept getting these kind of comments. I had to confront her about it and tell her people shouldn't be saying things like that in the first place. Idk man, I never understood how people can just feel comfortable making such comments. I hardly got a congratulations, and to make matters worse i look 16 so people just made me feel like an irresponsible teenager. It was really stressful having to explain to people my weight,age, and where the father was cause no one believed me and just looked down on me. I was blessed with an amazing friend who I would always go to when these kind of things happened and she would always make me feel better.  Some people are just small and will have smaller babies, doesn't mean the baby wont grow up and be a smart healthy child. Its called an average for a reason so idk why these people feel like the best weight is 7lbs+. Idk why people are so competitive with stuff like this, every single pregnancy is so unique and every baby is different so idk why theres so much competition. Every parent needs to be proud of their child no matter what, pregnancy and parenthood is not easy and it's not fair to add unnecessary stress to parents. Mostly every kid ends up being at the same level eventually anyways.   That whole vaginal,c section, natural, medicated, breastfeeding, or formula is also just a bunch of other things people can shame you on as well! Whether you're having a c section or vaginal delivery I'm very happy we live in a day in age that labor is as safe as it can be for both mom and baby! I remember people being like,""c section is not natural and it only means the mom is not strong enough to have the baby."" Like what the hell?   Birth weight does not matter! Having a healthy baby is the only thing we should worry about and I truly hope no one feels insecure about their babies weight. I've heard of 28 week babies surviving and growing up to be healthy babies. No one knows what the mother has to go through in pregnancy so we need to stop these ridiculous toxic expectations.   Finally, Thank you to everyone who said congrats!"

"I take a lot of selfies because I like how much different I can look depending on angle, light. Expression, hair, etc. Just kind of a boredom thing.   The thing is that a normal camera phone already has a particular filter. So right out of the box there is a filter producing an image.  Granted the filter is closer to “real life” then a high contrast, colored Instagram filter - but it still isn’t anywhere near a real life visual.   Calling it sad and Fd up I don’t think is productive. I would say that it is a bit of a bad habit but someone wanting to appear gorgeous in a superficial, aesthetic dominated culture is just actually pretty normal and understandable.   Likes and follows are damn near currency and you ain’t getting those without  perfect selfies lol.   That was a bit of an exaggeration, but I mean reddit gets so many users because everyone gets hooked to the dopamine spikes of getting a lot of upvotes.   Having hundreds of  likes on a selfie post is like internet crack. It is social Capitol in a way."

Yeah but they’re the exception the not norm. I’m not knocking women but realistically there are jobs where I absolutely don’t want women doing it. If I’m dying in my house on fire I want a big strong mother fucker to pack me out and generally it’ll be a dude.
I know multiple people just like this. I will be seeing three of them for Thanksgiving. We would have tried to make our own Thanksgiving traditions a long time ago if one of them wasn't such a dang good cook.

"Of course it was upvoted more. The reply has the dual purpose of calling out misandrists, *along with* OP for deciding to just gloss over/ignore  misandrists, which go hand-in-hand with misogynists. Same category. But alas, after all, it’s 2019 and gender equality for *all* is entirely constituted by just men being nice to women, right?"
"Are those actually the ideals of men tho? I'm challenging that aspect of your claim. I don't think it's accurate. There is no one saying these are good things. There is no (hopefully..) one worshipping role models that exhibit these behaviors. Men are expected to be violent WHEN IT MATTERS. Defending your family, fighting a war (morality of war aside). No one expects men to be violent for the sake of violence. No one expects men to be violent towards those he must protect (family, society) from harm.   No one is saying men should have no emotions. Yes, we are told not to cry as much because males have a duty to serve, protect, and deal with harsh realities. But men are taught to love, to respect, to feel loss.   I can't help but notice you didn't really give me any concrete examples of toxic male expectations SOCIETY makes of men. I can only suspect it is  because you're starting to realize no such expectations actually exist.   Even looking at pedantic role models like spider Man - we see he protects people and feels the loss of his uncle deeply. Super man - loves his mother, loves the journalist woman, protects others. Need we go on, I mean - if there was even a single case of an expectation our culture had of men that was toxic, you'd be listing it every reply. And yet, noting but vague terminology and new age hip jargon that ultimately has no substance. Please."

"I’d recommend reading some stuff by Jocko Willink mainly Extreme Ownership, and Dichotomy of leadership also his podcast (Jocko Podcast) is awesome and would recommend listening to that too. Episodes 98, 155, 50 &amp; 76 would be what I recommend specifically to help in this area but all of his episodes are amazing! But just so you know most of the things he covers have a very dark subject matter so if that is something that could be very upsetting to you i’d research each episode before hand but I feel like the ones that I listed are pretty tame with the exception of the intros of each podcast and of episode 76 (It’s talking to a man who was a P.O.W during the Vietnam War)  Edit: Forgot about the dark subject matter covered in the intro of the podcasts"

"Ok. The idea that men are rapists in wait. I see this all the time in media, and women often hold the same idea. This is kind of a societal fact, perpetrated by both men and women. But I assume you have never raped someone, nor have I. Yet it is this idea that leads to male rape being ignored or even ridiculed, and women with obviously fake stories destroying men's lives. There are others I could list, like abuse, or that men are supposed to show no emotions and never falter, or that men are supposed to be ready to fight anyone.   Removing toxic masculinity does not mean that people will become emotionally stunted, toxic, or abusive. It should still be the expectation of everyone to be kind, polite, and a generally good person. We just don't need the expectations like listed above"

"First of all, emotional support animals are not trained to provide services. They are literally just there to comfort or calm people, and nine times out of ten they aren't even trained to handle being in groups of people like schools or stores. They are NOT service animals, nor do they have the same federal rights as service animals. Service animals have to be licensed and trained by a professional, not just their handler.  Second, I have formally diagnosed PTSD. I have been there. However, no one I know who has it goes around telling everyone, ""I have PTSD, so I need excused from PE, because the teacher was mean to me one time and that triggers me,"" or, ""I had an episode and set the drama department's set pieces on fire three weeks before the show as a result. Teehee, aren't I so mentally ill?"" That's... Yeah, that's mentally ill, but that's not post-traumatic stress disorder. That's the kind of behavior this girl exhibited, and that's the kind of behavior the school tolerated from her.  Third, yes, I knew and got help. As a teacher, there are support systems within the school that legally are to be used before going to the cops with any student. Teachers are mandatory reporters, yes, but who they report to is different. Most schools have trained counselors and nurses on staff who can make the initial report to the police, rather than the cops or CPS coming and dragging the kid off to be examined or questioned by strangers. That's what I did first. When they did nothing, I took it outside to help the girl I knew was being raped. She wore turtlenecks in August to cover up the bruises from where he held her down. She's in trouble."

"There is this girl from my home town that decided to tell the world that she tried to commit suicide once upon a time. She then got a tattoo about it. She used to post quotes and thoughts about her anxiety and depression.   A year or two later I get her as a follow suggestion on Instagram. So I checked out what she's been up to. I look at a photo and I'm surprised to see she's getting alot of likes an comments. (1000+) (hometown average is ~45) I check out her other pictures. The same thing... I know this might come off as jealousy.  But here is the kicker: They are mostly party,butt,model pose pictures. Pretty much sex appeal... For someone who is insecure about herself and her body she sure likes using it for praise.   I fear that when she will lose that attention that she will find herself back in a dark place. I wish her the best."

"Some people, like insecure guys on a date, view complaining as a “power move.” It makes them feel important if they get to bitch and whine about something to a captive person, like a service employee, and if that person apologizes they feel like they have “won.” Basically they get told what to do at work all day by their boss and feel emasculated so they take it out on other people in vulnerable positions, like a server just doing their job. That server is probably going to say “oh sorry about that, I’ll..” and not “fuck off.” It’s their one chance in life to boss someone around."

I was going to leave but then two people got in a fight and one of them hit their head so we had to call an ambulance and I had to file an accident report and had a meeting with HR to terminate the person who started it and it was a huge mess and I couldn’t get to my phone.  Or it could be something simple as, “I needed to figure out how to do something in excel and I couldn’t figure it out so I spent hours watching tutorials on YouTube and lost track of time.”  Either way **every** time she said she would be home by X time, it meant she wouldn’t be home until at least X+2 and I wouldn’t hear from her from 15 minutes before X until she got home.  We divorced due to fertility reasons but that kind of shit 5 days per week is really annoying."
"^ this.  Also sometimes they are just that freaking busy. People like to throw around the whole ""if it's important they'll find time"" bullshit, but sometimes there literally aren't enough hours in the day.  I have a couple friends who are trying to organize something on Tuesday and I'm struggling to move things around to accommodate that (I work 12 hour shifts in a city that is an hour to an hour and a half away (depending on traffic), and am already struggling to find time to do things like grocery shop, work out, etc. Since I have maybe an hour or so to unwind before I need to go to bed). It kinda blows when you literally can't fit something you want to do into your schedule.  It's easy to jump on the overthink everything train, but that person your talking to has just as complex a life as you do and it's entirely possible that they just aren't able to hang out for a while. I had to turn down just about every offer to hang out when I was studying for the bar exam, but I WAS NOT about to take that thing twice!"

"Apologizing and admitting you are wrong.   If you apologize or admit you are wrong it invites lesser people to prie you open and take away any and all credibility you have.   There are those that do wrong all the time. Murderers, rapists, democrats, pedophiles.   Then there are those that do no wrong. Republicans, President Trump, infants of Republicans.   There is no in between. Either you are a person that makes mistakes and does wrong, or you are not a democrat."
"I'm full well aware of when I'm one-upping, like an asshole, and when I'm just trying to relate.  There is no delusion in my mind about my flaws and strengths.  Maybe it's me, and my bullshit sounds the same as my actual empathy, but that doesn't seem right.  Communication is a two way street.  Also, one-upping in non emotional stories can often lead to the best exchanges, with a touch of humility and some truth.  It's not a black and white issue, and probably not worth as much negative focus as you're applying."

One time we all got back from Christmas break and met up for a meal to catch up, she hogged the entire conversation talking about her break for an hour, never bothered to ask us how our breaks were.   People just started to avoid her because she didn't seem to want to share her stage with anyone else but wanted us all to be her hostage audience.   Argh."

"The idea that men are ""rapists in wait"" is as you pointed out - a logical fallacy. Society does not expect men to be rapists. There is no cultural requirement or expectation for men to rape or force themselves on anyone. Aside from toxic frat culture and people who lose themselves in power and abuse it, there is no rape culture.   Your claim was - society expects certain behaviors from men, and some of those expectations are harmful, toxic. No one is expecting men to rape, that's ridiculous.   Male rape is ignored and I'll give you that, because society expects men to keep quiet about painful experiences and there is a stigma associated. That is true and harmful.   &gt; It should still be the expectation of everyone to be kind, polite, and a generally good person  I thought that WAS already the expectation of everyone in society already. This isn't new.   &gt; Ready to fight anyone   Not true. Men are expected to be ready to fight, yes. In defense of their culture and society. Not anyone Willy nilly. Just threats to society. A man should be able to fight and I'd argue that's a positive, look at Shaolin Monks who train to fight since age 6 as part of spiritualism, they always exercise restraint and meditation. They're ready and able to fight as a last resort."

This reminds me of that weird Al song on Mandatory Fun
"No one is explicitly stating that men are rapists in waiting or are violent and show no weakness. It's implicit. It's in how the media portrays leading men, and men who show weakness are the butt of jokes. How many times have you seen rape of men (especially in prison), played as a goddamn joke. Men are always the one's depicted as the abuser, the rapist, etc. There are many more sources of these ideals, and they (even if only subconsciously) do affect people's views.  I know plenty of people who do see men as violent, dangerous, and rapists in waiting. I personally have been victim to both the ""men can't be abused"" and ""men are just rapists in waiting"" shit."

"Alright. I had a best friend for a number of years and she and I were attached to the hip. I saw her and my one true friend whom I could confide with. However, she suffered from low self-esteem and I noticed some disturbing behaviors that sufficed once I found out.   1. Never congratulating you or anybody on anything successful and important.  2. Never complimenting   3. Always putting themselves down in comparison to everyone else. ”I'm so ugly compared to you”  4. Envy. Always wanting what others have.  5. Always talking about themselves to get validation.   5A. One up-ing to stand out even in inappropriate circumstances.  6. ALWAYS TALKING BEHIND THE BACKS OF OTHERS!!!   7. Making fun about other people based on how they look and behave.  Ultimately, if someone does not love themselves, how can they love others? The answer is they cannot. If they fail to see the good in themselves then obviously they are gonna do the same to others. It's very toxic. Belittling comes naturally to them and we must understand that these individuals need a lot of emotional healing. If you suffer from low self-esteem, please learn to love yourself and I guarantee you’ll see the world in a different light. Much more beautiful and positive. You’re not alone."

One of these lifted truck suburban dudes was tailgating him and trying to pass him in his little mazda one morning very early. My bro sped up, turned his car sideways so the dude would have had to stop or drive into it.  Dude stops, jumps out of his truck  my brother grabs him and smashes his face off the truck mirror literally until the mirror separated from the truck.  Put the dude in the hospital for quite some time. He then drove the dude's truck instead of his to work that morning because ""it looked fun""....lol yep my bro.

Not that you owe it to them to deal with it, but each person that can understand and accept them increases their chances of breaking out of that insecure attachment style (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults) and passing it on. A lot of the times the parents don't know any better because they themselves didn't have healthy relationships with their parents.  If you can find the heart to accept such people you will help the street dog inside them calm down a little bit."

"Hmm, touche I did not consider that. Took a while but yeah, I see it. You ain't wrong on that. As a general rule of thumb, men are the Boogeyman in our society. You could argue it's statistically backed up - most crimes and violence IS committed by men. But maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy combined with decades of bad upbringing and culturally reinforced stereotypes.   Though two points I'd make are - weak men are not a positive either, man or woman weakness is not something to be celebrated. And even though we want to be civilized we are still animals at heart, and will behave according to instinct and tribalism first and foremost. Sadly."

"Here’s what I do:  -	Someone tailgating me in the left lane? Flat out never happens. If someone comes up behind me while I’m in the left lane I put on my blinker and move over to the right lane, even if it means slowing down. I can just cut back in behind the tailgater. Not like either of us can go any faster. There’s someone in front of them. -	Someone tailgating me in the right lane while the left lane is full? I completely ignore them and don’t let it get to me.  -	Someone tailgating me in the right lane while the left lane is clear? Here’s something people don’t know about tailgaters. They’re so busy laser focused on your brake lights, waiting for you to slam on the brakes, that they don’t pay attention to anything else. Including their speed. So I sllllllowly speed up. We’re talking 1mph every 5 seconds or so. I keep this up until we reach traffic or they realize how fast we’re going and slam on their brakes. “I’m not going to risk a speeding ticket!” You say. Well here’s the best part. That cop is going to see them tailgating you at 30+ over the speed limit and they’re going to ask them wtf their problem is and ask if you’re ok. That person gets a free ride to the station and you get let go. “Why didn’t you call the police?” “Didn’t want to use my phone.” “Why didn’t you slow down or pull over?” “I tried and they ran out and tried to attack me so I was trying to escape!” Has worked 3 times so far (Woman in a Honda Pilot, guy in a G37, guy in a Chrysler town and country.)"

"Dude, this is the most annoying shit ever. Please stop it, especially if it’s obvious that it’s untrue.  Had a guy in my art class who was really good and ALWAYS said “nah, it’s shit” to his own work, no matter how detailed our feedback was. It comes off as insincere, implicitly insulting and it discourages unbiased feedback because he’s demonstrating himself as a vulnerable person who would be wounded by any critique.  If you think you’re doing well, don’t be afraid to pat yourself on the back for it. If you want recognition, ask people “hey, I’ve been working on X, how am I doing?”, whether in regards to your work or being a good friend. Don’t force people to give out complements because they’d feel awkward telling their friend “yeah, actually I don’t think you have a great moral compass”."
This is such a hard balance though. I'm a pretty socially awkward person so I find it's easier to just not talk but I wasntvalways like that. I always insisted on being honest but I s2g its situational. People are confusing and idk how everybody else doesn't find them so comfusing.

"It is rude to ignore someone who walks up while you're talking to someone else.  Just acknowledge them even if they don't join the conversation.  This happened to me once when I started a new job...didn't know anyone there, and was just trying to be friendly.  They were outside on a cigarette break. They told me not to""butt in"".  I got the hint and left, but felt bad.  Later, my father told me they were the ones being rude"
"Someone who screams, ""I'm very insecure"""
"I've definitely struggled with this personally. Not being sure if I'm dominating conversations because I like the limelight or if it's just that I'm a ""conversation mover""(probably column A column B). Over the past few years I've picked up on what I think is a really important difference which is the difference between active listening and passive listening.  I honestly enjoy listening to people that contribute to the conversation and the ""flow"" of the topic being discussed. But sometimes there are people that will just ""wait their turn"" to talk. You can sometimes determine who these people are by noticing if the topic has changed and that person does the ""anyways..."" thing and brings it back to what they were trying to say in the first place."
"I do it but I feel I have to due to how I was raised my family is vicious towards one another. On the other hand nothing anyone says about me outside of my family hurts me. Or so I say. I guess it beats hitting myself for my mistakes which I did as a kid. I tend to put it this way. A kid in the firehouse tries to do a burn on me. I get to say kid  I’m fat, bald and I avoid my family whenever possible. You have to try harder to do better then my own family did when I was a kid. I truly am full of self loathing on a level you just can’t compete with. It’s true. Nothing hurts me that anyone says because I think worse of myself. Sorry to go off on a rant."
"As an insecure person, I feel the need to gossip about anyone and everyone. At all times. A classic. I hate this part of myself. I like those people that I gossip about but, I just can't seem to stop.  Maybe its to fit in and have something to talk about with others, or maybe its to make myself feel better about myself. I dont know.  But after many incidences, I thought why should I let my insecurity hurt others? That's just selfish.  So I decided a few weeks back, I'll change for the better. I downloaded a habit tracker to curb this and I THINK its working :)  If you really want to make yourself feel better, be good to people honestly. That's what I realised. Being mean to others will make you feel terrible about yourself actually. Don't let your own insecurity be a burden for others."

"My mom has a tacky thingy that links my phone to hers and vice versa. It's the life360 app I think. She can see my location and vice versa. People think it's  crazy, but I have to tell them I really don't mind. She didn't force it on me. She just wants it to check up on me once and awhile and make sure I'm home safe. She's a very worrisome mother, but she's also the best one I could ask for. I'm okay with having the app on my phone because it gives her peace of mind.   And theoretically, if something did happen to me, for example if I got kidnapped, the app would show a lot of information about my last whereabouts."

"Oh I get what you're saying and im glad you got that girl help in the end. But don't you see how your comment would come across to any young teenager reading here? That first comment was so blase and im telling you it stings. I'm well past my traumas and im a big girl now but I see how that would stick in my mind back in the day. You made it sound like just because she didn't present ""appropriately"" (wasn't honest, has no obvious signs of trauma, looks whiney and needy and disruptive ect) she wasn't worthy of help. And yeah. Sorry, regardless of how you feel about the kid and what is going on  (I dunno, regardless of what she's done and what you've said you can't actually discount the possibility of real trauma there. That sounds like a girl pleading for help who doesnt really know how to me but you can only do so much. I'm just saying maybe don't hate her so much for being so difficult? You don't actually know why. You obviously have your own ideas, which is called bias, and they may or may not be 100% accurate. I dunno. She's obviously a kid you're obviously an adult. Maybe don't assume her entire character at this stage in development?) I just think that comes off as gross. And she might just be a shitty attention seeker (although from my understanding of childhood psychology attention garnering behaviour to these extremes are usually indicative of something and shouldn't be dismissed) but someone out there could be behaving like your first comment and be in serious distress, easily swayed from asking for help in fear of this type of judgement (that they're just an attention seeker).  And I mean, that's you isn't it? As a teenager my ptsd stopped me from participating in gym plenty. I would never of told ANYONE it was specifically because my body made me sick to my stomach and exercising in front of others gave me an anxiety attack akin to a heart attack but I got creative with my excuses too (and sometimes I was sneaky and I used my history of trauma as PART of that excuse. I would never ever admit to what was really happening in my mind. But what you already know can't hurt me or you right? So I leaned on that a lot too). I'm not saying that's going on. I'm just saying there is more then 1 what it's and you're mighty dismissive...   And I mean, doesn't that depend on the animal and where you get them from? From what I've looked into myself, here (which is probably a different country), some animals are trained through service agencies and given both service accreditation as well as extra training for emotional services. I've gone on to work in disability and I've seen these dogs do wonders with children during a meltdown, so that's all I can say. And yeah... the last time I attempted suicide a service pupper would have been far more helpful then the dodgy rope i had. You're being really discounting of something that genuinely helps a lot of people because they inconvenience you.   Well, yes, and that's what I was saying. If the channels aren't being followed put your big girl panties on and do what it takes. I'm not a mandatory reporting with the privilege of an inbuilt system to follow. But I have helped random children through the process because someone had to and no one else around them were taking the steps that needed to be because ""beaurocracy"". Was it shit for all of us involved? Yes. I just had to work harder to protect her where I could and trust the services that needed be used. Not saying it isn't a hard process. But you do what you have to do and it is what is it. You made it sound like calling the police was an inconvenience you wanted to avoid."

"Constantly apologizing for things you shouldn't apologize for. For example, calling me and saying ""Oh, i'm sorry, am I disturbing you"". If you were, I wouldn't have answered the phone.   Asking rather than saying (for example, Can I have?... at a fast food drive through, rather than.... I want, or just the item. They know you want the food. You wouldn't be sitting at the drive though if you didn't want a big mac. They wouldn't be there if they weren't selling Big Macs. Just tell them what you want. You don't have to ask ""if"" you can have it).   I have a friend who does these and I'm constantly after her about it--in a nice way. She's getting better (sigh).   Bragging about what you did. But caveat to this, I know someone who is very skilled and has done a lot in a very male dominated profession. Whenever she mentions anything about it, even casually or to a direct question, no brag, men come out of the woodwork to tell her A. She's lying or B. She's exaggerating. Sometimes it gets so tiresome she loses her shit and goes off. That's not her being insecure but just getting bloody sick of the attacks on her person/ experience and deciding she has a right to voice her accomplishments in the face of constant attacks on her integrity. There is a difference."

Just walk beside me and be my friend, and together we will walk in peace again."""

"i’ve found that people who think it’s a “competition” as to who has life the hardest (meaning that they think they always think that they’re life is the worst) are pretty insecure. they always seem to make conversations into “poor me” and as frustrating as it is cause they seem to lack empathy for other people’s situations besides themselves, I think it speaks a lot to their lack of self esteem and their own insecurities."
"Here's the real question,  Are you more insecure if you're just stating a negative self perception that you recognise as fact?  Because that's what I do."
I feel like some people are just writing traits of people they dislike or are jealous of.
"And then when they're called out on it, they pull the ""Well, everyone agrees.  If you're surrounded by assholes, that means you're the asshole."""
In what possible way could participating in one of the world's largest forums/social media sites suggest insecurity?

"One of my brothers gets in on a bit, but it’s definitely more the women. I even have had a SIL on one side of the family ask me if I thought her kids were “more advanced” than other kids because I have so many nieces and nephews (12). It was fucking weird."

"Heh,  I only think that when I'm not wrong."
Honestly the two of you are just adorable and a treat too. I could probably listen for hours.
This question is very bad for insecure people.
I know someone who constantly roast everyone and usually people just play along and take the joke because it's not that big of a deal but the minute someone gives him the slightest bit of very clearly jokey criticism he basically throws a temper tantrum and won't talk to you

"The thumbs up response triggers me so hard. I don’t even know why, but I automatically read it as a “Go fuck yourself.” Or “Cool story bro.” I’d much rather have a k, or anything else. It just seems so abrupt, it always leaves me feeling disrespected. Like, someone not acknowledging the end of a phone call with bye and just hanging up."
"Hyperlexic children also aren't geniuses.  Learning to read at a young age before formal education begins really ain't as hard as people, parents may think. Some parents can figure out how to get their child to read before school starts (there are tricks actually), and some kids have an early interest and if their parents pick up on this bam you got a dumb kid who can read but kid is still dumb. Ask my dad.   He says he taught me to read when i was about 3 or 4 because I asked him to, because I'd see him read the newspaper. So he sat down and would read to me and my mom read to me every night, took me to the library every week, played letter games with me everywhere we went. I liked letters, still do but I was pretty dumb if you ask my dad."
"Maybe, if it's done to be liked. I think if it's done because you're scared it's probably something else - like anxiety.   There's a subtle difference.   Insecurity - people grow out of - people don't tend to grow out of anxiety."

Pretending to know the answer to questions you have absolutely no clue about.   Had an ex who did this constantly. Someone would ask if it was going to rain tomorrow and he would confidently answer no even though he never checked the weather report. I once asked my friend about her mother’s heart surgery and he chimed in with an answer for her even though he never met the woman and wasn’t familiar with her condition. My brothers would be discussing sports and inevitably ask something along the lines of “how many RBIs did so and so have that year?” and my ex would interject some random number even though he didn’t follow the team or sports in general. There’s so many example but it just completely baffled me. No one expected him to know these things and most of the time the question wasn’t directed at him but he would so confidently offer these answers that he had no business offering. It was so bizarre. I soon realized he was just very insecure and wanted to be seen as knowing things he didn’t know. It was exhausting.
"This immediately made me think of ""My dad could beat up your dad"""

"People can be insecure and hide it really well, you shouldn't assume.  However, if you're being 'fake' nice in a desperate way - like desperate to make a good impression and to be liked it's insecurity.  Like an underlying feeling that if you're not 'nice' people won't like you.   Like people wouldn't like the 'real' you. That's insecurity."
Pathological narcissistic personality disorder.  Did I guess right?
Yeah I would call that insecurity if you argued with someone who insulted a song you like.

"One of the main recurring messages of The Good Place is that choices have far-reaching positive and negative consequences, even if you're not aware of them at the time or choosing them willfully.  In that scene Chick-Fil-A is just another example of that.  Her phrasing is ambiguous but that show is all about how ethical and ultimately good/bad your actions are, not social appearances... otherwise Tahani wouldn't have been such a central character."

"Oh, I was agreeing that mothers are the most common culprits here, I'm just not sure as to why, is what I meant to say.  But yeah, that is weird. For whatever reason I had an Aunt who prided herself on the accomplishments on my then baby cousin, saying he could use the potty and speak comprehensible sentences, but was shy around people so we never saw it.  My mother then tried one-upping her by telling a very made-up story about how I was much more advanced than even that, and it continued from there."

"Your comment is asking if it is insecure to degrade yourself to hear others deny it, it is the answer to the question ""what screams ""i am very insecure""?"". You have already confirmed that this is an insecurity, so the only reason for you to be asking if this is infact an insecurity; is that you want someone else to say it's not an insecurity or it's not so bad. If you were doing this on purpose it is very funny. If not, your insecurity is so deep that you can't admit without creating a massive space of denial where others can comfortably say that yes you are in fact not (insert bad thing here)."
Me. I do. I scream that.

"I mean I know it's kind of a cop out but don't think about it.  I mean think about making eye contact, but as soon as you actually make that contact consider it done.  There's no hard and fast rule.  Tbh it's fairly noticeable when someone's forcing eye contact. It's just going to take you time to get comfortable looking at someone's face when they're talking to you.  You can use their social ques on when to break away, such as when they do, or if they're talking with their hands a lot. But that's going to put you back into thinking about it too much.  The best thing you can do is realize it's not an issue, and that the person talking to you is just as self conscious even if they aren't showing it. So try letting your eyes just follow the flow of the conversation with them."

"I'm glad I could help!  Dont get your self down. I've struggled with it my whole life, and taking life a little less serious (obviously in moderation) has made my quality of life that much better.  Theres no application police thatll come arrest you for sending too many out.  It's kind of like dating, except all you have to do is write a little essay about your self and hit submit.

"understand that life has a habit of changing. it is not always the best thing, but none of the shit you´ll face will permanent either.   it is not raining all the time, in metaphorical sense. conserve your energy. instead being burnt out because something is working, focus on trying to make what actually works better even if its just a tiny tiny tiny thing.  this way you´ll start enjoying the small things in life eventually. feeling of bitterness is really fucking draining and you cannot hide that. ever.  ... but at the same time, if you happen to be ok with what you got - it radiates from you.  feeling content is the best look out there."
"Whether or not anyone is a “good” person its not fucking up to them to verbalize that judgment. Its up to those around you to decide lol. Anyone that professes that they are a good person sets off a red flag with me instantly. Everyone thinks they are a good person. I leave those judgements to others and continue to behave in a way thats “good” to reinforce that. But thats kinda where i struggle in interviews of being asked about myself. Like why would you ask me if im good at something, this is an interview, i will only say what is positive lol"
"God i feel this.  Personally I am coming to discover that my sensitivity to rejection has A LOT to do with the fact that I'm adopted.

Comparing yourself to responses to this question for 30 mins.
I had a friend in town and we were supposed to meet up. But I felt super sick and ended up falling asleep so I didn’t answer any of her texts until like 3 hours later. She and this other girl she was with thought I was lying and immediately unfollowed me on Instagram.  Both women were in their 30s.
Someone I know posted “I’m literally the most humble person you could ever meet”. I had to laugh at the irony.
"Here's how it works.  Sharing a nice thing: ""I got married last weekend, it was such a great day!""  Response: ""Congratulations! Tell me all about it, where was the ceremony....""  Humble bragging: ""I just got married to this incredible woman, she's an underwear model, I don't know what she's doing with a slob like me. And, you know, I thought maybe we would have a few friends over, get a justice of the peace, but she really wanted her big day and to go to her favorite place in Monaco, you know, with my salary I really can't justify not giving her the $50,000 wedding she wanted, right? I mean, such a bother for a big event like that, what a headache! It's really lucky she has so many connections because of her modeling and her work in Hollywood, it made things much easier, Brad and Angelina were the best, they helped so much, you know they still get along and co-parent. They are really much more boring than you'd expect... ""  Response: **crickets*\*"
"It's a form of emotional abuse. I feel as though its not intended, and therefore is not malicious in that they may not even know they're doing it. So calling attention to it, and having both people understand that it's manipulation/abuse can help (if the perpetrator is open to examining themselves) the perpetrator recognize it and take steps to stop doing it.   If you're both (honestly, mostly just the one using it as a weapon) emotionally mature enough, this is something that can be worked through, and you both come out stronger, and as better people (with a stronger relationship).    However, if the perptrator is not up to the task of being open and willing to examine themselves...then this will not stop. It's an intrinsic part of how they see the world, and it takes a great effort to change. It can be done, but only if the perpetrator is willing and up to the task."

"This will get buried, but I always assume someone has a negative opinion of me, even if all I did was say ""hi"" to them in my usual shy tone.  Yeah...I know what you're thinking. Just kidding, I don't know, but I'll likely overthink it and conclude you think I'm pathetic. Rough exaggeration, but you get my point."

People putting other people down so they seem like they are secure and confident but they are really insecure asses.
"What constitutes ""messing up""?"
"Try having a lazy eye, every time I make eye contact talking to a stranger there’s a good chance they’ll look over their shoulder and say “are you talking to me?”"
Stop doing this. Negative self talk is harmful. Do it enough snd you’ll believe it for real. Work on loving yourself and caring more about what you think of yourself than the opinions of others.

"Also I've been that girl in your story missing out on help because of the other girl in your story. When I was in high school it made me really angry too. This chick used to use the back of scissors in class to make scratches all up her arms just so she looked like she self harmed, among other overtly attention seeking behaviour. Which used to drive me INSANE. Firstly, because she showed them off and did them so publically. Why?! I did everything I could to hide what I felt was the shameful evidence of my absolute self hate... I didn't think they were cool at all. One day she caught a glimpse and decided to make friends with me and we ended up talking and I ended up visiting her at her house. Despite what I felt was obsessive vanity she was an okay chick and we had a few things in common. She was getting way more help then I could have dreamed of. To me her home life was blossoming, in comparision. The type of support she had I would very well have killed for at the time. But you know what? Turns out she was pretty fucked up and really just needed some genuine people in her life and some time to process some things. Sure she coped much differently then me but who was I to say how she should cope and what should or shouldn't be traumatic to her? Despite our differences once we got through our walls we realised we were both experiencing a lot of pain. And it might have come from different places but it was the same. We didn't stay friends, we were very different, but I kinda understood after that and stopped giving her as much flack. It's years later now and we're both adults now and she's actually thriving. Maybe if I got the help she had I would be too but what a selfish focus that would be. I'm just so happy to see her doing well fighting those demons. I'm glad one of us could overcome something. So I don't resent the help she got when we were growing up and I don't judge her anymore for how attention seeking I felt she was at the time. And I try to give the grace to other people I see in my life who might be struggling in a similar way under the surface there.   And that's the anecdote that sparked my response to your comment. Maybe it will give you more clarity over what I was trying to say then my rambling did."
Similarly. Never talk something good about themselves by fear of being seen as if they're bragging.
IM VERY INSECURE
The constant updating with selfies
When I'm friends with a girl and her boyfriend holds the handshake for longer than necessary. Bonus points if said girl has a dress code from her bf too. It's also a bit suspect if a dude decides to make a comment about a handshake; this one is hit or miss and really depends on when and why they criticize your handshake.
"I’m in my first semester in a masters program and I really feel that last sentence. I’m in a great program and love my department/colleagues but it’s literally making me severely depressed. And if I bring up that it is, I get told everyone is struggling and that’s “just how grad school is” or it will make me stronger. I feel like I get punished for being smart and not struggling in the ways the other students do, but also I’m struggling so much with my research that it leaves me in tears every day. I love academia but sometimes it really can be toxic."
constantly thinking your significant other is cheating or checking someone else out when they haven’t done anything wrong in the past and for no apparent reason.

Loudly vocalize to a large group of humans that you posses a distrust  other humans or in another way present a firm of paranoia.
Yeah but sensible lifts arent really what the post was referring to sure a small amount of lift can help get through sketchy terrain but there is people who lift there truck 12+ inches to the point they need a damn step ladder to get in the truck. People who do this kinda stuff spend well over 30k on there truck I know a few people who did it which is definitely more than enough to own a small commuter car and a good vehicle for offroading. They did not do it for that though they did it because the big lifted truck look was what they enjoyed.

Pretty much everything Trump does.   Brags about his own intelligence.  Has to be an expert on everything. Can’t stand to be wrong or corrected. Doesn’t think there is anything he can learn.  Constantly insults everything and everyone. Makes everything about himself.  Has to be the world’s greatest at everything. Has to make everything about himself all the time.   How anyone can look at this guy and think he would make a good leader is beyond me.

I do the self deprecating jokes a lot and time them as a twist and people do laugh a lot. But then recently me and my girl friends got to talking and they think that it is a negative because it makes me sound like I am not confident.

But now I believe that there is 2 way to see it and their way is probably the more natural way. I will still doing it

"There's definitely a taste of ""Are you fishing for compliments?"" That I don't like about people, but that is not the same as someone who is self deprecating. I can smell it on someone if they're full of shit, but I can also tell when someone is coming from a place of real sadness or self hate.  If you're just shitting on yourself with no humor, it's sad. If it's obvious you're fishing for compliments it's shameful. Somewhere in the middle is what I like to call humanity."
"""being extremely aggressive in traffic""..."
"I grew up in the era of social media. Anything and everything gets a special spot in chat rooms, forums, Myspace, facebook, Instagram, the works.  If my insecurities got too much for me, I'd block someone and rant about it. If it was too bad, I'd deactivate that particular social media account.   Over time I started to see a pattern which prompted me to start asking very person questions about myself. Why do I feel the need to remove myself from the world's eye. I must be doing something my subconscious deems ""not good"".  I decided to take a year off of social media. Deleted everything (nothing is truly gone unfortunately) and learned a lot about myself in the process. I was a super shitty person disguising myself as a moral person. It was all a pretty lie.   Social media was a way for me to try and force others to see the fake me, the fake me who was moral and truly humble. In reality I was a bitch who looked down on everyone and judged anyone and everyone. They were all beneath me. In reality I was dirt.  Now I've learned to take a step back and listen to others. I'm still a work in progress of course. We all are in one way or another.  Edit: spelling"
Not being able to compliment or congratulate another person.
Pointing out flaws in others for no reason
"I do that, but I have a bad memory. I've gotten to the point where I go, I've probably said this 100 times so stop me if I have. Or I'll see the look on their face like, ""again?""and I usually pretty quickly stop."
"&gt;‘don’t worry about those who talk behind your back, they’re behind you for a reason’   I've never heard that and I kinda like it. My workplace has a ton of toxic people who talk shit about each other constantly.   I've become a topic of scrutiny recently because I'm late often and had to call out a few times. I have sick family, and my father has become disabled due to stroke. My bosses know, so I'm not penalized for it and apparently it's pissing quite a few people off despite the word about my family somehow having gotten around anyway.    So I'm going to let this one sit in my head for a while. It'll help keep me grounded. I interpreted it as not taking to heart because being behind me means they don't know what it's like, and that's okay."
"Asking ""What screams 'Im very insecure'?"""
"Famous attractive ppl would most likely be super insecure because they have thousands of people discussing their looks, talent etc online every day. Imagine if you could jump online at any moment and find 100 posts about you getting fat or bald or your eyes being too close together?   I’m pretty sure many celebs have to ban themselves from searching their name, as it makes people crazy.   This isn’t a “boo boo, celebs have it so hard” post,  I’ve heard actors mention in interviews they have to stop googling themselves because it becomes a kind of masochism after awhile. Like r/roastme dialed to 11."
"Right?  You either don't trust you SO to not fuck anything with a pulse, or you don't trust you friends to fuck your SO.  It's just a lose/lose situation."
People who take on a nice-guy persona and then impose in ways that a long-time close friend might. Like staying over at your place into the night no matter how hard you hint that you want to go to bed... or even assuming they can crash on your couch. Leaving stuff at your place. Inviting themself to your outings with your friends. Etc.  And if you told them to stop they would enumerate all the ways they were so nice to you and how you're the jerk...
"A person who is very insecure, having a deep and personal conversation with someone while at a concert."
"Some use. But then... Um... No. So, so much, no.  First of all, regardless of what someone's ""disabilities"" or traumas are, there's an appropriate way to act. Destroying school property and then bragging about it on social media? No. There are consequences for actions, and having a disability doesn't excuse you from them. She *should* have been expelled, since setting anything on fire in a school building is illegal.  Second, there's reasonable accommodations, and then there's expecting everyone to bend to make the world comfy and cozy for you. If you're reading this and you're suicidal, get help! But this post isn't about that. It's about the phenomenon of people reading a bunch of romanticized nonsense on Tumblr or half a Wikipedia article and deciding they have an illness. In this case, the fact is, there is no record on file for a doctor recommending any PTSD accommodations for this girl with the dog in school. The fact is, the girl didn't even have a formal PTSD diagnosis. She had no doctor's note about being allowed to skip classes, no psychologist's recommendation for coping mechanisms on file for teachers to be able to accommodate her, nothing. Just a note from her parents. That's not *supposed* to be enough to get a student a nurse's bathroom pass, let alone enough to be allowed to bring what basically amounts as a pet to high school, where kids with asthma and severe allergies can't focus or be in the same room with you because you want your dog in there. There's no medical reason for it, therefore you shouldn't have it when it's making other kids physically sick in my classroom.  Third, I have plenty of reason to hate this girl. She didn't get expelled for setting school property on fire because her family blackmailed another teacher into taking the fall for her. That same teacher has been under multiple investigations for sexual misconduct with this particular student because SHE has a crush on THEM and gets shit started when she feels bored or jealous when they try to date someone else. That someone else was ME. She tried to get me fired because I called her out on that bullshit. I don't know how you feel about having to explain your dating life to your boss, but it's really sucky! It's also sucky to get dumped so your ex can keep his job because a teenager has a crush on him and is willing to lie and get her parents to lie to ruin his life if she doesn't like that he is interested in someone else. The only good things that came out of it for me was that I saw how spineless he really was and how messed up that school was. The school is basically trying to get her passed on and out so they can stop wasting resources on her drama. It's an inner city Title 1 school. That means it's a poor school district and there is not enough money to spend on ramping up liability insurance or paying lawyers to investigate the same teacher over allegations that are proven false EVERY SINGLE TIME. I get that you don't know her or the situation, and maybe you're trying to be nice and do a good thing here, but that girl was, and will always be, a lying, manipulative brat.   Fourth, that's just half of what she's done. I could go on about other students she has hurt and used, but, I won't. Do you really, truly, honestly believe a girl that hung up on herself deserves an ounce of anyone's pity at this point? After all her crying wolf about bullies, rumors she started herself, throwing her so-called best friends under multiple buses, and claiming illnesses she has no formal diagnosis of, do you really think for a second that any of it is real? You're right. She probably has issues. But, as someone who works with disabled kids, you know as well as I do that there's a right way and a wrong way to cry for help. This girl, if she really needs it, is crying in all the wrong ways. Sadly, she still gets what she wants, so she's not really learning anything. And that's all a big IF. She's willing to lie to hold a man's career hostage; don't you think she's probably willing to lie to get accommodated for an illness she doesn't have?  Fifth, whatever problems she has, a dog isn't going to fix them. And that dog is illegal in a school building without a service dog license. And, to be frank, whatever problems she has aren't worth multiple kids having asthma attacks because the dog sheds like crazy. There's six science classrooms. She can go be in one of them. I did the right thing by my students. According to new posts from this school year, it looks like she got a whole new dog, a breed that doesn't shed nearly as much. So probably I wasn't the only one that brought it to the school's attention that this was a health hazard for job reason. Like I said, there's reasonable accommodations, and then there's a spoiled brat who has read too much Tumblr doing everything under the sun to get her way.  Sixth, I think we agree on a lot here. If the girl with the dog had some legit paperwork for the dog, a legit diagnosis, anything to back up her claims, I would be ten times more understanding. But there wasn't. It's also a million times more frustrating to have support staff so encumbered by pointless paperwork that a girl with obvious, legitimate and immediate needs has to rely on an untrained sub to get her help without any guidance instead of people that are put there to help her and have all the resources at their fingertips. I think I could agree with more of your points if it were a different case. However, it's not. This same school refused to expel another student for raping a girl on campus. Mom took it to the cops and is trying to sue the district for not moving the rapist elsewhere. The district could have handled so many things so much better than it did. There were tons of misplaced priorities there, including sucking up to the press and making things look good to a disillusioned  public. Raped girls apparently weren't one of them. Nor raped boys, for that matter, but that's another post."

"Just being me- I hide it all away, put a smile on my face and walk to class to make others happy and be the strong friend with a shoulder to cry on. Many people show it, but the ones who don’t are the ones who really have it rough. I’ve got a friend who we finally were able to get help, coming from an abusive family, who just seemed like a normal kid until one day I said something and he told us everything that was happening. He was the strong friend in his group, you really gotta look out for the strong friends, we may look fine but most of us are really struggling."

"The problem you run into if you try to judge people mainly by their intentions is that everyone has good intentions. EVERYONE.  Many of the most evil atrocities commuted were done by people who believed they had legitimately good intentions. If you have truly convinced yourself that one race or ethnic group is dragging the rest of society down, then in your own mind you can justify genocide as the necessary evil to bring about a greater good. In a sick twisted way, that falls under the category of good intentions."

"I do this. Especially with positive, funny, or just things I want to remember. Writing them helps but I don't want to bother people with what is not really that much of an interesting moment. To be fair, I am insecure, which is why I don't contact people directly. I'll them them if I meet them, but I don't really know how to directly contact people unless ii have something to ask/give/set up for IRL. Also, if I tell someone in a DM they might start a conversation and I might not have time for it, whereas a wall post is done once you've shared it from the loo.   I like the on this day function, it helps me remember things like that too.   It's my wall, I'm sure people have better things to do than read it if it's boring, but it's nicer than just keeping it to myself."

"The cousin of my boyfriend is so insecure that it's embarrassing. He knows that the mood shifts negatively when he comes in cause he keeps filling up every moment of silence with his insults and unnecessary comments. For example, a friend of ours is a good guitarist and he says, ""God you're so talented but completely useless. You're so lazy and blah blah blah.""  I've seen this guy stay in his room for a whole week, sleeping and laughing at South Park.  When he knows he's not part of the conversation, he tries to butt in by joking about people's weaknesses and insecurities. He also adamantly tries to argue with anyone that does not agree with his opinion on various topics.  He tries his best to put people down and minimize their accomplishments because he has none of his own."
Looking around for potential sniping spots wherever you go. Or is that paranoid. Or is that too much gaming
I do that. At least I am self aware enough to know that it is just insecurity and not reality. So I can mostly push those thoughts out.

The why doesn’t matter at all. You can talk about whatever you want and be a good conversationalist as long as you read the room and pay attention to if you’re overly dominating conversation or if everyone is bored. If you feel you did either: ask someone a question about their self and change the subject.

She acts so holier than thou and condescending on social media — and totally the opposite of who she is/what her life is like in actuality. It astounds me that she can be so openly hypocritical. I don’t call her out on it myself. Can’t figure out if I’m a coward for that or doing the right thing and minding my own business. Nearly every tweet of hers makes me roll my eyes to the back of my head though, because they are so ridiculously hypocritical."

Otherwise it's only slightly louder than standard, but the actual exhaust note is so much better from inside the car across the entire rev range.  It's a similar setup on my bike with the Black Widow exhaust, but it's louder at low revs/throttle than my car's exhaust. Not loud enough to wake the neighbours, but noisy enough to drown out quite a bit of the wind noise in my helmet.

"My coworker does this but in a more insidious way. He’ll find a flaw in your work habits and point it out to you, but he’ll do it in such a way where he’ll get you to verbally admit your mistake. They’re small things, but they add up at the end of the week. Like if he sees that you haven't organized some paperwork he’ll ask you how that’s going, then smirk when you say you haven't gotten to it. You’d think he’s looking out for you but he never offers any solutions. He’s often offended if someone does that to him and will explode over the tiniest of criticisms. He’s my coworker, not my boss."
"I mean the idea that kids having innocent/awkward fun, people who aren't completely normal acting not completely normal but harmless, people enjoying stuff a lot--none of these are that cool to laugh at. A lot of cringe culture just revolves around thinking people are idiots for enjoying themselves in harmless ways.   So neither of those, really. The popular idea of ""cringe"" just needs to go."

"Came here assuming I would check every box..but as I continued reading the comments, I slowly realized something.

Basically, he *wanted* a military parade for Veteran's Day 2018, was told it was too expensive, and his administration came up with this as an alternative. I really don't see where you're going with this. He still held a rally for the purpose of boosting his ego, it was still a massive waste of resources, and whether it was in motion or stationary seems to be of entirely secondary importance."

"Thank you. I only see it pays off in that I don't get angry at the person, so I don't get tripped up and say anything cruel or distracting.  In the long run, I hear back from people that have memories of arguing with me and that how I spoke to them stayed with them, and they eventually considered my perspective and saw that they did agree, and had not been listening at the time because of some minute difference in how we worded things.  I only really say what I can stand by, and it works out. A lot of folks don't really think about things that way."

In fact I don't even know if my experience is necessarily better than yours.  But isn't the fact that this bothering you mean that it's you that is insecure?  I've heard people give me their experiences after I've said something, and it doesn't bother me a bit.  Discussion topics are about incidents, not specific people.  Am I missing something?"

"i used to be so incredibly insecure around other women when i was a kid and up until my mid twenties (i was very poor growing up and therefore not well groomed and bullied). i was sooo jealous of other women and had this ""I'm a COOL girl, I'm just one of the guys, I'm not like other girls blah blah complex. I would chug whiskey and fight trying to gain the approval of men. I would be excessively crude and loud.

Like, if she's an hour later than she should be I want to make sure she's okay and not dead or injured from a car crash or somethjng. It would be better if I could just call her but she always keeps her phone on silent and rarely answers. Which is also fine, I don't want to suffocate her lol. I just want to make sure we're always able to find each other if something bad, (car wreck, God forbid abduction or something like that), were to happen.  I guess I'm insecure, but it's more that I'm insecure that something bad could happen and I wouldn't be able to be there to find her and help her if something bad *did* happen.   Plus it's nice to know when she's heading home from work so I can start dinner, or head home if my son and I are at the park, etc.    It helps my anxiety a lot when she's running late, (usually is lol, she just can't help it), and my mind starts racing like, did she get in a wreck? Is everything okay? And I check her location, see it's moving, and all is well"

So I called him out on it a lot. I started out constantly asking if there was something on me, behind me, or around me. Then after he noticed what I was doing, I told him that if he makes a conscious effort too look people in the eyes more, it would become a habit and he wouldn't have to think about it. So then after that I started just telling him whenever he would look away. He told me he had a problem with it before and wished he could change it.

Then meet up with your old high school friends and you’re all about short dresses and David Guetta.

Mind you, this friend was always a positive, supportive person. It—I—was weird and awkward and panicked all night. We seemed to part on polite terms, but I tried calling today and they’ve blocked my number. This is my life now."

I love using this to my advantage with a particular neighbor who does this all the time. He always moves the topic to something he knows everything about (or thinks he does) and dominates the conversation. What I've discovered is if I reciprocate the behavior and keep bringing the conversation to things he can't speak more authoritatively than me on after about 3 to 4 topic swaps he suddenly leaves. It's really helpful to have a way to get rid of someone who never shuts up and never leaves.

The more designer shit you own the more insecure I think you are. You're wearing stupid logos on your clothes for validation from strangers. The best part is when the people who are doing it are *broke* and complain about not having money. wtf..
"I'm not saying they should **only** be judged on intentions  I'm fully aware that in everyone's frame of reference they are a good person who would never do any wrong. I'm just saying the intent should **also** be taken into account. Because it tells you their reasoning which could show whether they have mental problems or are just stupid, both which deserve different judgements if you ask me"
"When you start panicking because you think talking about your talents is selfish and would make people feel bad about themselves, then feeling guilty for even thinking someone would feel bad about themselves for YOUR stupid talents, then feeling bad again because you thought you made someone feel bad for you after trying to apologize about talking about talents and insulting your self out loud somehow unconsciously, then feeling stupid for thinking someone would feel bad for you or even care, and then realizing that you just assumed you had talent at all.  Or just directly screaming, ""I'm very insecure"", and then secretly beating yourself up because you sound like an attention seeker."

"No. In fact reddit is far more liberal than conservatives. The reason the men one has more up votes is because you're coment is controversial. And people who are pro-mens rights are more likely to filter by controversial reddit opinions to see the comments they agree with. If you're looking for validation on pro-womens rights you have to look at the top comments of reddit. You'll almost never find a men's rights comment at the top of reddit, and are far more likely to find a women's rights one. Of course you won't get much support in the unpopular or controversial section of a sub because it's generally filled with people who go against the more pro-femininst narrative. What you're experiencing is not a reflection of all of reddit, but what life is like among the outcast opinions."
"Look, as a registered Democrat I hated Hillary and did not vote at all.

He’s an obviously full of shit presenter who sticks to nothing.  I am not your enemy, I am your friend. Let’s find everything that is wrong."

"I think you are right and you are wrong. I have a had a potentially cheating gf, actions developed a lot of red flags. She was very attached to me, and I her (not as much, but enough). I don't think she intended to do what she did, just naive, or maybe I expected a but much.   Now as you say we should have broken up. But there were 2 factors, ""potentially"" is very broad and just mistrust. I was aware I could easily be wrong. Second I was sick and being alone was certainly a factor after ending up reliant for the first time (trusting someone with my sickness and my illness got quite bad, unfortunately). My point being is secondly I don't think it insecure is the right word to describe being alone. Being truly alone with no friends or family, and way to get them (People often have other hurdles than severe illness) is very natural and very few people are okay with staying that way, especially without distraction or regular interaction.  Idk if this is just fringe or maybe I'm wrong. That's just my two cents and could be anecdotal. We're built socially in one way or another and I think it's just normal not so much insecure about ones self to fear or even feel terrible alone.  Edit: I forgot to add checking phones happened from time to time (with permission). Also wasn't because of my self worth, simply just not knowing or trusting actions (With their actions crossed my our boundaries). It did end though, once and understanding was met and time passed. Again maybe not the healthiest path, right or wrong."

"The place I grew up in was notorious for this. Anyone who had made something of themselves was always ""They must have had help from Mummy and Daddy""  I went overseas for a few years, then came back for a holiday at home before heading back again. I was the first person from my school friends that had travelled anywhere outside of our country. When I came back, nobody asked me about it at all, and then one night, we were sitting and drinking and telling mostly the same fucking stories everyone had heard a bunch of times, When I started to talk about something funny that had happened to me during my time away. At some point near the beginning I mentioned where it was that this happened and was met with a bunch of eye rolling and ""Here we go"" , when I asked what the fucking problem was, one of my ""Friends"" just straight out said that now that I had travelled, I though I was better than them and was going to brag about my big adventures and that they don't care and don't want to hear it.  Now, If I had come home and tried to drop the fact that I had been out travelling the world into every conversation, or started to talk down my home town and make unfavourable comparisons, I can see how that might deserve this kind of response, but the fact was I hadn't even mentioned it since returning because literally nobody had asked me ""How was your trip, where did you go? Ho long are you back for?(This was before email and digital photography was an option. Years before the ability to instagram the entire trip, so it's not even as if they had followed along with me online, or even knew where I had been)  I just said fair enough and about 2 weeks later I left town and went back to travelling. That was almost 20 years ago, I've been back to visit my parents, but I've never bothered to look anyone in my hometown up since then."

This made me upset because I wanted to make friends without them trying to make me feel bad constantly and ranting about how it's unfair that I won a contest or some crap. I ended up insulting myself and calling myself horrible in an effort to make people feel better about themselves. It kind of turned into a habit up until now.

I still don't get eye contact. I look people in the eye a lot when talking but it feels wierd to sustain it over long conversations. I feel like I'm just staring people out. Also when I try to sustain in others will often look around randomly so I guess I'm not the only one.
I will go ahead and just say I apply to a few of these but feel relatively secure. Genuinely curious on who feels secure and what makes them feel secure? Maybe I haven't quite reached it though I feel okay already.

"If that person has a history of cheating, it's semi-reasonable. If they don't, I think you may have been slightly overreacting. I won't say ""out of line,"" because this is tough stuff. But childhood friends are generally people who want to support us, not potentially ruin our relationships, and a day trip is not the same as an overnight.  At this point, and with a history like that, you might consider speaking to a therapist about the possibility of having c-PTSD (the c stands for complex, and this very much *is* a thing that can cause it.)"

Putting down other guys when you’re around females
"About 15 years ago I used to hang out with a guy who swore up and down that every urban legend that's come out since the mid-70s personally happened to him or one of his friends. For example:   * He was riding the Gravitron at the county fair and someone jumped into the center console and died. My friend claimed he was splattered with the man's entrails, and it was never on the news because the county fair makes a lot of money for the town and they didn't want bad press  * His girlfriend at the time could fit the entirety of a two liter coke bottle in her vagina.   * The entire 'car door hook hand' urban legend was a true story and it happened to one of his cousins.   * The entire 'I'm calling from inside the house' urban legend was also a true story and it happened to the same cousin.   * Somebody in his family took bad acid at Woodstock and was in the mental ward of our local hospital because he believed he had been transformed into a glass of milk, and he sleeps standing up because ""he believes if he is tipped over he will die"". Fun fact: Our local hospital didn't have a mental ward at the time.   * He claimed that the band Slipknot had an international trademark on the word 'maggot' and that if biologists used it they would be sued by the band.   * He'd tell anyone who would listen that he was a licensed doctor and also a psychiatrist, and that despite dropping out of high school he'd passed ""the medical exam"" and proved that medical school is a scam set up by big pharma.   * He was a self-proclaimed sovereign citizen, and believed he knew more about the law than any police officer or lawyer. Spoiler alert: he did not.   * He claimed to have an IQ in the high 160s, but for the life of him couldn't figure out how to pass a class, do his homework, or operate a condom. Last I heard he has five or six kids from different moms.   This is turning into a Kevin post but you get the idea."

"My first didn’t crawl til he was 13 months and walked at 18 months. My second crawled on her first birthday and is now 16 months and not walking yet.  On the other hand, I have friends whose babies walked and crawled at 8 months. Now they’re on equal footing with my kid. No one would know who started walking first and so on.  I also have a friend whose son was very advanced for his age and he would continually brag about it. Fast forward 13 years and their son is a very, very smart kid, who also happens to be on the autism spectrum.  You love your kids regardless. I personally enjoyed not having to chase my kids around before they were one. Because I’m exceptionally lazy and don’t enjoy baby proofing everything I own. Them crawling and walking later meant less effort for me!"

"&gt;they do it because they enjoy it  This is the standard line for all insecure people.  &gt;Also, people in the 70s and 80s got tattoos.  No, they did not. I was living then. No one did, except for a sailor from WWII or something, or very, very rare situation.  And again, there are so many people that I have seen who are 50-years-old and up, that are sporting brand new tattoos. I see it all the time. They got them because they are insecure, otherwise, why wouldn't they have got them when they were in their twenties? Why wait until 50? Because they want to be part of the in crowd, want to be ""cool"", which just screams insecurity to me.  But, as I said, it is hardly an issue of people 50+ years old. It is prevalent in all age groups. Everyone is insecure. But, those who smoke or get tattoos are particularly insecure.  &gt;Also, an opinion can't have a percentage behind it because statistics are subjective and an opinion is objective.   What??? I think you got these switched around. Statistics are objective and opinions are subjective. I realize this, but it is my opinion that 80% of smokers and people sporting tattoos are particularly insecure."
"When a person states a fact, you're not sure about it/not familiar with the subject, and proceed to research the fact, then they get upset. I can be a very analytical person.

You know that commercial circa 2000 that shows all these kids with special talents. They say at the end that ""nobody's good at everything, buy everyone's good at something!"" I feel like I don't have 1 single thing that I'm great at. Nothing worthwhile at least."
"I used to be very insecure about my feelings and my opinions. Now I relish in vulnerability. Someone telling me something that could make me think they're weird, makes me love them. It makes me feel more connected to them because it shows the human in them. We all feel unsure about things, we all like weird stuff and being able to get over the barrier and just share with others makes us feel connected. It also creates a space where nothing is embarrassing and that's what love is all about, both romantic and platonic."
"I make these jokes all the time, my friends just agree and add to it"
"My wife has a friend that constantly posts about how healthy and vegan she is, all the ""neat"" little activities she does, and how happy she is being single. I'm over here like, ""Who are you trying to impress?"" She low key comes off as depressed and overcompensating. I just want to tell her to eat a hamburger... and eat a dick too."
I think it'd be okay to turn off now but for a while I was afraid and I probably should have years ago and I have tried. I go through a break up cycle almost yearly. I don't know what's wrong with me or with him exactly but it's probably extreme low self-esteem on both sides.
"Having to explain/make excuses to every single one of us why he's wearing a pink shirt. ""I'm only wearing this because my other clothes are dirty.""  ""My dress shirt is pink 'cause my wife liked it and I couldn't say no.""  Like, Jesus Christ man. No one cares."

Not gonna lie but I was expecting some kind of encouragement because I just really needed some comfort. Instead, she proceeds to tell me about her week (and knowing her for 4 years, she is quite the exaggerator) which seemed like she was quite busy too. But I knew for a fact that she was lying about certain things (like the 1 hour event she told me earlier that week suddenly was a 4 hour event?) just so that she could one up me.

"Several mental illnesses, as well as being on the spectrum, still posess the ability to introspect.  The reason the majority of people don't, isn't that they can't, it's that they don't want to, introspection is rough, it's looking at all of the worst parts of yourself and admitting that they're caused, and exist because of yourself, that you're the person solely responsible for tearing them out and replacing them with actually good/healthy behaviours, that you were shitty/flawed in some way.  Especially in this society which views empathy and any kind of fault as absolute weakness."

Or, instead of some wild conspiracy that he's terrified at being compared to a bear, there's a far more reasonable explanation.

"I worked with a guy 25 years ago who was like that. We were working off in the bush at a remote power station, waaay away from civilization and anyone that cared. I had a orange shirt that had faded to a salmon colour, which he kept insisting was pink. He didn't like that I was wearing it. Well, maybe its pink, but who gives a fuck, and shut up about it.   I started to realize that he had some issues about then. Then he confirmed it with this gem.   He had wrapped black tape around his cigarette lighter, and I asked why. He said that someone out there had given it to him, and he wrapped it so nobody could see it was pink.   Everybody on site consisted of our boss, bosses wife, me, and him."
"I got out with my masters but same.

I don't wanna sell my soul, have to be split from family, and generally be stressed out of my mind for decades just to potentially have security eventually. I don't even care about publishing my work, because working with some of the people involved is so off-putting. But it upsets me to think about how it all might have been different if I went to a healthier program."

"If it counts for anything, I don't consider that ""insecure"" so much as very self conscious. Insecurity for me is about gaining security usually by stepping on others in some way. Being self conscious is a lack of confidence stemming from a hyper awareness of one's own weakesses... Something that I think is less likely to lead to poor character. Again though, just my opinion."

What really stuck this out to me was looking over my sketchbooks where I would literally write commentary like that on my art. Not constructive criticism but like, stuff making fun of it?"

"Being a hostile looking person. Sagging pants, snearing, tough guy demeaner, being rude all the time. Just screams how much you value macho and how insecure and uncomfortable you are with everything else."
"You would disagree with many who propose such. I believe it is a crime in Canada though. That said, many consider it hatred to deliberately ‘misgender’ someone. The same can be said for many similar things. For example, opposition to gay marriage is very often touted as hate, even if there is no hatred.  I think the point is that we have used these terms to such an overblown effect that they have lost all meaning. To a point where merely wearing a hat that supports the president gets you labeled a hater or a bigot. That sort of profiling is what I consider to be a big sign of insecurity. Imagine if someone saw a person wearing an Obama “Hope” t-shirt, and someone came up to them unprovoked and said “You must hate white people, the constitution and freedom.” Would you not consider such to be insecure?"
"I used to be like this, but then I swapped it around on its head and tried a different tactic: I think I'm ugly, overweight, awkward and stupid and assume everyone else does, so perhaps the joke should be that I act as if I'm handsome, fit, charismatic and smart to contrast that? It's no fun to see a sad fat guy, but if the fat guy's acting as if he's the bee's knees, there's a bit of irony there. And sooner or later that almost humorous fake overconfidence slowly started evolving into just confidence."

"My daughter is a whiz with words. She’s 3.5, and I swear, sometimes it’s like having a conversation with a full-grown adult. She’ll hear a song on a TV show and from then on, she knows the words by heart.  Potty training? The bane of her existence. She’ll wake up some mornings with a dry diaper, head straight to the potty, and have a great day with it. There are times that I’ll be walking her to the bathroom and when we get there, she’ll say ‘I just peed in my diaper.’ She’ll openly admit it wasn’t because she couldn’t hold it, or that she doesn’t understand what she needs to do. It’s just what she felt like doing, so she did it.  Our almost 2yo son? He’s not quite at half the words our daughter could say when she was 1.5yo. Do we care? Not even a little bit. He does other things *much* faster than our daughter did. He already understands the potty, what it’s for, and is making a *lot* of progress for a kid his age. I always make the joke that he’s waited longer to speak because his sister talks so much that it doesn’t leave much for him to need to say.  No need to freak out about it. Everyone is different, and there’s nothing wrong with that. He walked earlier than she did, she talked younger than him. But for all we know, she may end up being an Olympic runner and he a famed orator.   People forget the fact that these are *kids*. Like you said, if there are no disabilities present, then those milestones are almost irrelevant."
No it's true you seem like a goody two shoes that is really an asshole. The blabbering just makes it worse.

"This is a trait I see in successful people  The majority of people are neither secure nor insecure but follow others, and putting someone else down always seems to work and drag that majority into siding with them.

"People threatened by stuff that doesn’t affect them. I regularly hear (male) colleagues talking about how they have no issue with anybody that’s gay, but they “wish they’d stop ramming it down my throat all the time.” As a straight guy myself, I’ve never got how a guy being openly gay is in any way an attempt to ram his sexuality down my throat, so I can only assume that some other guys feel like that’s what’s happening because they’re insecure about some aspect of it - whether it’s their own sexuality or sense of masculinity, or something else, I genuinely don’t know. I also hear the same white guys in my office regularly saying similar about feminism and women’s rights, and around race and ethnicity. I’ve tried asking them about their views, I’ve tried explaining how it doesn’t affect them in my opinion, and when you speak to them about certain subjects they can seem decent, intelligent people, but they just have this massive insecurity about anybody that isn’t a straight white guy having the cheek to speak up about themselves."
"Bit frustrating. can't flirt, can't get closer to women without my gf siding up with me. Makes things a little awkward.  Flirting is my bread and butter, it's basically telling the other person I like them, not that I'm going to sleep with them."
Post their amazing relationship n mark her territory on the poor man all over Facebook... I hope you ditched that friend who couldn't see past herself to understand what you had gone through. In addition to disregarding your emotional pain she assumed you would be a bad friend.
"imo the distinction is if the opinion is asked for. You want honest opinions, you ask for it. You don't want negative opinions, you don't ask for opinions. If you still get negative opinions it's mostly rude."
This is a common thing with adults that didn’t learn how to cope with their a.d.d. I didn’t realize I did this a lot until I started losing friends and my therapist pointed it out. Started going to group therapy after that and I fixed it. Some people just need to hear it bluntly on what they’re doing that’s insecure

China's reactions to criticisms.
"They really piss me off, because I know what it's like when somebody really *is* just honest to a fault but genuinely cares about people. My mother was that way. No filter. If you asked her opinion, you got it, usually completely unvarnished. She once told her boss his new house color looked like ""sick baby shit"" because that was genuinely the first thing it reminded her of. She wasn't completely without tact, but she did have to actively work on it, and she was so direct and forthcoming when asked a question that you nearly always got whatever thought crossed her mind first. I suspect this was at least in part because she grew up in an abusive household, but that's only speculation on my part.  Thing is, though, she wasn't cruel or mean, and it was clear from a couple things. First, she never *volunteered* a negative opinion. She'd give out praise left and right if she thought it was warranted, but if she didn't have anything nice to say she didn't say anything unless asked. Second, if you asked her opinion and you were hurt by what she said, she would be genuinely sorrowful over it. Sometimes she would be surprised that someone took it personally, but she didn't blame them for the misunderstanding, she blamed herself for not finding a better way to say things, or not seeing that they were looking for validation rather than a critique, etc.  She was a very generous and loving person, and she was great if you wanted constructive criticism or to weigh the pros and cons of a decision. You just had to accept that if you asked her about something, she might say she didn't like it in a very blunt fashion, and that she didn't view it as a personal thing at all. I remember when, as a young teen, I decided to paint my room bright blue. She said it was an eyesore, but if that's what I wanted, that was what mattered. And she meant every word. She *did* think it was an eyesore, and this was not in any way a judgment on my own taste, and she was totally OK with this; it was just a difference of opinion and nothing more."

If I'm asked a question I'll also guarentee a genuine answer."
"People who act like giving you their time/attention/devotion is a ""gift"". You should ""cherish it and be grateful"".

Me
"I agree. Insecurity is insecurity no matter how it manifests. As long as you are not actively and intentionally hurting someone the way your insecurity comes out should be viewed for what it is.   For example, take 2 people Becca and Mandy. Becca is insecure about the way she looks, and is worried that people will look down on her. She is a decent bit overweight, she wears baggy clothes to help hide it, she tries to avoid attention for the most part, and she can come across as kinda rude and distant. Mandy is insecure too, she’s worried about what everyone thinks of her. She is a pretty girl by traditional standards, she is really into diet and fitness and has a great body. She wants attention to validate her self esteem and make her feel better. She wears yoga pants and tight shirts to show off her body, and always spends a good chunk of time getting ready and prettied up to go out, even for the most mundane things. She posts a lot of pics on social media in the hopes of getting likes.   Becca is insecure about her image, she cares too much about what other people think, she dresses to avoid attention, which she views as criticism, and she lets her insecurity impact her general day to day life. Mandy is also insecure about her image, she cares too much about what others think, she dresses to get attention because it makes her feel wanted. In that example both women are deeply insecure, they are in emotional pain, they stress about their situation, and just generally are not happy.   The difference is that much of what Mandy does would be called out ITT, her insecurity would be treated as a negative trait, people would make snide remarks, etc. Mandy is not hurting anyone.  Becca on the other hand is insecure, but when people speak of her insecurity they do so in a much softer and empathetic way.   In this scenario there is a third person, you and I. The way we view both people and there insecurities, the way we respond to them, is also determined by our own insecurities. Mandy is beautiful, she has the body many women would want and generally “has it all” from the outside. When we see her insecurities on display we think “ha, look at that, she ain’t so perfect after all is she. She’s definitely doing that for attention, what a loser.” We treat her way of compensating for insecurity, attention, as a negative thing. We take a cheap shot at her, we bring her down a bit. Maybe that is our own insecurity in action, maybe we are envious of her in many ways, so when we see an opportunity to bring her down a bit we jump on it. Talking down on someone who does something for attention to compensate for insecurities is a shitty thing to do. Getting attention never hurt anyone, and you don’t have to be a stereotyping asshole or bitch about it.   Becca on the other hand is cheered on, we yell her she’s awesome, that she’s beautiful just the way she is, and that she is free to be a confident and empowered woman. I’m not complaining about that, that’s a great thing to do, I’m just bringing to attention the way we treat her and her insecurities. When she posts a sexy picture on social media she is cheered on as being brave, confident, etc, whereas people snicker when Mandy does the same.   The same is true for many other things that people mention in this thread. Like a guy buying a big pickup truck. The dude is insecure so he buys a big truck to look cool, tough, etc. He is worried about how people will view him and his means of transportation. It’s not much different than a dude who drives a cheap beat up car around and always parks it away from where he is going, so people don’t see him driving it. He is worried about what people think about him and his means of transportation.   Many of these examples ITT are innocent things, but people have tacked on stereotypes to them in order to make them seem worse. Buying a big truck is not a terrible thing, not everyone who is insecure and buys a big truck is a douchebag or an asshole, in fact it’s probably a minority of them who are. Same goes for people wearing expensive clothes, taking lots of selfies, posting vague status updates, etc.   These insecure people are all suffering. They all have problems and issues that cause them pain. The way they deal with it and compensate for it isn’t always a laughing matter. I’ll admit that I often do poke fun at them for the things mentioned ITT, but sometimes that may be me just taking a cheap shot at a decent person because of my own insecurities. It’s me trying to knock them down a peg in my mind. It’s insecurity, and it’s often worse than what I am making fun of.   Sure there are assholes, douchbag, and bitchy things that people do because of their insecurities, but that is a completely different thing and does not always go hand in hand with all the stuff ITT. Most people are just good decent people trying to better their self-esteem in various ways."

What I'm saying is  When I'm away he picks fights  With everyone  The fact that he hasn't been expelled with the amount of weapons he had brought to school is amazing
"Oh god. I have a colleague at work that's like that. She seems to have picked me as a target to vent her frustrations (always per E-Mail, at least 3 times a week). Recently, she told me about her office mate (who is also female) and her body odor. Apparently she confronted her colleague several times about her armpit smell, and then decided to vent to me about it. I told her that I am not comfortable discussing a female coworker's hygiene. She didn't stop, and kept writing me E-Mails about it. I just stopped replying. She kept insisting that she is simply a very ""outspoken"" person, and that's just who she is.  The funny thing is: When she came to my office a few weeks later to discuss work, I literally had to hold my breath because of her bad breath. The smell lingered in my nose for hours, I kid you not. I wonder how she would react if I had been as ""outspoken"" about it to her as she was to her colleague."
That is still insecure
"This is probably my main issue. I have been unfortunate in that many ""friends"" or girls that I've been interested in would eventually start to avoid me as I would be apparently annoying and whatever. Because of this I am not part of any friend group and never get invited to take part in social gatherings. I've been trying to make a sort of Renaissance to my social life but because of my past this insecurity is a pretty strong one and has been holding me back."
Talking about yourself too much
"Call me crazy, but I never understood what's wrong with laughing at your own jokes. It takes a lot for me to get a good laugh, and if I think of something so hilarious that I literally laugh out loud (Which is rare) then you know Imma give myself a pat on the back.   On the flipside, I've been in groups where someone tells a stupid joke and they're the only ones laughing, but after a minute their laughter gets around to everyone else and it takes the situation from awkward to hilarious! So idk, I think being able to get a *genuine* laugh out of your own jokes is highly underrated"
"Not always. Sometimes, it’s about having depression. Your mind jumps to conclusions and sees the negative in everything. You don’t even realize it. I was like that for a lonnnng time before I got treatment a few years back."

"Oh yeah? Well My Dad and I hung out with a guy for a while who was the absolutely emperor of one upping people.   It got to the point where we would make up slightly unbelievable stories to see how he would one-up them.   Here’s some of the gems he presented us: His father financed and was champion of an underground street fighting league with a platinum leg; he once watched a man get hit in the face with 3 severed penis'; and he shot a metal target 100 yards away, blindfolded, judging its location from the smell of someone else shooting the target.  Clarification on the flying dick: So, he claimed to have been an EMT for a his whole life (which didn't seem possible with the timeline of his life, but that's beside the point), and he drew a lot of his stories from his 'EMT days'. One day, he says, he's working with a guy who's been an EMT for thirty years. They get a call about some domestic violence, so they head to the house where the police are already inside. Our friend says he stepped into the house ahead of the veteran EMT, and he was greeted by a screaming woman waving several severed penis' at the two police officers already inside. As soon as she saw him she hurled the cocks right at his head, and he ducked out of the way. The airborne penis' flew through the threshold of the door, striking his EMT partner in the face. The man looked down at the bloody dick on the ground, looked up at our friend, the police, and the still screaming woman, threw up his hands and yelled ""That's it, I fucking quit!"" and turned around and walked off. He said he never saw him again."

"Usually because (ironically) the stereotype is that women who have mostly male friends tend more to announce it more prevalently as a way to ingratiate themselves with men. ""I'm not like other girls guys, I'm a cool girl that is NOT into drama and other annoying feeemale things. Im into all the things you're into!!"".   See cool girl speech from gone girl for a more broken somewhat self aware version. There seems to be an expectation from women to be ""easy"" while they simultaneously acknowledge how much work other women supposedly are.   I'm sure your male friendships are very genuine and not based on this dynamic, but you do integrate a part of stereotyping and dismissing women and their friendships as work *because* of your assumptions about gender so... you don't really not fit into this crowd either? There are a great many women who enjoy simplicity and straightforwardness in their relationships that find other women like this to build friendships with, or women who simply have the flexibility to enjoy different personality types.    I have occasionally seen men do this as well though when they talk about majority female relationships, not taking into account certain intersectionality, etc."

Refusing to teach some once for fear of replacement is ridiculous.  I gave Jenner's if you create a niche job only you can do you will get stuck in the position.  By training everyone to be able and do my job simply opens up more doors foor me to move up and directly takes on a bit of my work load.
Putting others down. Especially over trivial things.   Just commented on a post about this.

"I dont like how some people act like they arent capable of bad things. People who genuinly think they cant harm anyone wont realize what they are doing wrong, because in their eyes they are good by nature, and so everything they do has to be good.  &amp;#x200B;  This creates a mentality of imcredible ignorance where they will argue over the most stupid things. I had a friend like this who was sure that insulting his brother for his enthusiasm was a good thing, because it was ""cringy"" and it will help him later in life not to be an outcast. Its bad enough to get shut down if you are happy about something, but if you are yelled at, and insulted by your own brother for it, i cant imagine how that must feel. Sure he had a point, but when i told him he should approach him in a calmer and kinder way, he was conviced that screaming was more effective, and had no negative effects on him.  And just to clarify, my friend was 18 and his brother was 10.  &amp;#x200B;  Idk how to make people more concious about their own behavior when they are conviced that they areent capable of beeing an ass."

When a person Hass to tell you how great they are either in general or at something specific. And example of this would be a certain person in my life who was always telling me he was much better at playing music than I was and putting me down. He would do this in front of people as well. To me that was a real indication of that person’s need for praise and a feeling of being better than someone rather than just to pay a simple complement
People who are too hung up on what the fuck other people got going on.
I used to have a coworker who CONSTANTLY made weird shaming comments about my body anytime all of us would go drinks after work. She once told me that she couldn’t believe that I was wearing American Apparel jeans in her and another coworkers presence ( cause they didn’t carry their sizes). She saw my nipples poking through a shirt once and bullied me about that.  Another time she called me “ fake black” cause I watch anime.  The crazy part was 99% time it was COMPLETELY unprovoked. I’d just be staring off in space and she’d hit me with a “ you really are an ungrateful bitch”.

"Honestly, there's no easy solution to this other than training your brain to break that habit. I think the first step is to get rid of the idea that there is some sort of ""snap of your fingers"" solution will come find you or vice versa. There isn't. Not saying that you think there is, but more of a general comment.  Since this likely occurs as second nature (i.e. you're not conscious of going down this thought rabbit-hole), my suggestion would first be to practice identifying your triggers and consciously make an effort to stop yourself when you've realized you're about to go down that path.  It'll likely take a few months of repeated, and failed attempts but consistency is really key here."

"There's a girl I used to be in a work group with. We befriended each other on Facebook before actually meeting. She looked beautiful, but she posted selfies constantly and there was a lot of humble bragging. I just thought she was really proud of herself because she was apparently not cute in high school.  When I met her in real life I didn't recognize her. Every single photo was posed to hide her double chin, and any body photo was taken multiple times so she could fake a curvy body. Every meeting she would be taking selfies the entire time. She would be late to things because she was taking selfies or pictures of her outfit. When we had to stay in a hotel she asked if she could try on my swimsuit. I let her, but she got upset when I wouldn't let her wear it to the pool. She would try on my clothes and be like ""We're the same size!"" Even though she was barely squeezing into things. If anyone gives her a compliment she has to post about it. She also likes to act like people have done are said horrible things to her to get pity. She'll self roast in hopes that people tell her otherwise. She constantly talks about being bisexual and I don't believe for a second that she's bi, it just fits in the persona she's created. She went on one date with a girl, took 200 pictures, then never talked to that girl again. She just needed to show her peers that she went on a date with a woman. She keeps adopting animals that she doesn't properly care for, but they look cool on Instagram.   I hate this girl. A lot of it is sad and I think she's actually a cool person beneath the bullshit, but the persona that she has obsessively built and maintained is horrible if you know her in real life. She is the most desperate person I will ever know."

"I was just pointing out that it screams insecurity, that's all. No need to get over anything"
"I absolutely hate myself but have never understood why there are people like that who feel a need to try and bring others down to their level. I take some small solace in the fact that I'm apparently not one of these toxic insecure people who throw infinite shade at people they think aren't. I think there may have been times when I was perceived to be doing it by other parties, judging by their reactions to me. But, mainly, when I get ousted for being insecure, it's because I'm so down on myself that people get sick of hearing it."
"I'd say a little bit. It's kinda fishing for compliments or it's forcing the other person to accept a negative trait about you via compassion. I'd try and stop it. Or I may be way off, you'd need to give a specific example."
"Btw not justifying what they did, but thaf is a common side affect of a mental condition like ADHD, and it's hard for the people to control themselves when they have it, but that doesn't excuse them from doing it."
"Ah, that's not what this reply made it look like."
"Are you me, did I sleep answer this?"
Being in denial of or questioning other people's success.
"Wow, would you mind getting that Nondescript Object off the top shelf for me? 'Cause you have one hell of a reach, my friend.  If I sound like a boomer, you sound like someone who thinks being loud equals being fun. It's not that deep, I just happen to enjoy my eardsrums un-perforated."

"No formatting, simply copypaste. It's not like I could please you anyway. If I just say Trump's insecure you would blame me for not giving proof. If I give proof you say it's a waste. It seems as if the only acceptable answer to you is to not criticize Trump at all"
"I don't know why, but just imagining that somehow pisses me off."
Sounds like Shanann Watts. Look what happened to her.
"Someone who screams ""I'm very insecure""."

"&gt;Wow, would you mind getting that Nondescript Object off the top shelf for me? 'Cause you have one hell of a reach, my friend.  So, by that logic everything you're saying is one hell of a reach? Because I have just as much actual knowledge as you.  &gt;If I sound like a boomer, you sound like someone who thinks being loud equals being fun. It's not that deep, I just happen to enjoy my eardsrums un-perforated.  Again where's your evidence? I acknowledge that things which are obnoxiously loud are annoying. I just doubt we agree what obnoxious means. No one is puncturing your ear drums while you're in your house, snowflake."

Geez are you 14? Adults can control themselves and also aren't obsessed with having sex all the time.

"The other day I was on a job site and I told a guy that I just bought this new three-piece Milwaukee set ..it was new for me 350 bucks...asshole on the job site like oh yeah you think that's not that I just been $1,000 on my set... I immediately forfeited and gave him the win.."

"Yeah, sorry, I have awful internet service here!"
That’s not how they do it in Narnia.
"I'm dealing with that myself right now. Took me years to react and notice it. Always thought there was something wrong with me.  Besides... she (gf that is doing this to me - knowingly or unknowingly) blew me on our first date... should have taken a hint about insecurity... but that was ages ago and I just figured I got lucky.  But she is still great, and we are both working through our issues hoping to fix the relationship. All issues aside... we can't just get enough of ourselves.  It's a tough one."
"Position compromised, going dark"
"I wouldn't really call it control over it when it initially isn't you who put you into this place called depression. It's the result of our culture/society and you don't really have control over that. You don't control if you fall into it or not in the first place.  It's like swiming upstream as a fish. Sure it's possible, but you don't have full control over it. You can't control the currents of the stream and can only try to give it your all to swim up. Whether that's enough or not is just sheer luck."
"""oh you wanna defend your other friend instead of me it was always her over me anyways"" Bitch..."
"I had a girl at work, who I actually knew in 8th grade and was kinda excited to talk with after not seeing her in a while, tell me to my face I was weird for liking video games (and anime back in 8th grade, which was incorrect) and insinuate I was mentally ill because I made a couple mistakes with customers after cashiering for almost 8 hours straight. I asked her what she liked and it was typical redneck shit (""Hunting, trucking, and mudding"" she said)."
"Fyi, if you ever need to call somewhere on a loaded network, theres a way to drop your phone to only 3g. Its a completely different frequency from 4g, and will most likely not be crowded. Id suggest googling how to do it with your specific type of phone."
"Painful handshakes. If you need to hold on that tight, you're insecure about plenty of somethings."
"Can confirm. Busted my ass way too hard in high school, got into a top 15 college, went there,  the stress finally caught up with me, and I proceeded to implode like a dying star.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm good now but if I'd just gone easier on myself when I was in HS, I probably would've graduated this year. Instead I dropped out and I'm writing this from a glorified call center. Oh well, c'est la vie."

Haha I definitely know what you're talking about. I read a lot of those and makes me not super surprised how often people get divorced.
People who post stuff on twitter and snap basically begging other people to give their opinions on the poster.
Trying to dominate conversations (not to be confused with just being a charismatic person).
"i do this, but nobody denies it they just start laughing"
Not being able to be by yourself for a while. Going straight into new relationships after you have just ended one.
"The way you wrote this makes me laugh so hard, thank you :)"
Don't think that stops with age. Or it stops because they actually adapt the views they express...
This just became a gold mine for describing people you hate.
What if I put my bed next to yours on our minecraft server?
Did you read OP’s question? Owning and talking about a gun doesn’t make someone insecure. Whether anyone cares or not is another question.
"I find myself doing this alot, it's not insecurity alone (altough i won't say it doesn't play a part) I'm just very competitive. Even when I don't want to be."

"The other day a Facebook friend posted, “No I’m not engaged anymore. No I’m not okay. No I don’t want to talk about it.” Soooo why the fuck did you post a status about it? If you don’t wanna talk about it, keep that shit off of social media.   By the way it’s been less than a week and she’s back together with him (who cheated) “trying to work it out.”"
"Ended up having a great day, thanks for taking the time out. Knowing somebody out there is willing means more than you know. Have a good one man."
"Oh you mean the left side of the wardrobe, on the other side of Nunnia?"
My uncle was like this. And if anyone dare disagree it instantly became a heated debate.   Guy believed that women who take the contraceptive pill were aborting one child every month. Also called his niece a skank because she had recently become a woman and began her period and apparently she wasn’t sitting correctly for a woman. He was absolutely nuts
I have something very special for you: 🔑
"Hey, thanks for that. You know what? I'm going to take you up on it. Recently got discord again so I guess it's a sign.   Again, thanks for the words. These little things are what help me realise the world is actually pretty cool when your heads in a better place.   Love you guys."
"Except he said “Nope just Trump Supporters.” Implying that all trump supporters are nazis. He didn’t say some trump supporters, he didn’t say a few, he implied that all trump supporters are nazis. This is not a mischaracterization of what he said. He’s implying that everyone that disagrees with him on political issues is a nazi."
Why would you do that though?! I think you’re great.

"Some solid advice, from a stranger.  There are indeed good folks out there, I just gotta get off my ass and meet them.   You're especially awesome for taking the time out to cheer someone up.  This shit means a lot to me on a deep level.   Proud of you too, dude."
Best remedy is to disagree with yourself verbally out loud. I don’t degrade myself to others but definitely call myself names eg. I’m SUCH an idiot. Now I say “oops no I’m not an idiot”

A person screaming “I’m very insecure”
"1) Cutting your dick off and thinking you are a girl is a mental illness.   2.) Gender Dysphoria is actually labeled as a mental illness in the DSM-5.   3.) Donald Trump is the exact opposite of a facist. He’s the worst facist I’ve ever seen considering he wants to arm his citizens so they can fight a tyrannical government.  4.) Yeah dude imagine saying “Man I wish that dude got fired.”  5.) And no, I’m not saying that it’s moral as long as it’s legal. Like homosexuality is legal, which is fine, it’s in their right to be homosexual, but I still find it immoral. The thing is you people have no legitimate reason to hate the president. All your arguments are intellectually lazy and always boils down to “he hurt my feelings!”"
"Any idea how to fix that  EDIT: And I mean, how does that even work? Aren't ""goody two shoes"" and ""asshole"" two completely opposed concepts? See this is the type of shit I don't even understand man"

Too much makeup
"Had a ""friend"" (we are no longer friends) who would say stuff like, ""It's just like... Hard to find other smart and thoughtful people like us, huh?"" Please leave me out of this...   He cheated on his girlfriend and lied to me about it. She literally sent me the text messages he was sending this other girl every day. It made me irrationally angry because I've told him how much exes have destroyed my emotions by doing this, and for a good two months before this happened he was telling me how ""paranoid"" his girlfriend was being. When I asked him about the cheating he said she's ""Probably on that time of the month, you know?"" and said he and this other woman were just friends. I'm a woman. This was months ago and I'm still mad about it."

My friend posts a photo of his thermometer every time he gets a fever. Why would anyone care?
"I have some sad/extreme stories too. So it’s hard to get those into conversation without seeming like I have a victims mentality. I don’t! I can’t stand that attitude and I am fiercely independent and determined. But I need to talk about stuff! It’s a good idea to find a few ppl who you know will not judge you, and that you know love you and just stick to sharing with them. Others don’t need to know the depth of things. I often get irritated by small talk and find it hard to converse at first because I have to “cover it up” but I always have 3 women I know I can honestly talk to, that love me and know me well. &lt;3   Edit, and yes I find it hard to make eye contact also apart from when I’m listening. I can’t do it well when I’m talking. I often stare above their head or at the floor. But when I listen I find it easier. I really much prefer to listen."

Even if it's hella common it's good for people to be able to recognize these habits in themselves.   I'll admit to being a pretty insecure person but I've gotten better over the past few years because  I've been paying attention to things I do (like this list) and working on changing them.
That's awesome; never get rid of it.
There's nothing wrong with that if it makes you feel more at ease

Humble-~~B~~ ragging.
"That last part is what I was referring to, because there's generally an acceptable loudness for vehicles. Like there's a major difference between what you did and buying a fart can or straight-piping a car. I wasn't being too specific about that... Though the OP was talking about a lemon car, and straight-piping something like a Dodge Neon doesn't help it that much.  And I didn't know people straight-piped Harleyss, aren't they already fairly loud in the stock configuration?"
"I dont participate in social media,because my opinion doesnt matter and I cant do anything about it ,so I concentrate on what I can change."
Yeah I'm quite a perfectionist and I always worry people are going to think I'm fishing for compliments
Insulting people they aren't friends with every chance they get
Why is that? Couldn’t you just leave if you’re unhappy?

"There are a lot of signs. Some of the most common i have experienced are:  1. Always bragging about even the smallest achievements in your life 2. Overinflating the importance of anything you do 3. Always assuming bad intentions from everyone 4. Never admitting your own mistakes, always blaming someone or something else 5. the need to forcefully dominate conversations, like often interrupting people out of nowhere"

"Yes, he was saying all Trump supporters are nazis (which I disagree with) but people can presumably disagree with him politically without being Trump supporters. It's not about whether they disagree with him, it's about whether they support Trump specifically."

"I do that, but my wife doesnt have an issue with it, because she knows my history. My mother abandoned me when I was 12, my father died in my arms when I was 16, I couldnt make or keep friends to save my life due to me being extremely socially awkward because my mother used to LITERALLY cage me and cut off contact to the outside world. I have abandonment issues, amongst hyper vigilance, which cursed me.  On top of that, I had a cousin who was kidnapped, and she was found dead, stuffed in an oil drum, weeks later. I had a female friend who still hasnt been found, and the only lead on her was her photo being spotted on a sex trafficking website, by the FBI. And unbeknownst to me, the city I just moved my daughters and wife to, has a huge sex traffic highway from it. My PTSD due to intense childhood trauma doesnt help it  So Im not like overwhelming with it, but I do check her location from time to time when shes out with friends. Im trying to protect her."

My Dr said ""man to man, get a new job"" and proceeded to give me a life lesson... Though I still don't know how to just get another job. My job is primarily the problem with my body. It's slowly destroying me physically. My left hand started giving out last Friday and I spent all weekend off playing difficult games just to make sure I could still use them fully.

Awkward Silence
"My sister and my cousin are almost two years apart (She’s turned three this year and he’s turning five). Every time I y’all about something good that my sister has done, my Aunty tries to diminish it? Or just kinda make it seem like it isn’t important at all. For example:  “Yeah. Michelle is fully potty trained, so you don’t have to put a diaper on her anymore.”  “Okay. Her using the bathroom and not wetting the bed for a few days isn’t potty ‘trained’.”  “She hasn’t wet the bed in a month now. She’s fully potty trained. Just don’t put the diaper on her please, because it’s going to set her back and she’ll feel like it’s okay to pee in the bed at night.”  “Why are you potty training a one-year-old anyway? *Says this part in a sing songy way* Chiiiild abuseeee.”   She does shit like that to make it seem like a ‘joke’ and then she laughs at me. In that instance, I really just wanted her to stop suggesting to and putting diapers on my sister.  She also tries to make me feel bad for taking care of my baby sister. Calling my mother lazy, a child abuser, calling me a slave etc. If she seems I’m in the process of caring for her, she would tell me to stop, tell me to let my mummy do it or throw jeers at me while I’m doing it and comment on how I’m ‘Insecure that your mother doesn’t like you so you’re just trying to get her attention’.  She does this because her daughter doesn’t help out with her son as much as I help out with my sister. I try to hold my tongue and ‘respect my eldersss’ but she just constantly hurts my feelings."

She was even doing it when she said that to me with her loud and hateful tone. She said that a meal I cooked recently sucked even though I have been making it the exact same way for years and everyone else loves it. I have never in my life said a meal she made was anything less than good even if it was. Considering she burns biscuits 9 times ouf of 10, that happened pretty often."

"Hey, I do this. Or at least, I used to. I’m incredibly insecure and unhappy with myself. When I realized what I was doing, I started to try to reverse it. When I walk into a room, no matter who’s in it,  force myself to think of three nice things about them. If I haven’t met them yet, I pull out their three nicest features. Their smile, their outfit etc. I wouldn’t say this out loud. It just helps me to act more positively towards people."

Feminism
"Men are being told to suck it up and stigmatized if they report rape or abuse - it's toxic masculinity's fault.   Women are being told they shouldn't be engineers and to pursue more feminine professions, or are the perpetrators of abuse towards men and it gets ignored because they're female - it's also...toxic masculinity's fault?   Like WTF seriously? How is it not obvious? What a world we live in lol"
What does it mean?
"I don't think it is, I've been doing this to myself long before Reddit. And a few times to others as well. It's never with ill intent, but I do look like a total dick every time  But, people in real life should care more, I learned a lot about differentiating between words in therapy. There's absolutely nitpicky people who call you out for _""liking""_  a movie instead of _""loving""_  it, but other differences can be important. I just wrote this whole paragraph of examples, but I don't want to write (any more of) a wall of text. ^((this song even came on that fits that idea and further convinced me to trim it down a ton)^)  I hope I'm not looking like that exact redditor now, but I can't help myself, some types of words aren't as unimportant &amp; it has helped me so much to nitpick about my own words and others' due to advice from therapists. I hope none of this sounds condescending, I'm beginning to fear that it comes across that way, sorry if it did"

"Re: potty training, ""day trained"" is absolutely a thing, because not wetting when asleep is a very different physiological mechanism than not doing it awake.

I absolutely get that the competition is annoying and it *is* insecurity, but when you're in the midst of it, it gets a lot more understandable, imo. It can get out of hand, but if it's on the ""I'm worried and need reassurance once in a while"" side of the line (rather than the ""I'm the best and anybody who's not doing it exactly like I am sucks"" side) I'd try to err on the side of compassion."

"&gt; I don't think I'd have worded it the way OP did (""you're not really building a relationship with them""  That was the basis of my post. Children are an interesting topic because it’s something everyone has varying levels of exposure to, but most need at least a little guidance on how to treat, talk, or deal with them. Except no one wants to admit that fact and takes offense to any information they didn’t find on their own.   &gt; you are laying the foundation for the relationship being built, but you get very very little evidence of the results of that effort until they're older.  Children start understanding tone, words, expressions, and mannerisms as young as 8-10 months old. Even younger, but you start seeing their responses at this age. They absolutely have bonds, are able to understand security, and are very in tuned to what trusted caregivers are doing, saying, and feeling. [This video displays that very well.](https://youtu.be/p6cqNhHrMJA)   Though I don’t like the term wrangling, that is not what I was encouraging the op to reframe their thinking on. Infants and toddlers absolutely need a fair amount of redirection, but they are very capable of understanding. Older infants and toddlers are simply trying to understand the level of power they have in the world. This is why they are always trying to find the boundary. Much like the bumpers in bowling a caregivers job is helping them find that line, and directing them down the correct path."

"My husband and I have the life360 apps on our phones. I stay home with our kids and he works on the road doing home security. He has no set time to get home at night, and isn't allowed to use his personal phone during the work day, or any phone in his work truck or in front of his customer. So the times during the day that I'd be able to get in touch with him are limited or non-existent. Having the app lets me know how far away he is working and how long his drive home is, so I can plan our dinner and if I can keep the kids up for a few extra minutes at bedtime so he can have goodnight kisses. If it gets close to dinner and I can see he isn't on his way home yet I know I can wrap up his dinner and put the kids to bed, and I don't have to blow up his phone to get an eta and get him in trouble. He drives up to 2.5 hours in any direction and the amount of time on the road worries me sometimes, he could wreck at any time, and the app would tell me if he is stuck somewhere on the road for too long. Aside from him being at work, we don't use the app to check up on each other."

"How? Public transportation is slower. It's always making stops which can last from 2 seconds to sometimes a minute or more. The trains are always prone to delays because of track maintenance and other trains taking too long to keep it moving. The trackers arent always accurate, sometimes theres 20 minute gaps in between buses and if you miss 1 then you're fucked. Not to mention that the farther your destination, the wider the gap in arrival time for public transportation compared to cars. I don't want to have an hour+ commute when I can wait to get a car and cut it down by more that half. And don't even get me started on the poor hygiene of it all.  It's not a bad excuse at all. If you live in a city, especially chicago, and take buses/trains you would understand."

"Look past the goddamn terminology. It can be called ""hitler's a very nice guy"" for all that matters. The fact is is that both men and women are, even unconsciously, held to toxic stereotypes. For men, that particular stereotype is that men are more dangerous, and always the abuser. This has the flip side of depicting women as weak, and the abused. The mindset helps no one, and I honestly don't know if you're rejecting the idea that it exists, or if you are so shallow that you cannot get past the technical terminology for it"

"Wearing a lot of baggy clothing and high waisted jeans. Along with when someone doesn’t respond to a message they have to talk trash about them because they are worried about loosing them. Also when it comes to a relationship you always are with her/him and that’s all you talk about. You’re also always with them because you are scared of loosing them and fear a break up. Another thing that screams I’m very insecure is, constantly worrying about what others think and looking around you constantly to make sure you aren’t doing anything wrong. Very nervous about it all."
Just because you personally define a reason as hateful doesn’t mean that whoever uses it must hate people who are homosexual though. That’s the point.

You should always listen to feedback though as it make make you aware of something you may not have noticed before.  I also think there is a difference between being an asshole and tough love.

He also looked slightly downward instead of making eye contact with me even though I’m taller than him. He seems like a nice guy, but he’s always quiet and seems to act super uneasy around me.

Some things that might make us seem insecure but it's our ADHD showing is; dominating a conversation which is most likely us interrupting on accident because we are so excited to tell you our thoughts, making one topic seem incredibly important which is us hyper focusing, hyper focusing makes some of us seem dramatic but our thoughts are like tree branches, once we think of an issue we want to know every possible outcome. We can seem to try to be one upping you but it's the branch thing happening again, your story reminded us of five of our own and we don't want to compete we just want to share our thoughts. I promise, people with ADHD often notice right after we do something that isn't deemed acceptable, but we are trying. I'm sure there's plenty I'm forgetting."

"That’s not how this works. You don’t get to use whatever terms you want and put whatever definition you want with them. In fact your strong desire to keep this terminology in tact is more revealing of your motives.  Or I’ll just start replacing “toxic masculinity” with “women are cunts”. It’s just terminology, who cares? Feminism is now “bitches being bitches”. Upset? Just look past the terminology, that’s not what matters.  You agree both men and women are, in cases, held to toxic stereotypes. Yet you want that all to be handled under a gendered term directed at males. This just brings me back to my original point of why this term was made in the first place.  Notice the only way to reveal that “toxic masculinity” also supposedly has something to do with negative female behavior is to call it out as sexist and have a multi-comment chain discussion over it that most people won’t read. If I hadn’t said anything, it would just continue to pass as “toxic masculinity” - a literal translation of “poisonous attributes general attributes to men”.  In a conversation about an emotionally abusive girl, you’re using a term that directly translates into the *man* having poisonous traits.   It takes true double-think to somehow make this not a sexist term without an appropriate female counter. If you want to talk about toxic masculinity, start talking about toxic femininity too. Then when conversations about psycho women in relationships comes around, you can use the right term instead of trying to deflect everything onto men.  And then you get to watch the ~~feminist~~ bitch hive mind reject the new term as sexist."

"Jesus christ man who hurt you?  I'm not just ""putting whatever definition I want"" to the terminology. That is the definition. Toxic masculinity is called so, not because men are toxic, but because the masculine ideal that all men are expected to conform to is toxic, you thick bastard. And I never have said, nor will say, that me being abused is anything but the fault of my ex. I said, if you care to actually read my words, that the fact it was not called out, even though it was very public and obvious, was because of this toxic masculinity. That's not blaming me, that's not blaming men, thats explaining the difference between treatment of abuse through the fact that men are held to a destructive standard where they are seen as ""rapists in waiting"", ""abusers"", and any littany of horrible judgments.  Do some goddamn research before wasting my time and hating feminists.  Edit: BTW, this is exactly the point ""Big Red"" was trying to get through to people.

Unusual voice changes (usually higher pitch), stuttering, nervous swallowing, excessive blinking, tics and twitches. Sweating. Trembling. Incoherent speech, mumbling. Inability to perform at one's best. Choking. Unnecessary aggression - usually sign of weakness and insecurity. Difficulty in expressing love and affection.      If you are in such place right now, don't worry. All people have been there and many of them are there at the moment. Especially on the Internet. You are not alone.

"Do these people stand up to you when you act that way? Or they just let you have the last word and let you be?  If it's the latter, then that's the major reason why you are the way you are. It's because you never had people disagree with you and stand up to you when disagreements happen.  The best thing you yourself can do is be aware of yourself and your way of thinking. Otherwise the actual best thing to happen is to have people who care about you stand up to you when you start acting irrationally and for them to tell you that you're being irrational and hopefully snap you out of it every time it happens.

"You can’t even argue your side without degenerating into personal attacks. Sorry calling out your sexism is getting you so mad. Maybe just don’t be sexist next time.  It’s simple. You have toxic behavior from both men and women, and a term describing it that  uses a gendered term aimed specifically at one sex only.  You can’t defend that without being sexist.   You’re literally saying a male victim of abuse exists because of “toxic masculinity.” Just disgusting.  The idea that men are “rapists in waiting” largely comes from women - gets labeled “toxic masculinity”. Disgusting.  You see masculinity as toxic because you are sexist. Most men have masculine traits and you just said  &gt;	the masculine ideal that all men are expected to conform to is toxic  How more clear does it need to be? You are saying men are toxic for being men. This is directly implying masculinity = bad, therefore the opposite (femininity) = good.  You are just sexist. At this point it is clear there is no way you will be willing to see this. If this conversation is such a waste of time then just stop replying. You clearly don’t care if you are being sexist, you just want to be right.  Or keep spewing the abundance of sexism you seem to harbor."
"I knew you were going to go there. I fucking *knew* it. Of course they deserve to be forever alone. But that's not what it's like to be in the situation.   They seem perfectly nice at first. Them getting angry at you occasionally is just brushed off, after all, I was in the wrong. But you seem to always be doing something wrong. They gradually get more and more angry, as your self esteem gets lower and lower. They criticize everything, they find every button. It keeps getting worse and worse. Now you're apparently lying to them, you don't love them enough. Your self esteem is now so low that you begin cutting yourself off from your friends, after all, I'm worthless, they don't want me around. All you want is the tiniest amount of positivity you can get from your abuser. It keeps getting worse. I am worthless. You get the tiniest sliver of basic human decency from them, and it keeps you going for a week, after all, it's all you deserve. It only ends when either they get bored of you or you reach a breaking point. It ended for me when I was apparently saying hello the wrong way. But it still sticks with you after it's over. You don't suddenly stop thinking you're worthless, now you think you're worthless and no one loves you, nor will they ever. The initial joy of leaving the situation is short lived. You feel isolated, alone, and the only other person you just lost. You regret it, you just want to go back, you just need someone. You only remember the happiness you felt, and it's deafening absence. You continue spiraling down. It's only once you realise that your thoughts are consumed with killing yourself that you realise that you need help. You've apparently had a complete emotional breakdown, and your depression, anxiety, and stress are all in the ""extremely severe"" category. The only way you get out of this hole is real friends, medication, therapy, and a fucking long time.  You can't just leave. You're worthless, remember?"

If someone is depressed and constantly belittled about their apperance and they binge eat because of it. Trust me, being an asshole won't fix the root of the problem.   The main motivation for weight loss is almost always health. Not because of you. Get off your high horse and realize you are useless to people who need help."

"Screaming ""IM VERY INSECURE """
That's true. The ability to understand intentions has a lot of benefit when it comes to understanding why someone else may have done something that didn't end well. It makes it a lot easier to forgive minor offenses.  Understanding the importance of actions over intentions is more useful during self reflection to understand where you may be going wrong.
"I'm a naturally insecure 20-something and have mostly overcome my insecure tendencies, but having lived a life not really telling stories about myself, or driving conversation at all, makes me really bad at it. I find myself getting interrupted by tangents a lot. I think it's just because I must not speak in a compelling way. I'm usually comfortable bringing the conversation back eventually just to finish whatever I wanted to say, but sometimes it just isn't worth it. In groups of 5 or more friends I usually don't even bother and stick to making quick jokes or whatever other small contribution so I don't have to worry about being interrupted before I can get to the point."

"Ok I am gonna break this down nice and easy for you:  1. I am mad because you seem to hold an unwarranted hate for either women or feminists 2. Toxic masculinity does not refer to specific individuals, or their specific toxic behavior. It refers to toxic ideals men are held to 3. I am not sexist. I believe that the issues facing men (like myself) are just as valid as any facing women, and we need to fight against them (like feminists have been for decades) 4. I don't even know where you got ""You’re literally saying a male victim of abuse exists because of “toxic masculinity.” Just disgusting"" from. I did not blame my abuse on toxic masculinity. It is 100%, unequivocally my ex. I blame the double standard of the calling out of abuse on toxic masculinity 5. This idea does not ""largely come from women"". If it was why do I see so many dads worried their daughter is gonna get raped? Why do I see both men and women laughing at male rape? This stereotype comes from the societal expectation that all men want is sex. That falls under toxic masculinity. 6. Men can be as buff as they want, love sports as much as they want, love wrestling, and anything else manly you can think of, but expecting all men to be like that is toxic. But more importantly there are implicit stereotypes of men. Believing all men want is sex is toxic and minimizes male rape. Believing all men are violent minimizes physical abuse against them. Believing all men are emotional rocks minimizes emotional abuse.   The societal beliefs that oppress women and men are just two sides of the same coin. One comes from the other, and neither are the fault of the gender."

"Always weigh out the pros and cons of your relationship. As cliché as it sounds, if your cons outweigh your pros then its time to have self control and make the tough decision to pack it up.   Choices sometimes cause pain on both sides of the relationship but if its ultimately for the better (for you) then its needed.   Dont stick around because of you being together for such a long time. Stick around because you benefit from each other. Dont let someone emotionally abuse you for years and think its okay because youre going to keep doubting yourself and shes going to keep gaslighting until youre old, hateful and resentful for wasting your life with someone whos shrill and mean and abusive.   Trust me ive been there and made those tough decisions to walk away. And yeah i was sad for a couple months and felt lonely but ive found myself, my confidence and im working on my happiness still and i believe its important to pass those lessons on. Sometimes its better to let go of an okay relationship to work on yourself and find that amazing relationship.   Fights should usually only happen when one person isnt doing something good for themselves and sometimes others. Not whenever the other person feels like theyre right. Which for an abuser is usually always. They never compromise  Edit: added a bit for clarity"

Actually, he's kind of an encyclopaedia in general. Haha. Which makes talking to him very enjoyable. Whereas I take simple pleasure in the things I enjoy. I actually am better at analysing than recalling trivia so I usually take an analytical approach to conversation whereas he comes with the facts. Makes for interesting conversation but I'm limited to more abstract topics because I can't stay grounded enough for purely logic based topics.  And same with love in general.

It's just that we are both heavily damaged goods and we are working through it.  Also...

"I used to watch NY1 a lot before I went to work or at the gym.  I didn't exactly think of the newscasters as friends, but I was concerned about them when they went off the air for whatever reason, usually because they got married or had a kid.  I'd be relieved to hear that's why.  And I was glad Roma Torre beat colon cancer.       I live work in the NYC area and had friends/co-workers/relatives in the area downtown on 9/11.  I was more worried about them when the towers went down, but I was also relieved to see the newscasters covering it back on the air after fleeing.  Partially because I figured, based on locations, if they were ok, the people I knew were ok too.  But I did feel some relief for them too.  It felt a little odd because it's not like I really know them or anything.       I wouldn't stalk them or anything though."

"I am so glad that by the time my nephew was born, my parents were completely over this. Looking back, they were definitely like this with me--I'm the middle child so I don't know how they acted with my older brother, or really remember how they were with my younger sister.   They have been raising my nephew since he was born 14 years ago, there's almost a 20 year age gap between my nephew and I so I witnessed a lot of great parenting. They were so relaxed. Little J is almost 4 and not potty trained? ""He knows what to do, when he wants to, he'll go in the potty."" J still insists on a baby bottle of milk before bed? ""Eventually he won't want it."" Etc... no competition whatsoever. In today's world, that's really refreshing. I hope I'm like that when I'm a parent,  myself."

Or I will be communicating to you that I need help. Or we are having sex and I’m trying to figure out if something I’m trying is working for you.

"Keep that adamant defense for sexism going. It’s ironic because hyper liberals are all about changing terminology to protect their feelings.  We’re just back to the “you’re sexist and won’t admit it” part.  Like, nothing would be stopping you from using a different term. But then you would have to stop being sexist.   It’s clear your goal is to just find a defense to your sexism so you don’t feel like a piece of shit for being sexist, like most sexists should."

"2) and 'in' pretty sure you're a degenerate without any understanding of what you're talking about. He didn't ban people who had gender dysphoria he banned trans people.  3) No I'm acting like the fact that black people who legally carry are at risk of state violence is one of the biggest affronts to the second amendment, and your claim that trump 'arm his citizens so they can fight a tyrannical government' are unfounded based on both this **AND** the fact that he has also banned certain firearm sales.   I could also bring up the fact that the times trump has talked about citizens fighting the government, it has only been in reference to his political opponents, another characterization of fascism.  4.)Yep a person **who is the president** expressing an opinion **,using his office,** **that people exercising first amendment right should be fired**, what a tragedy.  5) I'm using the definitions provided by historians, they tend to be more comprehensive than Merriam fucking Webster, anyone with an ounce of intelligence knows that the dictionary isn't a sufficient source for any conversation that goes beyond grammar and pronunciation. The irony is even by the webster dictionary my evidence would point to my position being correct.  edit: also you forgot this bit from your dictionary source   &gt;: a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control  edit edit: I also specifically asked at the beginning of this thread if it was my definition of fascism that was the issue. Interesting that you waited until now to bring it up.  Also interesting that your points of contention have slowly dropped off to the point where your only arguments are:  1)trans people are mentally ill (they're not) and therefore should be banned unilaterally by the president from service 2)He protects the right to bear arms (which wouldn't preclude him from being a fascist) and his failure to protect minorities' second amendment rights, and banning firearm sales isn't evidence that he doesn't  3)Calling for the firing of people who exercise first amendment rights isn't fascistic or authoritarian 4)I'm retarded because you only use ~~meriam webster to understand political philosophies~~ specific definitions from meriam webster to understand political philosophies"

"Wow you're going all out on Fashun.  Do people forget that women and men have differences? They're definitely more alike than different, but they still do differ in certain aspects.  What Fashun is saying about women is more likely to be correct (around 60%) than false if you're aiming at all women. It doesn't make Fashun a terrible human being for stating that.  So generally speaking, Fashun isn't wrong."

"Oh, my co-parenting situation is exceptionally balanced almost all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Certainly more than it was when I was caring for my siblings. But that 25% often covered things like...I needed to go to school, and I wasn't responsible for figuring out what the babies were going to do when I was there, or how to pay for it. I often did bedtime care, but middle-of-the-night stuff was more evenly split. The 25% was often practical parts of the work, leaving me with almost all of the socio-emotional work but not all of the practical caregiving. I was alone with them \*a lot\* and it was really not a great situation, but while my feelings toward my youngest siblings are a lot more on the parental side than they were for the brother closer to my own age, there's still some sibling stuff in there, too, and it's kinda complicated.  As a parent of my own kid, the balance is different, even if overall it's better."

When a SO of a friend is compelled to answering your questions to your friend instead of letting your friend answer you on social media   2. When you see a good friend of the opposite sex and their SO proceeds to put them in a trap of their arms.   3. When someone has to one-up every story you have, or is sicker than you, or their stories are funnier than yours, etc.   4. When a guy or girl has to have a harem of girls or guys to make themselves feel like they’re sooo attractive and irresistible  5. Last one is when you say something sarcastic or funny and it’s meant to be taken lightheartedly but the smartass has to be too serious and let out the air from your funny balloon.   There is more, but these are the things that come to mind when I see “I’m insecure.”"

I guess to each their own, but I'd likely never use anything like that."

"Going out of your way to scare people makes you an asshole. Regardless of what you're using to do it. However, guns were made to kill people. Guns, when in the wrong hands, can and do kill people. It's far different to be scared of a potentially fatal shooting than being scared of, say a clown costume or halloween mask.  I don't care that you're a ""responsible gun owner""(the fact that you use your *weapon* to scare people means you clearly aren't responsible enough). As a random bystander, I don't know that. You could be safe and responsible. Or unstable and unpredictable. I have no way of knowing which you are, so I have no way of knowing whether I need to be wary of you. So I would be uncomfortable and go out of my way to avoid you.   Sure sure, open carrying means bad guys will know you're armed. But how do I know you aren't a bad guy? I don't. And I won't know until something potentially fatal happens.   I know guns don't just go off randomly. But I know what they are capable of when operated by a human being I have no reason to implicitly trust.  You've never hit a human because you've never aimed at one(I should hope you aren't someone who points a gun as a threat). But I, as an unarmed bystander, don't know if that's going to change."

Certainly no core GOP policies are opposite of Jesus' teaching.  Was it policy you thought was opposite to Christian teaching, or just individual actions?"

"I feel like I do this unintentionally, because so often during a conversation I say, ""That reminds me of when I was in Japan for a year during college, and one of my professors..."" or, ""I realized while I was playing guitar on stage one time..."" something like that.  I know not everyone travels abroad or plays music in front of people - but I don't have anywhere else to draw memories from. My life, besides that trip to Japan and college, has been largely spent sitting in front of my computer. I was even homeschooled, and have never had a job - so I can't very well draw on school or work experiences either besides college.  So... If I sound like I humble-brag when the only things I draw on for examples in conversation are Japan, music, or travel - it's not because I'm insecure, it's because it's practically the only thing I have to talk about."

These people are yelling at me for generalizing and stereotyping women and then in the same breath telling me my guy friends are only friends with me because they want to fuck me. So it’s ok to generalize and stereotype men as immature, emotionally stunted, and singularly sex driven, but got forbid you have a single negative thing to say about women."

"I'm a black and white person, and that's how it is for me. It's fine if you're a gray area person, but just because you use a gray area doesn't mean I do.  I find any kind of tracking app creepy and made for people who don't trust each other (unless in emergencies).  You see between my beliefs and are cool with having apps like that for other reasons (to you and probably many others).  That's fine. Agree to disagree I guess. I was just answering the askreddit prompt.  *shrugs*"

"Pretty much. It's also about realizing and respecting individuality. My husband is my best friend and my partner, but just because we're a team doesn't mean we're the same person. We have different likes and dislikes and if I spent every moment obsessing when he did something outside of my likes, I'd drive myself insane."
Weve all been friends for 30 years. And it's a regular thing with him. He finds shallow girls when were out. Brings them to hang out with us brags about our friend. They hit on him since hes 'rich' the girls find out hes married with a kid then my bragging friend swoops in and trys to take them home. It's a whole thing that's been going on for a while.
Are you saying it takes a Mexican 20 years to immigrate to the US but a Dane only 4 years?

"It's not my birthday, but thank you. And again, it wasn't an attack on them, only the situation and the irony of it. Poorly executed jokes/sarcasm never end well though"
Exactly. Theres irony in your commenting on a thread about people constantly talking about themselves and bringing themselves up and my comment by involving myself in other people's lives online
"No, just ask Reddit. These low-life losers never have anything good happen to them so whenever they get reminded about how pathetic they are they make up words to try to make it seem like you're the bad guy."

"Start with the easy one that's most recent.  And for your point, every major conservative in leadership considers themselves a Christian and claim to follow Jesus's teachings.    **Exodus 22:21** – Moses gives God’s law:  “You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien; for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.”  **Leviticus 19:9-10 and 23:22** – Moses gives God’s law:  “You shall not strip your vineyards bare…leave them for the poor and the alien.”  **Leviticus 19:33-34 and 24:22** – When the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien.  The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.”  **Leviticus 24:23** – Moses receives God’s law:  “With me you are but aliens and tenants.”   **Deuteronomy 6:10-13** – The people of Israel are made aware that the land had come to them as a gift from God and they were to remember that they were once aliens.  **Deuteronomy 10:18-19** – “For the Lord your God...loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.  You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”  **Deuteronomy 14:28-29 and 26:12-13** – Tithing was begun, in part, for resident aliens.   **Ezekiel 47:21-22** – The aliens shall be to you as citizens, and shall also be allotted an inheritance.   How about supporting a known philanderer in DT?     *“Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”* [Hebrews 13:4](https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Heb%2013.4).   How about supporting DT when its known that he tries to not pay his workers?    **Deuteronomy 24:14**   – “You shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other Israelites or aliens who reside in your land...”   How about economic policy like cuts to medicaid?   **Proverbs 14:31 - ""**Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God. ""   **Mark 10:25** ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.""   **Hebrews 13:5** ""Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will i leave you' never will I forsake you'.   How about voting against aid for areas affected that they don't represent but then crying about aid when its their own areas?  (You just need to google colorado republicans who voted against federal aid after Sandy but when they had flooding ran to the federal coffers).    **Mark 12:31** By the 2nd is this: ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" There is no commandment greater than these.  Shall I continue?"

Hello my name is Donald Trump
Bullying other people. Just because you're insecure doesn't mean you need to make others feel the same way.
Says the guy who was so insecure he went out of his way to find his IQ
"Uhh, yeah.    He was seriously mentally ill."
"Actually no. I was just answering the post. This is why you’re insecure. You can just accept that people have differing opinions. Instead of acceptance or opening an intellectual discourse, you attack. I would never pretend to know what it’s like to walk a mile in your shoes. But I can witness your struggles and insecurity and accompany you on our journey through life."
Someone who posts hundreds of selfies a day
me i scream it every day
"Remeber your field, its science. Retial and social jobs have these types of people. Its not wrong its just where you are and the culture behind it."
"I think its realizing that you're simultaneously not as odious as you think you are, not the center of the universe, *and* that you have some level of true value/worth helps.  (That being said I'm working on this too)."
No i mean as regular attire like wearing khakis everyday.
"I literally have rejection sensitive dysphoria. It hurts, but you just have to manage it."
What is your interpretation of the verses on immigration? Do they say to treat immigrants with dignity and respect or that the world should embrace open borders?  The verses related to hoarding wealth and treating workers well are relevant to individuals (in both parties) but not policy.  Citing the golden rule was pretty funny. Such a broad accusation.  I hope you found these verses yourself and didnt just copy/paste from a blog 🤗
"That's insecurity, my dawg."
Http://
Nothing screams I'm very insecure more than people who are only kind in front of or to people in power.
I don't read fiction so they are stuff I've maintained because this issue comes up more often than I'd like. I am an atheist and have more connection to the scripture than almost every conservative I've ever met.
"The policy of conservatives is to NOT increase the wages of the lowest level among us. They also target their governmental assistance at the top end hoping that it will trickle down. The only thing that trickles down is piss. Policy damn sure is connected to treating those with the least among us.   Caging people with no reason besides that they're brown is not treating them with respect and every conservative in congress could work to stop it but they don't. there's no hiding behind ""we don't make those decisions"". They had the full government for 2 years. No healthcare reform, no drug price limiting, no comprehensive immigration reform, no penalties on businesses that hire illegals. We got give more to the wealthiest and plan on cutting for the neediest. Sounds like jesus huh?"
"It's alright. At first I thought u were being a dick, but then I just kind of let it go. ✌"
"If ,when you see some one talking, you immediately think they are talking about you. Also if you always ask your friends if your friends or not."
"Hmm he said he isn't an incel, why would you keep telling that?  From His post history:  https://imgur.com/IW5awVU  https://imgur.com/nHIBza0  https://imgur.com/DHPHjLj  Do you think this guy doesn't have sex? /u/chaotictransboi"
"Bwahahahahaha....maybe he had a scat fetish lmao .   She's all, this bitch is turning him on!  Omg, too funny.  What a whack job"
That’s the one. Yes.
/u/chaotictransboi  Why people like you base their entre identities on their gender/sexual orientation (or whatever you call it) ?  Lol
"&gt;I don't read fiction  Come on now, comments like that make you sound like an edgy teenager. I hope you've never said that cringe to someone in person."
I don't. The name is a joke lol
"She's a superstar, why wouldnt anyone know her?  (Btw, maybe it was a finger slip, but its insecure not unsecure)    Im just curious as to what kind of superstar someone like this becomes.  Is she American?"
"I don’t really do it with people I know, It’s mainly channels on YouTube and the like, it may be less Dickish (maybe not) but it still bugs the hell out of me"
"I do this, and I would very much like to change that mentality. I want to understand my friends are busy when they can't pick up, but the little voice in the back of my head tells me they're avoiding me.   How can I change this? Does anybody have any tips or help?"
"Was there a lot of emotional fallout? Is that how you came to your realization? What's your take on ""once a cheater, always a cheater?""  Just curious, it sounds like you've been through some rough times, with some silver linings in growing as a person"
Long as the hookers are tested and the blackjack is varied entry I'm down.
"If we were actually professionals / colleagues, I would - because then when he got defensive and angry, I could just end a meeting.  Unfortunately, I live with him. ""Ending a meeting"" isn't really an option when we've still gotta eat dinner together."
"PMS doesn't make me want to kill everyone. Each woman reacts differently. But, you could also say that men have more testosterone, which makes them want to kill everyone all the time, not just once a month. Plus, emotional manipulation isn't only done by women. Most women who are in abusive relationships are abused physically and emotionally, otherwise they wouldn't feel a need to stay with their abusers, or feel as if they don't deserve better. Yes, women are emotional abusers as well, but that doesn't make them more emotional, just more able to manipulate others' emotions. Sociopaths can learn to do the same thing, but that doesn't mean they feel those emotions."
"I guess it would also depend on what kind of message you're replying to. If it's a long story or meaningful message and you're replying with ""👍"" then it seems insensitive and rude. However, if someone's giving you a time and place for something (like a date or appointment) or just answering a question that you've asked them, then it makes a lot more sense to use a thumbs up. I think you're okay here don't worry."
then just stop it. stop feeling that way.
Wait...how is mass immigration going to cause the percentage of men in Europe to double? I've never heard of anything like this. Now I'm very confused.
Not unless the person was being a dick. Xtians in my area of the country try to force their beliefs on the rest of the population like they know better. The first rule of every religion should be the same as for fight club. If they'd keep their beliefs to themselves I wouldn't care what they do within their walls. Unfortunately my taxes subsidize them already.
Your post history Is all a joke too?
"I'm extremely insecure and have pretty bad social anxiety. I'm practically a chronic liar about small stuff, I definitely seek small bits of pity from others, and I lie about things from childhood or current events like what I did over the weekend so I don't seem like a loser to my friends. I know nothing about my childhood doesn't matter or affect anyone but I've tried to stop. I slip sometimes though so I just roll with it, I am doing my best to better myself but I'm still a piece of shit. HOLY SHIT THAT FELT GOOD TO GET OFF MY CHEST  edit: I really do want to change, and I think putting it in writing instead of having it just bounce around in my thoughts will help to make it happen."
Name dropping is a good one
"You mean, the memes I made? Yeah. I mean do you know how memes work? They are litteraly jokes.  I did them on a road trip while bored."
When a person feels the need to slap their partner’s butt in public so anyone watching will know that their partner “belongs” to them.
"Sure, I've had bossed that I've liked. Every one I've had though, I have disagreed with; with time and reflection.  I realized I shouldn't have liked them just because they were nice to me. They were running the business incorrectly -  i.e. lying to customers and employees as well as treating everyone improperly - as stated in my first comment.  Edit: I'm not trying to say there are no good bosses, I've just never experienced one."
"Do...do you actually think the US government is rounding up brown people and putting them in cages? Exclusively because of the color of their skin?  There are definitely penalties for hiring illegals currently in place, but I agree enforcement should be ramped up.  We have a progressive tax system, not regressive."
"If you held a belief that following a set of principles laid out by a higher power would lead to eternal peace, would you not want to share this knowledge with others?  Unfortunately for you, Christ called upon his followers to spread the word. Same for Muslims."
PUMPKIN MAN
"So what makes you think he believes that Trump supporters are nazis? Because Trump supporters share beliefs to actual nazis? No that can’t be it because that’s completely false. Because they have sympathy for the nazis? No that’s false as well. So what conclusion do you think I am going to reach when he says, “Trump supporters are nazis?” I think it’s pretty clear that because Trump supporters aren’t democrats, they are nazis."
An insecure guy he screams alot
"Thank you so much, that actually means a great deal to me. I appreciate your comment."
"And honestly even if you WERE rocking thongs, she probably shouldn't invite people over if she feels the needs to police what other people wear or if she's that worried her husband is going to hop on the first woman he sees in a swimsuit.   Am I aware of the fact that my partner absolutely looks at and appreciates other attractive women from time to time? Of course. Hell, I look at attractive people too. Doesn't mean one of us is going to up and leave the other for someone in a skimpy outfit."
Guilt tripping.
"The progressive tax system has been ground down such that it's a farce.   Conservatives could stop illegal immigration in one bill by making the penalties both corporate and individual to the CFO, ceo and hiring manager substantial but they won't.   We don't have a policy to cage families that try to enter from any port or other border, just the southern one where primarily brown people enter. Pretty clear when you look at republican comments and actions that they are pro-white christian male and anti almost everything that doesnt listen to white christian males."
"Well yes, it has obviously been around for ages, it's not a new definition. Colloquially it just seems more popular lately. Pretty hard to analyze with Trends since 'partner' has so many other meanings and I'm not sure how much Trends looks at social interactions; they certainly aren't weighted heavily in Google's search results.  There is a pretty clear downward trend over the past 5 years in the use of both 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend' though."
Me. Just now.  Really loudly. At work.
That's actually really interesting. I just realised I have my 'I'm paying attention to you' eye contact and I have the second level that you're talking about. I can switch between at will though.
Getting anxious/frustrated after not receiving replied texts from people you care about.
Little to no eye contact in one on one conversations
I don't particularly care what your beliefs tell you to do about spreading your beliefs. I think you should keep your nonsense to yourselves and worry about yourself and not whether someone else is living their lives piously.   Think about it this way: should Hindus be preaching to you constantly about their beliefs in eternal life? What about taoists? What about pastafarians?
"That’s what I meant, I know depression is also a mood and people can feel anxious"
Someone screaming “ I’m very insecure “
I'm an RN and I've noticed this with some other nurses and quite a few nurse's aides. They react as if any criticism or direction is a personal attack on their character. I just don't get it. I've learned that telling them to not take things so personally is also not well received.
"Well, I didn’t steal a car, but otherwise the situation is the same, if not slightly exaggerated"
"This might not be true, but I associate it with this because of myself. When I was like 14 i cut my long hair into a pixie cut because I was insecure and now when I see that even though it’s not necessarily true I feel bad for young girls with that hair cut because all I can think is that they’re going through the same thing I did"

"to be fair tho, my chem teacher does this but I think mainly because he does it in such a way that you cannot tell if he is being for real or joking and is a little scary at times. he's lit tho"
"Nothing, probably, because you aren't worth it.   I'd work on that type of childish behavior in general though. For your sake. You may have problems with finding a job or friends or relationships. Fat humans are still humans, you know? It's funny until your new supervisor is overweight and one of your comments gets out."
"Saying ""I'm so depressed"" or ""I have so much anxiety"" or ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself"" over and over just because they think it is cool and they do not see the severity in what they are saying. Some of these are real though, but you can tell when someone doesn't realize that these are real mental health issues that a lot of us struggle with."
"oh, brother/sister, i meant that as a total joke  it was an old joke on SNL like 30 years ago, about getting over anything, ""stop it!""  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw)"
"Well, I'd still rather open my mouth, say whatever idiotic things that my brain is warning me not to say, and then hear from others that I'm an idiot. If that's what it takes to live the way I want, then that's how i'll do it."

"Constantly explaining minor mistakes: ""Oh I didn't try to make the ball in I was just warming up!"" ""But we're in the middle of a game?"""
"Uhg. This makes me question myself so hard. I semi-regularly (like, once a week I think) go through my fiance's texts. Nothing except for texts, and it's genuinely only because he'll frequently make plans with someone or discuss something relevant to me and he just always forgets to tell me. So it's sorta how I keep myself in the know. As in, are people coming over this weekend and I'll need to cook dinner? Is work getting done on the house that I should know about? How's his mom doing? And it's not that we don't talk daily or that I don't directly ask him these things, he's just very forgetful or will give a vague answer that doesn't give me all the details I need. But I wonder if he thinks I'm being snoopy for darker reasons? Maybe projecting? Overly jealous? Because I certainly don't want it to appear that way.  Then again, the second he set up the fingerprint unlockly thingy on his phone, he reached out and grabbed my finger and booped it on the reader so I could use it too.   I think I'm being insecure and overanalyzing this. Lol."

"Maybe confrontation actually is something he needs, like full on intervention style confrontation.  Like a metaphorical bucket of ice water splashed in his face to wake him up to what he's doing and then reprogramming once he has ""woken up""."
"That's really the worst when people constantly complain about the same attitudes and behaviors that they give to everyone in their life. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. It's like a weird insecure narcissism that you can't really reason with. My mom isn't a bad person, she just seems to have zero ability to self reflect and I just don't understand that way of thinking."
"Last day of antibiotics!! I cannot wait to have Real People Food again, I have now become physically repulsed by the smell/taste of chicken noodle soup."
"I know I'm a bit late here, but I wanted to share my ""that guy"" story: On the way over to his house for a BBQ, my brother and I invented a fake computer virus that would ""reformat your processor."" We worked out a couple details (""you have to send the computer back to the manufacturer!"") and got to the party and told our bullshitter friend about it. He had a friend who had the virus and was waiting to get his computer back from the manufacturer. Outstanding!"
"Not really. I was harder on myself than my partner was on me. I considered myself a good person, but I committed something that I tried to prevent happening to me (to an unhealthy degree.) So that prompted a lot of self-reflection.   It made me realize that this is not something that someone does to hurt another person, and that no degree of love, pleading, or control will prevent it from happening. All that matters is if that person prioritizes their partner's feelings and the preservation of their relationship over their own selfish desires. I think that having those desires is normal and probably inevitable.   But we're humans-- we are capable of the great feat of shitting in a toilet and not just out on the street. ""I can't help it,"" isn't an excuse, as we can control even the most routine bodily functions-- even sneezing!  I think it just boils down to good ol' emotional control. And to me, that means being able to process emotions in a logical, considerate way-- whether it's lust, jealousy, fear, sadness, etc. I mean, maybe if someone genuinely and irreversably does not care about other people, then they can't be helped. I don't know; I'm not a psychologist. But if you're a regular person like me, who sometimes does shitty things, you can learn from your mistakes. I'm not sure why cheating would be exempt from that."
My love for baggy clothes. I never feel 100% comfortable in fitted clothes.

"There could be a lot of tell tale signs, depends on The situation, if someone is negative all the time, they probably have negative thoughts about themselves. Constantly comparing people against each other or against themselves to make them feel better. Not being able to handle a simple conversation and lacking basic social skills to maintain small talk (small talk is awkward for everyone, but it all about how you handle, it's an art in some ways) the best way to not be insecure is to not care what others think about you. People change their mind and are flaky, but I believe God's opinion about me always stays the same, hope this helps."
Alright buddy. You do you.

I'm really not sure how you're not getting this. You're assuming so many things that weren't actually said.
"Cute. But I'm not telling a stranger. Not that it even matters. Stop egging on the argument, you look desperate.   Why don't you go rant about ""fatties"" to someone who cares?"

"Electric vehicles absolutely do NOT have anywhere near infinite torque. Their party trick is that they deliver all the torque they do have at 0 RPM, whereas a typical gasoline engine won't deliver maximum torque until it hits somewhere in the 4000-6000 RPM range. Try doing burnouts with one of those bare bones electric econoboxes, and you'll pretty quickly see that they do not have infinite torque."
"Electric vehicles do NOT have nearly infinite torque. They're just capable of delivering all the torque that they do have at 0 RPM (when the vehicle is at a standstill). A typical gasoline vehicle won't reach maximum torque output until typically somewhere in the 4000-6000 RPM range. The instantaneous torque deliver helps electric cars launch off of the line very well... IF you're driving an electric vehicle that has a decent amount of torque, like a Tesla."
"Electric cars can win in drag races pretty easily, if you put a big enough motor in them, but road courses with twists and turns are actually not so ideal for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles with significant amounts of range (Tesla) tend to be pretty heavy. The weight is down low, so that helps them keep their balance, but weight in general is absolutely not your friend in the corners. Plus you run into heating issues with the battery when you put them under sustained high loads, such as racing conditions.  Don't get me wrong, you can make a fast electric race car, but they present significant engineering challenges. It's pretty hard to make the case that they're somehow inherently better than gasoline race cars on a race track, especially a curvy one."

"I talk about my mental health issues when appropriate. Not keeping it a secret is helpful for me, personally. It's helped me come to terms with it. It helps me be more aware of it, which in turn helps me deal with it better. I've also helped others by being open about it. They've felt safe to open up to me about similar issues they have and I've made very close friends this way. I've helped them seek help, and feel more ""normal"".   Believe me, it's never bragging. I wouldn't wish this shit on anyone. But I'm not afraid to talk about it."

"From what I’ve been told but have yet to apply in real life is that no one is obsessed with you as much as you are. Also- looking at the facts. I think I’m a terrible, unloveable person. The people in my life are all (or mostly) good hearted, caring people. If I was not similar to them, why would they keep me around? To that, it poses the question- maybe they’re just too kind and wonderful to tell me how they really feel? Maybe they just pretend to be my friend so I won’t commit suicide or feel lonely or realize I truly AM a horrible person? Which circles back to the fact that no one is that obsessed with you that they will be your friend or be nice to you just to spare your feelings. Nobody has time for that kind of effort because they have their own lives to focus on which you are apart of but do not make up the entirety.  Personally, I’m aware this is delusional. On an okay day, I can recognize this. On a day of extreme insecurity or depression or anxiety, I can pick it apart until it fits my delusional beliefs.   So- I know but I don’t know, ya know? :)"
I dare you to work a retail or a service job. There is a high turnover rate for a reason. It should be a reqirement for everyone to test social skills under pressure. It would change your mind instantly that people are different and its fine.

I totally agree. I’m not a super huge fan of how they’ve torn everything down and rebuilt these ultra modern landscapes but also I think some of the old structures were truly falling apart due to poor planning when they were built and extreme weather over the years so I see why they’ve probably done it.   I got a BS in Aeronautical Management Technology and I’m going for a second BS in InfoSec. Hoping to combine the two and either work for an airline SOC or Some other branch of cybersecurity related to aviation. I currently do encryption analysis for an IT company in Phoenix. How about you?
"Yeah I agree that some updating is always necessary, but from a grad student perspective i think the big issue is that Michael Crow believes that ASU can endlessly expand online course offerings without paying for more graduate students. The structure of the course offerings, and how they pay for the classes, needs to include funding the reasonable amount of TA support for those classes, and at a reasonable rate. Most TAs in my program make $18k, which is a good $5k below what other grad students at other universities make, even in lower cost areas. We are underpaid and overworked, with a single TA being assigned to massive 75+ student online classes. You can't have more online classes without paying for the people that are responsible for doing all the grading for those classes, and I certainly think that ASU needs to fund grad education better.  &amp;#x200B;  Wow, that's so cool! I study anthropology, and specifically paleoanthropology. So I study human evolution, and I'm specifically interested in how sexual dimorphism has changed over time."

"Exactly! There are a very few things I do wear or own that do serve as an advertisement to some extent, band tees being a great example (I actually only own a few of those-- Dropkick Murphys and Lindsey Stirling, and one for the movie Labyrinth which is incidentally the most-complimented thing I have ever owned... not that anyone asked), but I struggle to understand why someone could or would even want to align themselves so closely to some corporation.  Like the way people spend hundreds on stupid shirts that say ""SUPREME"" or perhaps the most ridiculous was back in the late-80's there were tons of people walking around in sweatshirts and shit that said B.U.M. on them (made by a company called ""BUM Apparel"" or some shit).  And yet, however many of us there are who feel second-hand embarrassment seeing that shit there are probably twice as many who not only think it's cool to wear ASS-BLASTER jeans or whatever, or to pay double for them, but they pay double for them *because* the say ASS-BLASTER.    People spend buckets of money on Nikes and iPhones and will swear it's because the product quality is so great but I guarantee that if you offered many of them an identical replica of the product in every functional way except that nobody looking at it could tell it was an official Apple/Nike product, they wouldn't buy it.  They're paying for the image, and many of us see the image they're purchasing as being one that they're an idiot who wastes money thinking it makes them look cool when it actually does the opposite.  Like the Emporer's New Clothes, in a lot of ways.  It defies all reason."
"Yeah I've read some stuff, such as a research paper about the ""poverty brain"" and other articles on the topic of psychology specific to poor people and it's fascinating the way some really common behaviors manifest as a result of poverty that aren't always what you'd expect.  Somewhere I've seen mentioned (and this part I can't recall when/where or whether it was a credible source) that *less*-wealthy people are actually *more* fond of shit like Coach and Louis Vuitton bags because they think it helps them project an appearance of wealth and status.  I think an example was South/Central Americans (Cubans maybe?) who come over and spend every penny driving around in fancy BMWs and Mercedes (on a lease, no less), wearing designer clothes and carrying the latest iPhone then go home to a shithole apartment they share with 10 other people because to them it's such a huge priority to appear successful superficially and they have no money left over to support themselves when it comes to the rest of their lives.  Of course none of this is universal, as is apparent by this thread. Some of us have had our experience growing up poor lead us to reject overpriced designer goods as unnecessary wastes of money, and others view expensive brands as a way to feel elevated into a higher status.  I guess thinking about that has me realizing I shouldn't be so judgmental or critical of people wearing that shit because it might not just be dumb, rich people wasting their money on frivolous things; some are actually just people who are still suffering the negative effects of poverty-- maybe a bit like a victim of child molestation growing up to be a dangerously promiscuous adult.  Now I feel bad. :("

I’m very insecure
"Accept no criticism. For real? You have to be confident enough about yourself to read or listen to advices from others and understand that you can be wrong. When people try too much to make excuses for any mistakes they made, it's when I know they are insecure."

"Its been done, multiple times, in fact. Multiple as a family and twice as many times one on one. Got to a point where I laid into him as aggressively as was reasonable according to context instead of pulling punches, just to clear my conscience before washing my hands of further efforts. Totally fucked situation, but it's legit on par with someone with Co, drug, or alcohol dependence though the type of toxicity is different."

"I guess for me it was part peer pressure. Fortunately the designers here were limited to low end designers that insist on plastering their name in big letters everywhere. High end designers by in large don't do that  So when your peers brag about Bench, Firetrap, Jack &amp; Jones clothes etc... you do the exact same. Only later did I realise that honestly most of this is pointless"

"Agreed, mental health doesnt excuse any of his actions.   However, if you actually read the previous comment you would see that it was an explanation of how he viewed and percieved the world. (And neither were my comment)  Not any actions he performed due to mental health which make it seem you're making a point of.   I wish more people were knowledgeable of mental health, because that kind of attitude he/she had/has against his ex fiancè only contributes to worse mental health and more suicide."
First of all my guy. You decide a person has schizophrenia based on literally 1 comment. It takes months of therapy to diagnose someone. You’re the reason why people don’t believe people who self diagnose.
"There are many people who would consider it hate. That’s what I’m getting at. Many, many of those same people would aim more vitriol at people who wear red hats than the people who don’t believe in gay marriage aim at gays.  That said, it isn’t a case of equal rights. It is a case of legal definitions changing. There are still people who can’t marry the people they love after all."
What screams “I’m very insecure”?  Apparently damn near every company who handles our personal information.  Their servers seem to have some mating call for hackers.  “I’m very insecure!”  must be it.
Yeah it definitely is. I’m agreeing and saying it sucks and people could not contribute to their kid’s insecurity. Which would be really cool.
"Yeah that was one that took me years to realize-- a lot of the Eastern European kids I encountered a little later would walk around wearing AEROPOSTALE stuff and I just figured it must be some fancy brand because it was just like Hilfiger, Abercrombie, Boss and all the other brands that came before in the way it appeared overnight and seemed to consume an entire generation of image-conscious youth, but eventually I learned that they were actually not an expensive brand, they just looked and acted like one.  One thing I haven't given some of these popular brands credit for is that they often are doing a better job of cutting their clothes in a way that just fits in a more flattering way on attractive body shapes.  At least up until fairly recently, American Apparel was really designed to be worn by very thin women or fit, athletic men.  So when hot people wear clothes for hot people they look great.  And although there are plenty of decent designs in budget clothing you can buy at Fred Meyer or Wal-Mart or whatever, they're cut in a more generic shape meant to fit reasonably on a greater variety of body shapes but as a trade-off, they don't have the same tendency to accentuate the great features that hot people have (speaking generally, anyway-- I don't think only skinny people are good-looking).  So there were moments I kind of hated that because I was always a skinny and fairly short guy and probably would have fit great into some of it but I was so averse to paying a premium to splatter a company's name across my chest that I just stuck with the boxy JC Penney plain black/white/whatever t-shirts."

It was this crew i hung around with when i was 16-18 years old that dissolved over time because we decided to get our shit together and went to schools, got jobs etc.  We drank, smoked weed, hung around in the streets etc. but never harmed anyone but he was the major asshole of the group."

"And how are you not getting that that is distinct from ""people I disagree with are nazis""?"
Incel isn't just about not having sex lmao
I think they're picking the places to enforce based on the skintone of who's coming.  Trump has basically said as much. Because he's a racist and a xenophobe and his policies follow suit.   It's a ticketable offense. A misdemeanor.  You locked in cages indefinitely over a misdemeanor? They locking people in cages coming in from canada over a misdemeanor? No no they're not.
When people are mean to you and when you try to talk it out they explain that from their perspective they were “standing up for themselves”.
This might be just a competitive nature as well.
"Sounds like you need to get him professional help, unless you already have and it isn't working."

"Most of my family are red hats. I care for them but I find their beliefs deserving of judgment. I'm not going to start shit with a red hat just because, or honk my horn and yell at the group of old pro-Trump people on the sidewalk because that doesn't solve anything.   There's douche baggery on both ends I guess. At least I don't feel lumped in with red hats. But when it comes to those 'everything is hate' groups, their behavior reflects on the reasonable people on the LGBT community. There's a chunk of us that are still able to understand nuance."

"Many, many things. For example;  \-covering a wall in crosses or other religious symbols  \-hyperfocusing on appearance  \-bragging at every available opportunity  \-always needing to have the last word in a conversation  \-getting aggressive when proven wrong in a disagreement  \-latching on to shallow fads to seem popular  \-trying too hard to make people laugh (surprise surprise, a lot of comedians actually have issues with insecurity), usually through self-deprecation  \-jumping to the worst possible conclusion in social circumstances, e.g. ""Nobody responded to my group text, guess I have no friends now.""  If these seem kind of contradictory, it's because different people deal with insecurity in different ways, and your personality tends to affect how you do so. Just look at the stereotype of the ""basic bitch,"" extremely shallow women only concerned with their appearance and social standing because they feel insecure about both, which you primarily find in middle-class because they're ""rich"" enough to go shopping every week for that new ""stylish"" dress that just looks like a nylon trash bag/tube sock hybrid, but poor enough to see that they aren't up to Melinda Gates level."

Example, when you have a messy break up and your ex goes around self victimizing themselves, rallying up an army and painting you as a villian. In actuality, both parties are hurting, every story has two sides and no one has to be a villian that's immature IMO.

The gym I attend there was a girl and her boyfriend. Boyfriend always came with his work clothes to watch over his girlfriend. He didn't even have a membership. He was trying to create perimeter always to prevent anyone talking to her. She was so embarrassed and broke up with him one day and stopped coming.  I will remember that guy as an embodiment of insecurity until the day I die. It was the saddest sight really.

"God ... okay, first off, I  desperately want women friends. Desperately, but for whatever reason I never vibe right with most women. I do have a select few with whom we all kind of get each other. But for the most part it always feels forced, specifically if you and your male partner are hanging out with another couple, you're expected to be friends with the woman and not the man. I've always found this really weird, especially if you have much more in common with the man (which often happens! my partner will have more in common with the woman). Once I thought I was talking to a like-minded woman while our guys were chatting. Out of awkwardness, I said, ""Don't you hate how us women are always expected to get along in couple situations like this?"" and she took extreme offense to it. So much so that she would direct her husband away from our street when they went on walks if I was watering the front garden. She often behaved passive aggressive towards me. I have always tried to chat her up and talk about things I knew she was interested in, but from then on she repeatedly shut me down, sometimes aggressively in front of other people at parties.  I genuinely only meant that... you know its weird that us women are expected to talk about ""woman"" shit, indoors, closed off from the men's conversation. Otherwise if I wandered off with the guys I'd leave the other woman feeling weird, and that's not right. Maybe I'm not explaining this right because I still feel unsatisfied with my comment. lol Does anyone know what I mean though?  Also.. hanging out with the group of guys and being part of their conversation while ALL the women are inside feels wrong. It feels like im insulting the group of women or seeking attention, and it's not the case. I'd honestly rather participate in outrageous jokes about various topics than have a polite conversation about whats new with each person."
"Seriously! My boyfriend gets along with women way more and I get along with men way more. When we hang out as two or more couples though, we're expected to separate. :/"

"I didn't talk to the bulk of the second year students.  I also didn't  look at the spread for when people were ready to defend.  There was a bit of a badge of honor to be an 8th year student.  Had I asked those questions back in early 2002, I probably would have chosen a different school.  I also should have asked more questions around what people were interested in after graduation.  Regardless, I would have been impressed with their research and the breadth of what.theu we're doing, but talking with people about long term goals and direction is also important.  I didn't realize how snubbed a person with an interest  in public  health would be in a program of this caliber.  It was my own naivite."
"That's not always the case. It's not always attention seeking. Sometimes people just gravitate towards conversation that is more familiar, honest, and less polite.     ""When they hang out with other women, instead of being the center of attention, they're expected to actually have a personality, and nothing makes them stand out.""    Yeah... no. In some cases sure, but nah. Have you ever watched a woman say something awfully true, abrasive, and ""unladylike"" (for lack of a better word)? Have you seen the looks on said women's faces? yeah, those looks are alienating. Time to go see what the guys are talking about."

"100% this. God yes. It's not even like ""I want to talk about video games because I'm a cool gamer girl blablabla"" its not. even. Men are more interested in saying what they want to say and for some god damn reason a lot of women do not tolerate it. I think the majority of us women have grown up sitting nice, being polite because we have always been scrutinized to a point where the creative parts of us have been all pruned away. I want to talk about how there is a song that says ""I want to kiss your poopoo lala"" I want to laugh at the stupid shit we all actually want to be talking about.     But I also agree with builders vs breakers. I am also a builder. I work in a male dominated field and we hired on a woman who was trying to break into our field (she worked in another dept). She was learning a little bit and was embarrassed she didn't know how to talk to the guys to get help, so she would ask me, but through chat and in secret. Later she would say what she learned from me out loud to the group and pretend she knew all along. I knew what she was doing, and it's fine. You get it girl, I want you to feel good and not look stupid. Well, I stopped helping her because she took that knowledge and cut me down in front of my direct coworkers all the time. Belittling me and loudly respecting the men's opinions more than mine. Fuck that bitch. I have to work with these guys, ya know?"

How am I either? You seem to argue in the most irrational ways. Insulting me is not a valid argument and the insults themselves are void of reasoning. You have to learn how to properly argue before you expect me to respond. I won’t entertain you anymore and I will not insult you either. Have a good day.

"For better or for worse, my Mustang is not really about sound deadening. I've had the car six months and was trying to be at least somewhat careful with my hearing.

Me on meds - waiting politely for my turn, listening patiently to what the other person has to say.  Think of it as an opposite spectrum to the extremely shy people who will not talk until they thought things through extremely well."

"Exactly... I took it a bit the the extreme and stayed fucked up all throughout high school... just floating by (when I was there)... and ended up with like a 2.8ish GPA... but I had a 32 ACT... But I have no regrets! I still obtained 2 Bachelor’s degrees (and slowly working on a Master’s)... I helped guide my daughter to somewhere in the middle... She took AP courses, has like a 3.9 GPA and a 25 ACT... but never stressed out... has lived and partied and will still get into a good school... There’s always a perfect balance somewhere 🤷‍♂️"
Those people are the worst of sorts!

"I actually live in a city and spend 40-60 minutes in public transportation to get to work. And I know that it's awful. But I would always prefer that before going to work I hate for 5 minutes. I'm talking in this thread's context ""Hate your job?"" Then it's only an excuse for not getting out of your comfort zone. Working a job I can actually enjoy and not get home depressed and exhausted every day changed my life a lot more than surviving public transportation."
Saying sorry except for when there British then there just being British 😂
Never be afraid to be who you are because people won’t like you.   The truth is there are some people who won’t like you.   If you’re always seeking to manage people’s perception of you - you’re losing you - and you ARE more likeable than that! X  Edit: you can’t really control id someone likes you or not
Liberals Scream that all the time.

"I walked to the local park with my friend. I saw a familiar kid there (I'm 14) so I say hi, knowing he never really liked me, but I felt like we could be friends, so I said hi. He then proceeded to tell me to shut the fuck up and go the hell away. So I said ""jeez dude alright"". Then he decided to stand up and ask me to fight him, telling me that he wasn't scared of me.   The guy was 17."
"Yeah, they're not much for appreciating a good sounding engine, are they?  How do the BMWs sound straight piped? Do they get those crackles and pops? That's the thing I miss most when my side dumps are closed."
You should have just written it down and passed it around
"Depending on the motor and tune, some of them snap/crackle/pop but mine doesn't. I get some crackle on a cold start but when its warm its just a smooth n/a inline six sound. I really enjoy it.   Some motor/tune combos are pretty nasty tho and the newer turbo ones seem to have a lot of snap/crackle/pop"
"A straight six sounds like a lot of fun. It's too bad they're kind of hard to find and even harder to fit in engine bays. That could be a fun swap for a project car.  I can't wait to hear all the fun turbo sounds! It's not in the budget quite yet, but a DIY turbo and tuned Miata is definitely in my future! Haven't figured out what I'll do for an exhaust system yet, but there are options. I'm told you can even tune the megasquirt to spit fire, if you're willing to take that risk."
Always having to be right. Over-competitiveness.

I'm always worried people notice how quiet I am. Sometimes I try to seem confident (like in interviews I feel like taking pauses to think is fine). But when I try to make small talk and idk what to say it feels really awk...Also I've realized that I'm ok with silence a lot of the time but I'm afraid the other person isn't ok with it and think it's awk which then makes me nervous...

Writing things out for sure is a healthy coping mechanism. It helps put abstract thoughts in concrete form in front of you.  It’s like a conversation with the unhelpful part of your brain!
Shame dumping.  you blame others for your problems.

Lol literally none of that qualifies a person as a loon.  Attention seeking is normal teenage behavior. Got any more awesome victim blaming scenarios you can share?

"Constantly lying. Stop lying, it’s so much more respectful to say you’re struggling and need help in any way. Or that you actually don’t know what you’re doing. There’s nothing wrong with saying that. Rather than getting caught in a lie about something."

"particularly strange is when the lie is obviously a lie. puts us in a bad position, being blatantly lied to out of insecurity. not very diplomatic to call them out on the lie.   like i had a friend in high school who pulled this all the time. one morning I picked him up before school and he tells me 'my dad said I look like Brad Pitt!' dude looks nothing like Brad Pitt. like *at all*. I can't even think of someone he looks like, he's so strange-looking. maybe a chubbier blonder Paul Dano."

"Yes! Sometimes I regret starting to tell a story about halfway through and I can’t concentrate on it anymore. I also look for peoples expressions/body language as I talk and I run with the slightest thing, like if they glance away I think they are no longer interested, I start saying words wrong and/or get confused about what my point was."
hmmmmm well shit and i was about to say we were over that
That is my favorite answer to this question. Upvoted.
I immediately think im annoying whenever i say even one thing in a conversation and my friends just hang out with me out of pity
Explaining shit you just did. Saying you are confident. Re adjusting your cloths a lot. Bragging about or justifying your large things you buy. Idk what you owne or what you where and if you want to bye a fancy car and where Gucci I don't care. But I don't care in the most literal way possible. Dont tell me about it.

You’ve got to show humility before you gain any respect.  You know what’s the icing on the cake though? You’ll probably always stay at minimum wage thinking you’re some hot shot while in the mean time some humble hard working fellow will join the same company a couple month later and end up In a high position than you are in a shorter span of time.  There’s no growth in a person who thinks they already know it all."

"Oh, stop (go on...)"
"Uhm. As someone who’s insecure - probably the fact:  - I jump if anyone comes near me / tries to touch me  - I don’t like people being behind me, I freak out   - I can’t look people in the eyes when talking to them. It freaks me out   - I can’t leave the house alone, it terrifies me   - I automatically think people are ignoring me if they don’t reply   - I feel the need to justify everything I do, even if it’s perfectly reasonable.   - I constantly feel the need to apologise to people, even if I’ve done nothing wrong   - I overthink everything.  - I am paranoid about the way I look.  - I won’t eat in public and if I do - everyone else has to be eating, and if someone looks at me I’ll stop until they look away.   - I am forever picking at my imperfections and looking for them.   - I am always afraid people will judge me, I dread dislocating a joint in public (I have a connective tissue disorder that causes frequent dislocations)   - I’m always afraid that if i go on a date they’ll reject me because of my disability.   *I acknowledge all of my insecurities, and try to work around the fact I am insecure - it’s easier when you know you’re insecure to try to push your insecurities to one side and work around them.*"
when your input on topics come across as dogmatic.
"Constantly complaining about black people, asian people, latin people etc, polygamist, gay people, cuckolds, swingers, punks, hippies, and saying they're ruining society.   Saying that women need to cover up more because men are just men BS and women are sacred objects. Or that men and women have certain things or aspects that should be exclusive. Like all women should be dainty and all men strong.   People who say money is everything too. Usually.  Basically anything like that or similar. You get it. It just screams insecure to me usually."
as a dissabled person who went threw years of abuse because of dissability there are reasons other than insecurity that people do this. you know . like when someone once set you on fire .
"You're assuming a lot. Almost as if you lived that person's life.  That shitty assumption makes you sound like a Boomer, yikes."
"When someone automatically believes that something you did wrong and affected them in a way or another came exclusively from your ill intentions towards them, even if you know it didn’t. This happened to me: I refused to pay to a friend for material for a class at school because I realized it was better for me and them if I got it some other way, but he automatically assumed that it was because I wanted to be mean to him and didn’t care, then he straight up started calling me out. To me that was a huge sign that he was feeling really insecure about his relationships."

"I do this myself, I've been highly insecure since about 3rd or 4th grade and I will always worry about how my hair and eyes look compared to the rest of my body, and I've noticed it in a lot of other people. Like, they'll kind of touch their hair and their eyes and then examine themselves and they'll look a little paranoid while they're standing there and processing it. I (fem) have and always have had INSANELY curly blonde hair and icy blue eyes, but I had really wide shoulders for some reason and I was always really paranoid about them, and I would always mess with my hair and then just stare at my shoulders and nitpixk every little thing about myself, and I still do sometimes"
Let me know how this attitude works out for you. Always try to be worth more than they pay you. Then you will be more valuable in their eyes and be promoted.  Just stop for a second and put yourself in their shoes and see what kind of employee you would want to hire and see how you stack up to that.
"No then you just give them free labor. You're disposable to them, no matter how much you delude yourself. If you weren't disposable they would pay you more."
Because it's been so long since any of this drama went down and I am pretty happy in the relationship now. But it was all fucked up and I just worry for us. I also have depression and other messy mental disorders and shit gets confusing. Life is messy though and nothings is perfect or flawless so one more shot I will shoot because I think its worth it.
putting other people down to make themselves look better.   i've been in that situation multiple times and it always turns out they're extremly insecure. you just have to show them you're not gonna tako any of ther bs.
this post screams that
Why is everyone here giving off a vibe that that being insecure is for pussies and they've never been insecure about anything?

Hell yes! It would be like the survivor meets some teenage angst drama where they get pissed off competing with each other &amp; resort to other means to maintain attention
"My SO does this and I try SO hard to be respectful. I know he's had shitty relationships in the past where no one was interested in what they had to say and I know how that is. But even if I interject at a pause, with something related to the subject, he often feels like I'm interrupting or derailing him. So I keep my mouth shut, but then I'm not participating in the conversation and that annoys me. If I wait until the subject is exhausted before I speak, I'm waiting so long that I forgot what I wanted to say. Or it's not relevant anymore because he went on a tangent without stopping. And often when he's quiet and I am talking, he's tired and not in the mood to talk so I'm just talking to an annoyed wall.  It feels like I can't win and it feels unfair when I just want to talk, same as he does."

You may have 2,000 more social interactions before you meet another person that you click with, but at least that person will be genuine, and that relationship will be real &lt;3"

"I can relate to this guy. I have struggled with crippling insecurities and self doubt since childhood. Bullying, trauma and neglect or a few key factors. Only up until recently, (12 months ago) i started seeing a psychologist; where she after 7 months said that she was 99.9% certain i was bipolar, which is what I got diagnozed with. I really regret not reaching out sooner, because even the tiniest things that make my social life difficult, I never would have thought was key elements in a much bigger picture. Now I know whats up, and let me tell you, life is 10 times easier than it was one year ago"

Now I know some people have one for friends that you only allow them to follow. However, some of these people let you follow the second account but now the main one. I honestly don’t know the point to this.   Note: this was back when I was in high school when I remember seeing these, I don’t communicate with anyone like this anymore."

"D:  I don't remember, I guess I didn't learn anything :("
Tbh I get that but a lot of it can be because the person is perhaps very introverted. It can make them want to create a small social space in which they can actually express themselves while filtering the perceived judgment or need of professionalism that they have on main accounts followed by people such as co-workers or family.    Only letting you follow their finsta is kinda weird but it also may be that they want to show you the inner side of themself to you and are self conscious about how they make themselves appear to the wider public.
Aggressive behavior from someone wearing lots of denim.
Hating on the pretty girl/handsome guy at work or school. There is an attractive young woman at my job who gets blamed for every person who gets written up at work.

"YES THIS. Also in the workplace:  If you have a problem with someone, not taking it up with them directly and instead going over their heads to your/their superior. It just shows that you either want to build yourself up in your boss's eyes by tearing your colleague down, or else you're too much of a coward to have an honest conversation.  (Obviously, I'm not talking about if there is actual abuse or harassment going on, or if you're afraid for your well-being; this is just for run-of-the-mill petty shit)"
Yeah I'd say that's only acceptable if you've spoke to them many times but they refuse to fix their mistake and just disregard your feedback.   That happens a lot. People have done it to me instead of just saying it to my face.

"To people reading this, looking for help:  Jocko Willink speaks about rape, in the first podcast mentioned, in a very graphic way.  He then goes on, to calling the member of ISIS sub-human. While it's a hard to stay civilized, after reading something like the horrible experience ""Leila"" and many other women have made, it also carries the same undertone that makes places like Guantanamo possible, despite it being against the Human Rights Convention and the Geneva Conventions.  Especially if you are a emotionally unstable person, I recommend not watching this. This guy is not a therapist and that's who you should be talking to. He won't help you with your insecurity, or help you heal. He instead will show you how to cover it up and compensate, which can lead to a much worse depression, long-term. I don't know if that's ""Jocko Willink"" intention, or if he is actually trying to help people, but what he is doing is problematic. Making a podcast to help people with mental conditions and lead of with something like that, is incredible dangerous and either very stupid or very manipulative.  To alpine1221:  I know, you think you are supporting a good cause and I understand that. That said, for the reasons I listed above, I ask you not to share this in areas with high visitor numbers of mentally unstable people, like this post. Your own political views are a very different thing, I don't know if you see yourself as ""red pilled"", so please understand that this isn't meant as a personal attack. I just hope to stop people from getting harmed further. I understand, if that wasn't your intention, but helping others was. Don't stop trying to help others, just think more about when you post what. Using a platform for advice, to further political goals, is not acceptable and that's what Jocko Willink is doing in these podcasts."
Excessive social media posts of yourself (pictures)
One thing I did warn people about is that the subject matter is pretty dark that being said is you can learn a lot by finding the extremes of human behavior. This is not an end all be all for life advise but you might be able to get a few very important lessons from it. In episode 98 Dr. Jordan Peterson talked about the reason why mass amounts of people commit atrocities and that reason is due to people not wanting to look like a coward. The point that is to be made in that case is to always stick to your morals even when you are faced against peer pressure. I would consider myself to have more of a left political leaning and yes I don’t agree with everything he says but that being said it is not a political podcast. It’s a podcast that shows human behavior in the most extreme circumstances and shows how some of the worst atrocities could’ve been prevented if only some people said no at the beginning. Also from what I understand is that ‘red pilled’ means being a member of a group of guys that sexually assault women due to them being unsure of their masculinity. How would you come up with that conclusion based on a comment that I think could help a few people?
"&gt;""Fuck her, she's trying to avoid me. I don't care about her anyway.""  Is this like a personal attack or something?"
Wise words :)
Felt the same...
"&gt; I always think everyone is better than me; I can see all the good in everybody, but I know that they see all the bad in me.  This so much.  I'm constantly thinking I'm worthless and everybody is better than me and it's not worth their time to get to know me.  It's gotten so much worse over the years.."
"I didn't really answer, because of it being dark topics, but because these are topics that can trigger people, with mental health problems. While I generally agree, that these extremes are interesting to talk about, those aren't good topics for a thread like this.  Being ""red pilled"" is used by several groups, but most notably the alt-right. Podcast 98 opened up with a political statement that is directly out of the playbook, of the alt-right. Calling people sub-human, comes from the idea that there are races and was popularized by the Nazi regime. The Intro is a political statement, regardless of intent. It became one, by using this kind of rhetoric. I though you were posting Jocko Willink's self-help stuff, seems like the topic was a different one - Which opens up the question, why you would post that in the first place.  That said, like 99% of self-help books/programs,  Jocko Willink isn't really helpful. He's either not intelligent enough to understand, that people need individual solutions, based on their symptoms and problems... Or he is actively trying to draw in mentally unstable individuals.  While I don't know if  Jocko Willink and  Jordan Peterson subscribe to the alt-right directly, it is obvious that they give people, from said group a platform, and that they use rhetoric, associated with the alt-right.  Also, this idea, that atrocities could have been prevented by someone speaking up, isn't reflected by the evidence. There have been people speaking up, regardless of which regime we are talking about. These people were all killed or silenced in other ways, for speaking up. Being blinded by your morals and worldview, is what leads to these situations - Believes like the idea, that someone can be sub-human, and that in consequence, we don't have to tread them like humans. Regardless, if that is a race, a sex or a group of people, who have done thing, we don't agree with. The problem, seems to me, is that not enough people actually resisted, when their rights and the rights of others were ripped away."

"If people didn’t actually abuse you? Because no one deserves to be degraded for their mistakes, and although I know it feels like your fault(after ages of this) please remember that mistakes are natural &amp; human- *everyone* makes them. Heck, every *thing* makes them. Even machines make mistakes &amp; break down. That’s why we have maintenance!   Instead of abuse, your mistakes ought to be met with patience, humor, kindness, education, and a sense of perspective. Instead of namecalling you need a safe place to practice making mistakes and recovering, like stuntmen learn to fall and get back up. Making mistakes is no problem. The problem is that no one taught you how to deal with them effectively and move on. Even bigger mistakes or just bad choices, none of it is served by abuse.   You’re worth not abusing. You’re more than your mistakes."

"&gt;Making mistakes is no problem. The problem is that no one taught you how to deal with them effectively and move on.  My train of thought is: ""I screwed it up, let's do this again (and again) until it works"". But people don't seem to be that understanding and one mistake may make them create some vile preconceptions about you, which are permanent. Good luck convincing people you aren't shitty if they won't bother to look past your stupid mistake(s) and keep treating you like someone lesser than them instead.  And it's not all about relationships with people. For example, you have only so many chances at college. You can't be a slow learner, if you screw up an exam a few times you're done. You have to waste a whole year just because of a thing you could fix in a few days. Again, it can be chalked up to people being unforgiving.   Life often doesn't give a chance for redemption (where it really could; where no-one is getting harmed. I'm not saying a surgeon should kill people with his stupid mistakes until they get skilled at their job, for example) and it's really aggravating."

"I know I’m like a month late, but one of my best friends who I’ve known half my life has become this, and we’re approaching our late 20s. Whenever I better myself he always spins it negatively. Like when I was moving to a new city, his first response was “oh because you think you’re better than everyone here.” Even though he had moved to a new city before me. When I was more depressed I could always tell he received satisfaction from it. Like “it’s okay to have mental illness.” But really what he meant is “you better have mental illness.”  It’s weird because he wasn’t like this when he was younger. He had a tough life but was always very responsible and fair and whatnot. Then in his mid 20s something flipped and he changed drastically. And it’s sucks because I feel like he’s trying to box me out of our friend’s group and I just feel in a very weird position. We have an upcoming event, and I don’t know if I should go. If I do, I might be uncomfortable. He might afterwards spin me being uncomfortable to convince the other group members XYZ about me. If I don’t go he’ll say it’s because I think I’m better than everyone and spin that some way. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be a person I don’t want to engage with those tactics."

I just tell it to people with a smile so if they are disappointed they are just stupid and generally it works well  Once a guy came in a group of people where i was and asked ""does someone got a problem with me?"" i answered him "" yes; yourself because you ask the question "" later he said my answer blowed his mind i was proud of me 😄"
