are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

"Yes he did. Check his profile, he’s got posts from a few days ago :)"
Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍
"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"
:) I’m proud of you dude :)
Prayers
Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx

Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"

You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!

Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"

That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍
"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"
:) I’m proud of you dude :)
Prayers
Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you

"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."

Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart!

I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori.

Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"

That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!

"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome.

DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"

I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say?

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."

Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."

I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍
"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."

However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality.

"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg

"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

You’re alive!

"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven.

"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."

HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"

Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)

Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"

Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"

are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."

Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)

"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"

"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
I commend you OP. So happy for you
Glad you made it through. God bless you brother

It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
@op update ?
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!

Glad your okay. God bless brother.
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""

JFC you are one tough MF
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
are you okay bro?????
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
"This is insane, your awesome"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"
You don't how to read?
"Glad you lived boi, hopefully we'll end this fucking disease soon."
Update: he survives
He literally appreciated it tho
Amen
"Just checking on the posts I’ve saved here, glad you’re still with us"
Scrolled down to find this. Hope all is well
"brass monkey, that funky monkey"
are you in surgery yet
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."
NICE
Nice

"Yes he did. Check his profile, he’s got posts from a few days ago :)"
Did you make it?
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
Good man.
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
what a shitty thing your friend said
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
You're a fuckin sigma male
Glad to read that you’re okay
Glad to hear that! :)
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
"I am, thank you (:"
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍
"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"
:) I’m proud of you dude :)
Prayers
Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Thank God for your life...
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
You are fucking amazing
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
Glad you're still with us!
You’re alive!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
Congrats!
You’re amazing.
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome.
