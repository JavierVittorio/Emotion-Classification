"OP, I apologize for what you are going through. This sounds painful and debilitating, physically, mentally, and emotionally. I just hope you pull through this."
"A very good friend of mine has this. She went through surgery to remove some of the very painful ones around her spine I think.   She made a 100% recovery, and she was 27 years old and a smoker/drinker.   You got this.  Edit (to add): I am saying she **was** 27 years old because this happened then. She **is** now 32."
"Thank you. I appreciate the kind words, internet stranger."
Thank you.
"Nobody can tell you how to feel but you. With that being said, fight like a motherfucker man. You’re in my thoughts G."
"Sounds awful, but I am hoping for the best outcome.  Fingers crossed for you bro."
"Thank you, I appreciate the encouragement."
Thank you bro.
You are very welcome. Please keep us posted :)
"Perhaps your friends are saying it's 'wrong' because they think they're trying to be strong for you when you're suffering, trying to give you their will to keep going, but don't know how to express themselves in a gentler way? I assume they're young, like you, and it's unlikely they've had to come to terms with anything approaching what you've been through. They lack the maturity that's been forced on you, but they care about you.  I hope your surgery goes well, and that things will improve for you.  Take care, friend"
"from a motherfucker who beat the odds, Godspeed OP. You got this."
"I will. I'll edit the post by next week if I'm still alive. If not, well, the post stays mostly the same ig lol."
You got this.
"I think you're right about my friends. Thank you for putting it into perspective (I hope I'm using that phrase right lol).  Thank you, and I'll take care. You too, internet stranger."
Thank you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
bro you got this. i believe in you.
Thanks homie.
"Hey, you got this. You're gonna be fine."
"You're in my thoughts. You got this today, tomorrow and every other day. Wishing you success!"
Thank you. I hope so.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
You will be.
Idk much about it bro but you got this man please update us I wish for the best bro🤙🤙
I'm praying for you and hope you make it through this without any issues.
Ty bro. Appreciate it.
"I'm sorry you're experiencing this, especially so young. That's not at all fair. I wish you a speedy recovery, and that you can have a normal life again.   There's also nothing wrong with making peace with the myriad of possibilities that could happen. With only a 20% chance of death though, I'd say the odds are in your favour. Good luck with your surgery OP!"
Thank you.
Hope to see you in a few years time on r/nextfuckinglevel squatting 315 for reps. You got this.
Best of luck!
"Hope you recover. Had a friend who died of leukaemia when we were both 14, many years have passed and I can assure you that you're way too young.  Best of wishes to you my friend, you'll do great."
"Thank you for all the kind word and wishes. I know it isn't fair, but life ain't fair for anyone.  Yes, there are so many things that could go right or wrong in this, so I might as well be ready for anything. Even though it's only 20%, well, you should see my luck at Monopoly and realise I am probably screwed lol."
I hope you find relief in whatever way possible. Good luck!
OP I’m sending you my best wishes for your speedy and safe recovery.  Stay strong 💪 you got this in the bag!
LMFAO. Thank you.
Ty (:
Thanks!
"You got this bro ! Please , update this post !"
Kick some ass bro😤
"I think/hope you'll most likely be alright, it sucks that you're young, but I think that also helps to improve your chances. However you're totally right, it's best to be ready for anything when things are out of your control."
"I'm so sorry for your loss. That's actually one of my biggest fears, making my friends too saddened if I die. So hopefully, I'll make it, and if not, hopefully they move on.  Thank you for the good wishes."
Your un my thoguhts and prayers.✊️
Good luck!!! I really hope the operation goes well!!!
I don't think it's wrong that you are accepting the fact that you might die. You aren't giving up you're just dealing with your reality. Your friends don't understand because they have never been in a situation like yours.   I wish you luck and I sincerely hope to see an update to this post
"Thank you, I appreciate it."
Smoke sum weed you got this
"I will if I survive. Set a reminder bot for 1 week lol. If nothing changes, well oof"

"Everything is going to be OK. Expect a prompt recovery, keep the faith I am not a believer I cannot pray but all my positive thoughts are for you! Hope to read here in the next days only good news from you!"
"I don't know what I can say that everyone else hasn't already said, but I am wishing you all the best. Sending positive, healing vibes your way. Please update us!"
It sounds like you are at peace and handling it in a healthy way. Sending blessings and good luck your way!
I hope you feel better. Tumors can be a fucking bitch but by god can you fuck them up. I believe in you
"Thank you! I'll update the post if I live. If not, oh well"
Roll the d100 instead of a D6 .. then you will only die on a 20 or below. &lt;3
Take time to rest and recover from your surgery. 80% is a hell of a good chance at survival. I'm sure you're in the hands of capable surgeons that will do everything in their power to keep you safe and alive.
"I probably have the same disease. When i was 15yo i had two biggest tumors removed, one from my arm and one from my leg. They were really big but in couple of days after the surgery i was slowly walking again. Today, more than 20 years later everything is still fine even though i have some more tumors left. After i stopped growing, they stopped growing. I guess what i am trying to tell you is to be brave and not give up. It will be better, you are stronger than the disease.   P.s. I'm not an english speaker so sorry for mistakes :)"
Thank you! I'll keep those vibes for recovery (if I make it there ofc lol)
"Just so you know it, I'm on my toilet seat and crying, I fucking love you man and I wish you the best, please give us an update after you had your surgery when you can. I believe in you and I wish you the best!"
I'm praying for you. You'll come out of this like a rockstar!
!remindme 1day
"You can do it my man,  I will pray for you  and your thoughts aren't really wrong persay, because it's your coping mechanism,  just believe in yourself and that you will live and don't worry about anything else because it doesn't matter,  I wish you a healthy recovery,  update once you are awake from the surgery"
"Lol, where the heck do I buy a d100?"
"It's fine to not be afraid of death. As someone with chronic pain problems, i can relate. Good luck on your surgery, i hope it doesn't make it worse at least."
I have an extremely strong feeling that you’ll be completely fine
Damn bro that sucks but hey like I said you got this with or without drugs your a strong human being.
"I don't think your mindset is inherently ""wrong"". It's just a pragmatic way to look at the situation, not suicidal. In any case, good luck OP"
"You got this bro, hope you'll pull through all of this 🙏🏾💜💜"
"Thank you, I appreciate it.   Now finish up your pooping session and continue your day lol"
"I’ve been where you are so many times. I feel you and I understand you. I have a non cancerous but potentially deadly brain tumor called an Arnold Chiari malformation. I had brain surgery on my cerebellum and upper spine and I died on the table 3 times. I then got an infection in the surgery site in my brain and ended up back in the hospital leaking csf out of my head and neck and fever of 105. I lived in horrible pain and seizures etc for 5 years before I was even diagnosed with doctor after doctor telling me I was crazy, depressed, a drug seeker etc. no one believed me. A neurosurgeon finally caught it on an mri and I had the surgery to remove the excessive brain tissue that had attached itself to my spine. But the damage was done and now the discs in my neck are crumbling so constant agony every day.  When I went in for the surgery there was a big chance of death or brain damage. I was so done with the pain already I honestly had no fear left of dying because all I could think was no more pain. I had 2 young kids at the time and everyone told me I was crazy and selfish. What about the girls, your parents, etc? But they didn’t have a clue what the last 5 years had been like or what the rest of my life I was going to be facing.   In the end though I did live and I am glad that I did because despite my pain I have had happiness and joy. I believe you are going to live. I wish you all the best and I fully understand where you are coming from."
"Thank you, I appreciate it."
I'm sorry for your pain little brother. I pray you get through this next surgery and your pain is less afterward. I don't know if your a believer but God has you my friend. You saying fates hands I hear faith in something greater. Let us know what you dream about afterwards because you will still be here.
THE FINAL COUNTDOWN  DUDUDU  DUDUDUDU
"Whatever your destiny is, you've inspired me with your strength and I think many others as well. I am wishing you the best possible outcome and I commend your bravery, sir."
"Wow, I don't know how to respond to this story. You've been through a lot comrade. I'm glad you lived, and I hope you're in less pain now.  Thank you for all kind words. I hope you're doing well."
"You're so young, and I'm so sorry that you've had to live like this.   You're a little badass no matter what happens 💜"
"More power to you young man, I know you'll make it through."
God is a sick bastard who loves watching children suffer and making people pray to him in order to heal them of the suffering he created.
Sorry to hear you're going through this. I couldn't imagine what you've been through.
Update us will ya
Dude you're metal as fuck. Good luck my guy
"Yeah, life gives you hard problems at times.  Thanks for the encouragement tho, appreciate it."
Hope you get better
You absolute badass. You got this my G
You absolute badass. You got this my G
You have my thoughts with you.
OP has his head screwed on and he knows his risks. Don't take that from him and claim he has nothing to worry about/he will be fine. You don't know that and it depends on so many factors. It's much more polite to keep your beliefs to yourself instead of being so insensitive.
Thank you. I hope it doesn't too.
This sounds like an awful way to go through life; wishing you a successful surgery and a full recovery!!! Sending you all the hugs! ❤️
!remindme 2d
Good luck to you friend either way....I have worked in many ORs directly with surgeons performing cases and have done some similar to what your are explaining.  I always place my hand on my patient once underway and say a little prayer for them to heal and be well.  Something I feel has been forgotten along the way...especially during surgical cases.
I hope stuff goes ok and you'll recover I think your really brave and have a great mindset for what's going on right now.   I have my fingers crossed that everything goes smoothly for you and the pain numbs after the surgery.
"You cant change what God/ the universe/ the simulation  has for you. If you learn this, you learn how to change yourself    I wish for you to have success in your procedure"
"This sounds awful and I cannot imagine what you are going through! But I believe in you! We believe in you! You will get through this, cause you are strong! You are in that 80%. Godspeed brother!!!"
"Thank you, I appreciate it!"
Your gonna be in my mind for the rest of the day I hope you feel much better don't forget to update us
It seems to me that you have a good attitude about the whole thing. Best of luck to you.
I hope it goes well
Modern medicine is a great thing. You'll get through this and wake up after surgery knowing that you'll be in a little less pain. Prayers to Apollo for you.

"Can you ask them to keep some of the bone they remove? That would be a wild souvenir to put on your shelf. Also, goes without saying, I hope you don’t die. But if you do and you want someone to haunt, I’m down."
Good to hear you have sone experience. I think that little prayer does do something to keep the patient alive. Just a bit of faith in whatever you believe in helps a lot.
"I will be praying for you, you will beat this. You will do this. Wish you all the best."
"Ah, a piece of rib on the wall. Sounds like a very good artefact.  Also, I'll be sure to jumpscare you at 3am if I become a ghost lol."
"Ty, I appreciate it"
I apologize... (Cultural differences) I only meant to help.. I understand...🙏🏻
"I've been in tons of pain for over a decade now. Sometimes as debilitating as you described. It sucks and is unfair. However, you seem to have found a clarity that is hard to find. That's good, imo. Accept your situation and roll with what you're given. Good luck with your operation and I really hope you gain mobility and relief. I really do."
i second this. all power to you. if theres an afterlife youll get a decent spot in it
You can do this.
"Thank you for the avid knowledge on dices. If I played DnD, this would be very useful info lol.  I'll probably pass this info to my nerdy friend lol, he'd appreciate it."

Ty!
"Hell yeah man, I’ll keep a light on for you so you can find your way hear. You can pass on info from the other side and I can spread your messages to the masses. We can eventually take our show on the road but will no doubt split due to creative differences, those of course being I make all the money and you don’t because, you know, ghosts can’t use human currency. BUT! If there is ghost currency, you will be golden!"
"I will comrade. If no update in a week, then oof. But hey, there's a good chance I'll live so yay"
"i’m so sorry you have this condition. with that said, no one knows your body like you do. so i understand where you’re coming from as my mom had fought breast cancer for 5+ years and she was just tired and was ok with dying. But she was 56 and you are 14. I really hope you do survive and have a wonderful recovery so you can live a full life you deserve. You are in my thoughts ♥️"
I dont agree with u.. But u are perfectly entitled to believe whatever u want...peace.. 🙏🏻
"Whatever will be, will be. But I appreciate that you shared your story, thank you, and I wish you the best for whatever direction your path turns to. You sound like a lovely human being and it's a pleasure to have got to know you, even if it's just a glimpse like that.  Be good 🤗"
"Good luck with the surgery.    I’ve had many many surgeries.  Some of them emergency surgeries.  Only issue I ever had was a drug interaction in the ER - where they gave me so much drugs I passed out.  You’re young, you’ll pull through this surgery."

My guy there's nothing wrong with not fearing death. And I'm glad your not neither. A lot of us shouldn't be but we are. I hope they are giving you something for the pain.   Keep us posted!
Hope everything goes well. You'll be in my thoughts today.
"Wishing you all the luck, you will pull through! Stay strong"
"Potentially dying at such a young age..- The fact that I'm younger then you by a year also makes me empathize, i couldn't even imagine how i would feel if this was going to happen to me at that age. Well just know that no matter what happens, everything will be okay. Us idiots on the internet are supporting you. If you survive the surgery, please update us on if it worked or not! Im sure many people along with myself would be interested to hear if you made it through and if the surgery had any effect. Im glad that you aren’t scared, and at least if this surgery doesn't go through, you will be at peace."
"I'm so sorry for you mother, but thank you for all the good wishes."
Good luck my friend. I hope things get better.
"Please update us, not immediately after the surgery obviously take your time and recover. But please update us eventually if you are able. You are on all of our minds."
"When I think my day is going bad, I remember that there is always somebody worse off than me. I wish you a speedy recovery and hope you get better. A life of pain is no life at all."
"There is nothing wrong about your feelings. Only someone who has been in your shoes knows what it is really like.   My nephew is 12. From the age of 1 he has had cancer, multiple times. This last time it’s braincancer. There isn’t anything that they can do. He has chosen to stop treatment and to wait for it to get so bad, that he can ask for euthanasia.   Some people say that he choose the ‘easy’ way. Or that we are monsters for letting him decide this. And that their opinion which they are free to have.  My point is, it’s your life. Those are your feelings and they are valid. I ofcourse hope that this surgery will give you many better years and that you’ll be able to walk again! Best of luck OP!"

"i could never emphasize with this since i’m so young and have never rly had any hardships in my life, but i think i get what you mean. sometimes you have to submit to the game of chance. you’re very mature for being able to cope with that. i hope that, no matter what happens, you’re able to continue to live and thrive"
"Good luck man, we're rooting for you!!!!"
"So I’m a biomedical engineer, and we’re often the ones who aid in the design for procedures like you’re going through. A big thing no one mentions about these things is that the averages are based on *everyone* who has had this done. The elderly, the morbidly obese, the immunocompromised, the addicted… everyone. If you’re a 14 year old (and believe me being young has *a lot* to do with how you recover and how much damage you can take. Like a monumental amount) then it’s entirely possible that you’ve got significantly better odds than 20%. And you’re ability to bounce back from this might even surprise you. I can’t tell you that it’ll all be okay, but I can tell you where I’d put my money. Good luck!"
"I had surgery that had 25% chances of killing me. It didn't and today I live a 95% normal life. You're already more strong than most people you know, with everything you lived.  Come back to tell us how it's been as soon as you can."

Take some of the time before the surgery to commit to yourself what you'll do when you wake up.  Life is a marathon and you're being given a rare moment to fully appreciate the fragility of your own life before you even hit 20.  It sounds as if you've already endured so much. When you wake up know you can take on anything. You got this.

Arnold chiari malformation is not a tumor. It is an issue with the skull being too small and the cerebellar tonsil squeezing into the space where the brain stem is situated. It causes problems when the brain stem becomes compressed. It is not a tumor.

I hope things improve from these surgeries. I understand why you're not afraid. I also didn't used to be afraid to die. But I'm afraid for you to die. I'm really scared. I am also scared of things not getting better for you. I'll be doing whatever version of praying I do.   You got this dude. Much love.
Few times I say this. But I hope you live a long and prosperous life.    I hate when disease takes people out.  It makes you feel powerless.
Good luck internet stranger
"Yes. Cheese is a very based edible substance, and should be accessible for all people"
I’m fine. I am also sorry because I didn’t mean to co-opt your story.  The thing I want you to take away is you have a right to your feelings and you are very brave.
Good luck
You got this. Here’s hoping for the best.
It’s not wrong. It’s how you feel. Your friends don’t have to live with what you do every day so they have no clue. There is no point in being afraid etc of dying in my opinion because it’s going to happen one day or another.   Good luck with the surgery and we will hear from you soon I am sure 🙂
Well that was wholesome af
"Sending you good vibes!  And I don’t think it’s wrong to feel okay about dying. Most people are scared by death but it is inevitable. Acknowledging that and being at peace with it is less stressful. Like you said, it’s in fates hands. Good luck on your surgery! Hope to see an update."
"Please update afterwards, if you can... I'm rooting for ya buddy. Stay tough:)"
"Ty, let's see if I live for an update"
your mindset is amazing i would be freaking the fuck out in that situation. good on you man and i hope it turns out amazingly
!remindme 5 days Good luck OP.
"You will be here to update, for sure!!!"
"We’re all pulling for you, OP. You got this!"
"Lol, I must live to see the sacred day"
"That was a perfect phrase, used correctly! You're young and strong. Fight like a MF! You've got this!!!"
"Please don’t try to explain my own disorder to me. Most people don’t even understand that the brain has tonsils let alone the structure of the brain, brain stem or spine etc. so it’s easier to just say it’s a non cancerous tumor since it’s effect on the body and brain are exactly the same as any other tumor you can get in that area. My neurosurgeon is the person who explained it to me that way and I think he probably knows what he’s doing.   I’ve lived with this all my life as I have post surgically for the last 22 years. I’m extremely aware of exactly what it is. I have an Arnold chiari malformation type 2 with spinal dimple in the bottom of my lumbar spine. I’m fortunate that I wasn’t born with an open spina bifida like most people with chiari type 2 but unfortunate in that my chiari is extremely severe including cranial deformities as well as sinus and inner ear.  Plus an oversized tongue and oral tonsils which I had to have removed at 17 when they got so big they started to grow together in my throat.  There’s nothing you can tell me about it that I don’t already know. I’m also a medical professional."
The absence of a fear of death is the presence of a full life. When you pull through I believe you’ll live a beautiful &amp; fulfilling life

No big inspirational speech just good luck and hope it all works out good for you x
"I think your perspective is healthy honestly. I wish you the best of luck and will be looking out for your update. You got this, OP."
"You got this brother, hope to see an updated post to say the surgery was successful!"
"Well, when there's no other options, you roll the dice and see where Lady Luck takes you. Get satisified, or at least used to all the options, and you have a 100% chance of happiness."
My friend do you know Jesus?
Accept whatever comes
"You will be, OP!"
"Hey man, I was not even remotely aware of this medical condition, I have only read your pain.  Sending you my best wishes.  Fight like a mf bro, you got this. All the best.   Don’t entirely agree with your friends, but that’s besides the point. You go bro. Win at this. Atb."
I wish you the best of luck with your surgeries. I hope they give you relief and allow you to walk comfortably.   When you have a chronic illness people do not understand your struggles. You have a very mature outlook that is also realistic. I give anesthesia for surgeries like yours. I deal with a lot of oncology patients. They’ve taught me a lot about how to look at life. Your friends just don’t understand and they are lucky to not have the same knowledge as you. You do what is best for you and kick some ass!
Stay strong dude were all rooting for you ♥️♥️
Stay strong dude were all rooting for you ♥️♥️
"Hope you absolutely windmill the bastard mate. Peace &amp; Love, Davey x"
For 14 years old to be going through this and speaking like you do is amazing. All power to you and best of luck with the surgery! You've got this pal 👍
Its ok for you to feel whatever you feel. Death in my point of view is just another part of life. You are level headed and I congratulate you for your strengh! I hope you will find peace living or dead. Is always a choice and you will see the truth. Living in pain is something people that are healthy dont understand...
"Yeah, I type well lol. Ty bro!"
People live on a lot worse odds so you never know.
"That acceptance of death but not actively wanting to kill yourself is something I share as well and my friends call me selfish for. If it happens it happens, if it doesn’t it doesn’t and life goes on.   It does not make you selfish, it makes you aware and in control. If you go then you’re leaving this world with grace and humility and you will be someone who is always cherished and loved by your family and friends. Death only hurts the living.   That being said, you’re one badass kid, no way in hell could I have been in your situation at 14 and had the ability to process it like you seem to be doing. You’ve got this, I can’t wait to see a new post in a couple of years talking about your life and the goals you’ve crushed :)"
"You're in my thoughts OP, kick this disease ass!"
Good luck! I hope everything goes well! 🙏🍀
"I am not suicidal, but I'm looking forward to the peace of death. I don't deal with as much physical pain as you, either."
!remindme 8 hours good luck OP!!
I hope you make it 🙏❤
"No one ever faces death or loss ‘right’.  There’s always *someone* who thinks they would have done it better or more appropriately.  I’m guessing your friend is unable to comprehend losing you or the concept of being ‘done’ with a certain aspect of life.  It doesn’t mean they’re right or wrong, it doesn’t mean you’re right or wrong, because no two people ever share the exact same experience for the exact same reasons, so everything else is just hypothetical and an attempt to gain control of something no human can control.  Good luck, either way."
We will hear from u again op... I know it.
"You’re going to make this out healthy and perfect, maybe look at this post years later and wonder what a rollercoaster life is. Your mindset about this entire situation is so remarkable, hoping to hear from you soon, friend ❤️ praying super hard for you somewhere on earth :”)"
You have the internet behind you. Go tackle this surgery and come back to let us know the good news.
"Thank you, I too hope peace will eventually come around."
"I’d say break a leg, but……   Instead I’ll say good luck. Your doctors know what they’re doing and you’ll be back on here posting updates in a week. Until then get the rest you need, spend time with your family and make sure to tell them you love them. You’re going to be ok."
I like this. Good luck OP!
Tell us if u die
"Dude, brother, भाई, I will spend today thinking and wishing you make a full recovery and overcome the pain and find that reason to want to be alive more. I give you my entire days' worth of thoughts.  Hope it helps"
Wishing you the best; good luck!
"Yeah, that's a good perspective to have. Thanks for the well wishes."
Tell us if u die

Hard to comment when ded bro 💀
"The strength you've displayed here as made a profound mark on me. I'll be thinking of you and sending all of my positive vibes. A virtual hug or, if you prefer, fistbump coming your way."
"If you go, I wish you nothing but peace and no pain ever again.   If you survive, congratulations! You owned the odds like a badass and you're officially a cyborg with metal bones. So cool."
yes eventually! is part of the journey... you are fine either way!
"Best of luck to you, you’ve got this friend 💛 sending every bit of good energy I can"
"Just tell your friend ""don't tell me what to do!"" :) You got this champ, let's fuck those tumors and get you up in 2 legs. Best of luck"
Bro you got this. Don't be afraid and stay strong and think about positive things and what you gonna do for your summer  I'm 16 butaway wish you luck 🫂🤝
Ty for the hugs *and* fistbump.
Your bravery comes from acceptance. Rarely have I met someone with such acceptance of their problems.  I have never been faced with anything like this. I hope I never am. If I am I will remember your bravery.  Wish you the best.
Yea but I believe in u
Remind me in 7 days!
hey no need to bring it here m8
"Hey OP, do not pay any mind to what you’re friends are trying to get you stressed about.   Focus on peace, you’re very young, and you’re also going through an extremely difficult time right now. Your mindset is a very sober and down to earth one for someone of your age.  Please keep us updated if you can, but do not feel any pressure to do anything that might over exert yourself. Okay? Just take this time for yourself. Do what YOU need to do. Be that meditating, chatting with family; whatever it is that helps you feel a bit better and maybe even puts a smile on your face.   I am so proud of you, even though I don’t know you. Just know, I’m rooting for your full recovery and happiness ♥️  Sincerely,  A random internet mom"
"You got this OP, you’re going to kick ass today 🙏♥️"
Remind me!
Stay positive because its the best thing for your body. You've got this dude now go kick its ass and continue to be an epic person. Big love from an old dude in England!
The way you are thinking isnt wrong and honestly i can't blame you. I wish i does help you though because constant chronic pain sounds like a nightmare
"I really hope it’s a success and you can begin a road to recovery that lasts a lifetime. You’re far too young to die and seem like a level headed young man. The world needs more people like you in it, good luck 🤍"
"Best healing wishes, crossing fingers and all 🤞"
"Im pulling for you, you got this!"
"There's nothing wrong with feeling okay with death.  Technically,  it will solve all your problems"
Kick it's ass. Sometimes you need to look the devil in the eye and fight. You got this. Stay strong and live on.
"""Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die... [A man] can only get away from death by continually stepping within an inch of it. A soldier surrounded by enemies, if he is to cut his way out, needs to combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness about dying. He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will not escape. He must not merely wait for death, for then he will be a suicide, and will not escape. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine."" - GK Chesterton"
"Yes, I will upgrade my body to max stats as a cyborg lol"
"If you have 20% of dying,then you also have 80% of surviving. That’s how you should be seeing this. Good luck hon."
Will be thinking of you
I’m sorry for all the pain you are in. You are a very brave young person. I wish you the best and am thinking of you.
Hoping for the best outcome for u brother
Ty (:
Facing death without fear it's a commodity I too want to have.
You’re too tough to die kid. Remember to always smile brother! You’ll pull through. Please dont hesitate to give us any updates!
Good on you. There's nothing out there to be afraid of in death. It all lives here on earth with us.
You are a fucking soldier my man you got this
"Good luck king and since it seems you made up your mind, let’s leave it to fate."
"Thanks, I'll keep my smile on no matter what. And let's hope I'm here to give an update lol"
"There is nothing wrong with accepting things you have no control over. This was the same mindset I had when going to war, acceptance that death was a possibility. No one wants to die, it's not suicidal, it's not homicidal, or crazy. You just understand something at an earlier age that most people don't realize until they are elderly. I get it, that same understanding got me through a lot of rough deployments in the military, and in all honesty has helped me live a better life. Hope things go well today."
"I just hope that it doesn't make it worse, that's objectively the worst thing that could happen.  Live or die, I hope you get your freedom."
"It’s not wrong, and I know your friends care for you deeply, it can be hard to express one’s emotions especially faced with a situation like this, coming to terms can take time, especially with a person you care deeply for.   It’s okay to be okay with dying. I’ve always said, it is what it is and there is nothing we can change to put us on a different course in life. While there are things we can change in life, some things we can’t. And that’s okay.   Wishing you all the best. Good luck. ❤️"
To battle we go!
"It is difficult for a healthy 14 year old to fathom the concept of dying. You have lived with this and your mind, body and soul are far more mature in the category of mortality. One day, your friends will understand. I hope you are there with them when they do.  I remember my 12 year old son walking down the hall to surgery. I heard huge bouts of laughter from the room. He was telling jokes to the medical team as they got him ready. I was so proud of him (minor surgery, he's fine!)  We are wishing you the best."
Trust the process brother. I have faith that you’ll be alright. Good luck.
Positive thoughts coming your way. You got this.
That's sounds horrible dude stay strong. It is your willpower that'll determine you. All the best.  I hop this comment will cheer you up a bit :)
"Thanks, I appreciate it."
Good luck my dude. Godspeed
You’re going to beat the odds op!
"If you go in for surgery and suddenly find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium."
Good luck bro I hope you make it man
Good luck to yoy sir!

"I can’t imagine living how you’ve been living, I wish you the best of luck and I hope all things go according to plan. You still have a whole life ahead of you. Good luck with the surgery my fellow redditor."
"Fuck today in the ass, and make it your bitch. You’ve got this ❤️"
Keep your head up my guy! Fight that fight! Once you chose to give up that’s when you lose! If you keep fighting with everything in you! You will win no matter what!
You got this CAP!’ Let’s go

"I hope to do what your 12 year old did, joke and smile before we enter the battlefield. He's definitely a role model for me. Thank you for the story"
"Well, good luck is all!"
u got this
i look forward to your update from the recovery room OP :)
God Speed Child.
Saying a prayer for you right now. May you be strong through this horrible disease and have a full  recovery ❤️‍🩹
20% is actually pretty low. It seems high but unless fate decides your run is over then you'll be just fine. Godspeed
I understand not being afraid of dying as I’m not afraid myself. I wish you a full recovery and that the surgery is successful to alleviate all of your pain. Give us an update once you’re good. Hugs and healing vibes your way!
"Honestly, love the mentality around it. You got this king, all be fine."

"Make sure you spend this time in the best way you can think of. Also, please try to blink for as long as you can after you die (if you indeed do die) there is a theory that you can do certain things for up to 15 minutes after cardiac arrest. I'm sure the doctors would appriciate if they got to do some research on your dieing body. (Most prominently EEG) also, have you considered donating your organs in case of death? Thank you for sharing what might be your last time alive. I do wish you survive for longer and also best of luck to you."

"Hi, I am an orthopedic surgeon in western PA. I am sorry to hear about your situation, however your odds of dying are far less than 20%, less than 1% actually unless there is something you’re not telling us?  2 ribs and even a full knee replacement is very safe. Good luck to you"

Wish you nothing but the best!  You got this OP!

It's not weird to not be afraid of death. After living with constant pain it sounds nice to just not hurt.   Good thoughts to the surgery making a difference.
I hope the best for you. I admire your realistic attitude towards a truly fucked up situation. Stay strong.
You got this champ! Good luck.

You are so brave and calm.  I admire your strength.  Hope everything goes well. 💕💕💕💕
Let us know!
Thinking of you.  I hope for the best possible outcome and wish I faced my situations as bravely as you are.  You're stronger than steel.
Godspeed.
We're all rooting for you buddy
I’ve died. Let me know if you need advice.   Good luck
I hope the surgery goes well and that you make a fast successful recovery. You are a very well spoken young man and seem smart as hell. I don't believe your time is up just yet. Stay strong bro ❤
"Most of luck to you OP, i'll be thinking of you."
Keep your head up kid!! Don’t go down without a fight homie!!
"Na you're good I've gone through a couple high risk surgeries and have a high risk condition. I decided young I wasn't going to let it change the way I want to live. I just accepted I'd probably be dead by 25. Im 25 now and half way to 26 now and just treat every day like a gift. There's no reason to be afraid of death when every day hurts, and there's nothing wrong with risking death to try and reduce the pain. Just live with no regrets"
Good luck. Stay strong. And give someone your reddit stuff(preferably in your family) Incase the worst happens to let us know.
"Good luck kid, you sound tough as hell.   We’re all rooting for you!"
"Well, if my chance of death is less, then great. But my docs are saying the odds are high due to blood loss and other factors. I can't really say what other factors are in play, as my Mum and surgeons handle most of my medical stuff lol. I'm just here to rant before the surgery.  Wish I could tell you more, bur I legitimately am unsure about it."
Good fucking luck. I sincerely hope you make it.
"Good luck. I have nothing but respect for you, a 14 y/o who isn’t letting fear rule their life. I hope everything goes well for you, sending thoughts &amp; prayers"
"""But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you.

"Hello op, I am 27 and I have your same condition. Up in-till this point in my life I have had 16 surgery to correct the damage that has been done by these multiple hereditary exostosis. I have a rebuilt hip, because there was a tumor growing inside my hip that was giving me back pain. I have had something called an external fixator (don’t google it) put on my knee. This was to correct growth. My surgeon had to remove tumors that were entangled in nerve behind my knee. I still don’t particular walk right.  Once you get to the point were they stop growing you can live a relatively normal life. Best of luck and don’t think to much about the percentages of the surgery that will drive you insane."
"Even though you have excepted fate as is please do fight to live, you are so important to everyone here and we love you. You got this op. :,)"
Sending you strength and well wishes 🤞🏻  You got this 💪🏻
I can’t imagine what you go through on a day to day basis.  I really have no other words to say other than I wish you the best and hope that this surgery can grant you some relief.  Best of luck to you!
Praying for you 🛐 We need an update though.
"I will hope for the best and that will make a good recovery soon. No one can tell you how to feel, but i think not being afraid of death is what will give you the strength to push forward and have no regrets. You got this😊😊"
You fukin got this man
"Holy crap, more power to you... Hope you make it out alive and better than ever."
"That’s 80% survival my friend. I had the same chances for my stemcelltransplant and it was rough but once you’re on the other side, it will feel like the best thing you could have ever done."
"I totally get ya. I live with chronic pain. You have my sympathies. For people who don't live with chronic pain there is no way to describe what our lives are like. We power through most days, and live with the shaming by many people. My base pain level is also 5. Some days, it is 8 or 9. It has worsened my anxiety. I have days where I cannot get out of my bedroom, much less my house. The anxiety is paralyzing.  I truly hope you get some relief. I am on.my way to my neurosurgeon's office. I had a spinal stimulator implanted,  and it has definitely helped lower my pain levels. Not completely,  but enough to where I can somewhat function. That's a huge blessing 🙌!!!"
Hope you do well
"I’m blown by your level of maturity for your age. Your friend has no right to tell you how you should or shouldn’t be feeling. I personally think you’re very brave &amp; wish more people shared the level of courage that you have. You sound to me like a fighter, you’ll make it out of surgery just fine, keep us posted."
"I will try it before the surgery, thank you very much"
I’m so sorry OP I really hope you make it through
See you on the other side mate
"Wish you had a vibranium skeleton bro, all the best"
Hope you make it to the other side and this is but a small speed-bump along your life's journey! Sending positive energy your way!!
"Don’t listens to your friend, they don’t know what they’re talking about. There’s no better place to be than at peace with things that are out of your control."
Good luck!
"I hope you end up in less pain. I understand you not caring if you die. I’m there with you, I don’t have a suicidal thought in my head, but I don’t really understand the need to prolong life. My time is my time and it will end when it ends. I’ve discussed this with my family and they think I’m crazy. I once told them I will never get chemo, if I get cancer it will heal or I will die. I will not poison myself to live longer. Makes no sense to me."
Hi there- I have the same disease.  Hoping your surgery goes smoothly. I have several family members that have had successful surgeries.
I will comrade. Thank you for the kind words.
"You got this pal, we are all rooting for you"
Damn.. Just as old as me...
"Aye, us bone-growth buddies must stick together."
Maybe have the doctors lace them bones with adamantium while they’re choppin it up in there
"fuck, these kinds of posts are the ones that make it so I a cannot read and simply scroll. You got this and we are all thinking of you."
You are brave and strong
"Ty, I appreciate it."
"You sound incredibility mature and level headed for your age. I hope you make it through your surgery and beat the odds, I hope you find relief. I’ll be thinking of you. You are strong!"
Bless up and stay positive
I wish you the absolute best in a successful surgery that gives you a great quality of life!
Sending good thoughts of healing to you !
Ty
Seems so unfair for someone your age to be going through this type of thing. I hope they can fix you up and you can live pain free. Stay strong King.
"Best of luck, my thoughts are with you."
"Hi, I'm a Buddhist and also suffer from a lot of pain from a disease that's not cureable. The thing is I have been reading quite a lot of Siddhartha Buddha's writing and that disease are NOT caused by karma! It's part of living, sickness, old age, and death(the four Noble truths)are all part of life. No one can actually do anything to change those! YOU have an amazing thought process and are practicing the truth of life! Worrying about death is pointless! I get all you said and understand completely! I'm not suicidal either. I accept the Noble truths! Try to realize THEY ARE AFRAID of death. Thank you for posting and I hope you are helped by this surgery. When it's over and you want to post a follow-up, I will be here to cheer you!"
We'll see you again in several hours. Surgeons are pros and you'll be up and about shortly.
Love and support my man
I know what that’s like. There’s a surgery that could fix my pain. But it’s risky. I’m underage so I can’t talk about it without freaking my mother out. But there’s nothing wrong with not caring at this point. A lot of people don’t understand that a 5 for some people is much more painful then a 5 for others. I hope it goes well. If it doesn’t I hope you’re at peace.
I love you man. Sending good vibes.
"If you're going to die, here is a couple of useless facts:  Netflix was available in the PS2 (PlayStation 2) in a CD Installer, but weirdly enough, it was only available in Brazil.   There are a couple of possible reasons for this, but my personal theory is that a lot of companies like to use Brazil and other ""Third World Countries"" as test subjects for updates and alternative versions of their products, so if it works they can release it to the rest of the world.  But the funny thing is, to access Netflix you had to have access to a fast internet connection. And at the time the PS2 was popular in Brazil, the internet was a baby here,  extremely expensive and usually not know as something useful. So if Netflix did that as a test, it wouldn't produce realistic results of success in comparison to the United States for example...  Most users of the PS2 were kids, so they didn't even knew the PS2 had Ethernet Port. Hell, till today some of us didn't know what were the USB ports supposed to do...    Going back to my theory, it's backed up by the fact that most important and polemic updates for social media apps are firstly introduced in Third World Countries, like Brazil.  Remember that update Instagram had a couple of years ago that removed the ability for people to see the likes in posts? That was firstly released here in Brazil for a couple of months, then later released (with bug fixes) to the general public.   So yeah... I hope you make it mate : )"
"Sorry for what you're going through but you are a badass. I truly hope the best for you and while I think it's fine to confront/find peace in the chance of death, I know you haven't given up yet. Hopefully you make it perfectly"
"You’re gonna get through this, OP!"
U/Captandew12 i hope u the best &amp; i would ask the docs for a double knee replacement if they could. Also what's your body fat ratio. &amp; muscle  mass ratio &amp; you will get through this also see if they can replace your digits on your hands with an organic  plastic. Best of luck when you go under.
you got this i know you can get through this &lt;3
"Good luck, all the best"
You have my prayers with you brother. Stay strong.
You got this brother 💪💪
Best of luck OP. If you're there tomorrow i'll give you some fun facts about the stub-nosed anteater.
Fight like hell. Never go gentle.
You will be fine.
"Thank you bro, I appreciate it"
You'll be back here posting very soon. Godspeed.
I think your attitude makes sense. I'm sorry you have this condition. Good luck to you.
Sending you SO much love and I'm so sorry you're going through this! You got this!! Praying for a great surgery for you and hope to see you edit this post later on this week!!
I hope it all works out to the best of the possible outcomes.
I pray for you mate 🙏
"you’re so badass, that’s all I’ve got to say."
"Ty bro, I appreciate it"
"Wishing you the best of luck OP, and i hope you make a quick recovery!"
Danke
Sending you love and wishing you good luck and a speedy recovery!   Keep us posted! 💗💗💗
"Oh wow. Best of luck to you, OP!"
I hope you don’t die. Ever.
"Wow, where to start!  You're inspirational to begin with and I say this for many reasons.  1) You're a teenager. 2) You're 14. 3) You're amazing.  I don't agree with your friends. Just because you have come to peace with something doesn't mean you're ill, psychologically torn or suicidal. Quite the opposite can be true of course.  However, I have some knowledge in this as a dear friend of mine passed due to this. However, his circumstances were FAR different and I feel I'm on a timer here!  You, I have little to no doubt will come good and we all here EXPECT (🙂) an update from you in the coming days.  Stay strong. You are truly inspirational and we need you, the world needs and wants you.  So much love to you 🥰"
"Omg, this is sad, but you'll pass through this. Please, update your succesful cirurgy for us. Good luck!!! Everything is gonna be ok."
♥️ You got this. ♥️
♥️ You got this. ♥️
Hey. I got love for you OP. Praying for you.
"I think your friends are just going through a tough realization that you yourself have probably have thought about at greater length . I feel the same towards death I obviously care if it’s going to be painful ,but I’m not scared of it and if it happened tomorrow my only thoughts would be I’d hope my kids would be okay and I am in no way near your situation it’s just I’ve had a lot of death happen around me if anything I think it is a very real and healthy outlook it doesn’t have to be scary.   I don’t pray ,but you’ll be in my thoughts and I’m hoping for great results from this surgery for you ❤️"
May the force be with you always!

Ty bro! (:
Are you at peace with the Lord?

"Take care m'guy, I'll pray for your recovery. I hope you get well soon man, godspeed"
What does the 20 percent actually mean? Does it mean out of 5 people 1 always dies?
"Hey,   You're going to come out of your surgery alive. Once you're healed you're going to feel less pain and be so much happier.  I'm sorry this is a part of of your journey."
I GOT NO WORDS BUT YOU GOT THIS MAN!!!
"I’m in awe of your resilience and your healthy outlook on it all. You got this, OP. I’m rooting for you and sending healing thoughts and positive vibes your way 💖"
"Good luck, sending prayers your way! 💖"
Best of luck brother. See you on the other side.
I hope u make it through。u r 14 and thats too young.
"I'm very sorry that this is happening to you.  Never be ashamed of an acceptance of death.  It is something we all face, and too many fear. You are awesome, and I hope that this goes well. With your permission, I will pray for you."
You got this see you on the other side God willing.
I wish you luck my friend and am praying for the best outcome! I beat the odds once and believe you will too.
"It’s hard for someone healthy to understand that there are fates worse than death.  That said, I truly hope that you continue to endure and that this surgery, and whatever others in the future, allow you to enjoy a pain free life.   Much love and best wishes to you:)"
"Sometimes it’s okay to be okay with dying. Life hurts, made by what has happened to us in or out of our control. If you’re sick, life is harder. At least you’re not crippled by the overwhelming fear of dying, that’s an upside."
i believe in you
"Oh kiddo! I’m betting on you. The odds are in your favor. You’re young. You sound like you are really resilient.  I know this is scary, but mechanical engineer person is optimistic and I trust her/his judgment. Your friends have no business telling you how to feel, but they’re scared for you. Please let us know how you’re doing. I’m holding you in my thoughts."
No idea. I'm just saying what my docs and mum said.
Please keep us posted!! Im sure you'll get better! Sending all my love and best wishes 💗💗💗💗💗

Very sad. I have no idea how it feels to be in your situation. But the pain I felt for you reading your post was overwhelming. I have a 15 year old boy. If he was going through what you are going through my heart would break. My heart breaks for u . I hope your surgery has the best possible outcome and that your pain is relieved.
Good luck i hope everything works out
More powers to you !You are stronger than you think you are .Hope the surgery goes successful.Keep us posted !

"Hi I just want to say that I'm 54 and was diagnosed with HME at the age of 2. In my case I've got it very severely and have had numerous bones (growths) removed. I live in the UK and its a constant battle with doctors for them to understand the pain that comes with this genetic disease.    I'm not sure of your age op but I found that overtime my pain threshold increased particularly once I left my teenage years. I won't pretend that living with the condition is easy because it's certainly not. However state of mind and the mental strength of working through the pain is very important.  The  concerns around my operations was damage to nerves near the removal of the growths .   Although there is always a risk in having any surgery I found the risk of death to be no higher than any other surgery. Honestly the removal of the growths can take a while in your post op recovery. However with good physio care you are more than likely to make a full recovery.  Please attack the recovery period with a positive mind set, not an easy ask I understand that because let's be honest at times you'll feel how unfair life can be for having this condition because very few people really understand it.   What I'm really trying to say is that you can lead a normal life within reason. Good luck with the operation and if you want any more information on the condition please pm me . You've got this 👍"
I’m sending positive vibes. I know you will make it out alive. Have hope and faith. You are so young. You mostly likely have a higher chance to make it.
I have faith in you young man. You got this!
I wish you and your family all the very best.
"Please update us as soon as you can afterwars, I wanna know how your doing. You got this champ"
You can do this OP. You are in my thoughts.
You got this!
"Praying for you man, I wish u luck"
Brother may you have a speedy and successful operation and the fact that you can stay so clam during a time like this shows you’re an enlightened soul and encourage you to think about a YouTube channel sharing the story and your ability to overcome. God speed bro
It is misinformation to call it a tumor. It is not. Sry this is a topic close to my own heart as well. A real medical professional would not call chiari a tumor. I am a nurse. Not dismissing your experience. Just not misleading people to believe chiari is a tumor.
Prayers
"Good luck, I will pray for you 🙏"
"Yeah, my mother is also very distraught from my illness. She seems sad a lot more since I got diagnosed. But I hope with the surgery, everything will be fixed."
"You know what, I had the same attitude when I had to have surgery 10 years ago. Anytime they put you all the way under, there’s a risk of death. I feel like you’ve got a pretty good attitude. It’s OK to be OK with dying. It’s a lot more peaceful, and less scary when you have to go into surgery. That doesn’t mean you want to die.    Obviously one wants to avoid getting too comfortable with death or the prospect of dying, but that doesn’t sound like your situation."
I think your surgery it will be a succces…and you will be able to walk again and enjoy life…good luck… Take care! Keep us posted!
YOU GOT THIS.
"Unlucky at Monopoly, lucky at surgery. This is a universal truth."

Hey man I am wishing you the very best &amp; hoping for 100% recovery.
"Wishing all the best for you and your family, man. Godspeed"
We hope you make it and all goes well
"All the best OP, stay strong."
"Cheers bud. You're too young to have to deal with this shit, but you've got a great attitude about it. Hoping all goes well for you."
"My old roommate and one of my best friends has MHE. He’s had fourteen surgeries so far, I believe, one of which was done on his upper spine… and all have been successful. He is 35 now. I believe in you and your ability to pull through. You got this, stay strong!"

You are the captain of your own soul. I wish you only the very best of luck.
"You got this , you goddam champion , this easy work for you !!!!"
"Stay solid, you got this! Wishing you the best!"
"Ty comrade, I appreciate it! And from this thread, I'm surprised how many ppl have MHE lol"
"I think you got this--20% chance of death is actually quite common with surgeries, I understand this of course (ribs) is a bit more in depth but with *any* anesthesia you could die, even a common surgery--laproscopy, dental, etc. can have killer effects.   I am very understanding of your feeling towards life and death; I think you are more-so at peace with either outcome which is tremendous for any of us to face and conquer; hope to hear a full recovery/update from you later!! Wishing you a painless recovery and many more healthy years of kicking butt!"
"I believe in you. I know people who've had this disease, you can get through this and just know, we know you can do this. Best of luck, OP"
"I’m so sorry about what you’re going through. Stay strong OP , we all believe in you and we know you’re coming back stronger and braver. Take care, bud."
"Good luck brother, you've got this."
Well wishes from a total stranger. You sound dope.
Good luck.  You will be in a crap ton of pain after the surgery but if you are always a five anyways you should be good.  The ribs....  ouch.

I’ll be waiting for your update post OP!! I know you’ll be just fine :)) I’ll be praying for you
"It’s not bad to not be afraid don’t listen to that, but you’ve got this man. Goodluck bro!"
"My thoughts and prayers are with you op, it's all going to be okay"
completely agree! it's as much to do with science as it is mentality; having a strong mind set is tantamount.
"Ty, I appreciate it (: And yeah, surgeries generally always have risks."
Prayin for ya buddy
You got this!
You are allowed to feel however you want about death. We are all entitled to an opinion even if others have a different opinion.
You got this. Your fearlessness will help you heal extra fast.
"Yeah, the ribs is the worst pain. Hope it'll end after the surgery."
"I don't know if you believe in God but I'm praying for you and I hope you'll make it out ok. It's also not weird to have peace with what's happening, good for you!"
"As someone who is back in school for engineering, this is super inspirational. Thank you so much for everything you do. You’re amazing!   And OP, as this person said, your surgery is going to go great. Good luck! We are all rooting for you!"
Best of luck
Being at peace with yourself and the world around you is something to admire. I hope you have a successful surgery and quick recovery.
"You're not wrong for being unafraid of death.  I'm sorry your life has been this painful, and I hope this procedure helps you."
"if you remove two ribs just dont replace them, way more fun that way"
You are a genius.
Ty
All the very best. Said a prayer for you
"I cant imagine what are you going through now but i trust you, get well soon brother just stay positive and hope everything will be positive."
you got this! the universe will protect you. it will. you got this. I bet you got this.
Surgery I and of it self can be scary and as a person that delt with excruciating pain for 8 years till I was finally able to find the cause and have surgery I know your pain and the corresponding feeling of if it works great but if it doesn't I'll manage and if I die I die.  Sadly my issue was a plethora of incompetent doctors that led to my prolong suffering and a simple surgery to correct it. I pray the best possible outcome for you.
Hope all goes well and better than anyone thought it could go. Prayers to you&gt; Keeep us updated.
Praying for you! You got this 🥰
I believe in your strength 💙💗🖤
General kenobi! Cough cough
nothing more badass than staring death in the face and keeping your nose up. the kind of courage you dont expect to see in a 14yo. wish I had the balls you have at 14.
"Dear stranger, I hope you'll be fine and the doctors will get rid of those tumours.   Don't lose hope!"
!remind me 7 days
Best of luck brother. Pulling for you!
I’m in a similar situation and I’m also not afraid. It’s okay to not be afraid.
It’s understandable to want the pain to stop. Living with chronic pain is hard emotionally as well as physically. Keeping you in my thoughts for healing and no more pain.
Hoping for the best for you. May you recover and have a beautiful life ahead.
You're an incredibly brave young person. I wish you the very best.
You can beat these odds dude. Praying for you.
"Good luck buddy, here’s hoping you come out of this stronger❤️"
All the best of luck OP!
"Boys over in r/stoicism would love your perspective on death. Not only is your perspective not bad, it an ideal that everyone of us should try to reach with their our own mortality. Good on you. Wish you good luck on your procedures."
I'll be thinking of you. Good luck
"Stay strong my man. A soldier in the face of enemy fire should be calm and prepared, just like you. I feel better knowing that there are still brave boys around. Be assured that almost everyone that read what you've written are proud of you. You are one the best of our kind courageous kid!"
"I don’t think it’s weird for you to feel ok about dying. I’ve been in a near death situation and felt the exact same way.  Stick with that attitude of “accept the way things are, work f***ing hard to get better” and you’ll be fine. Everyone (including me) thought I would be in a wheelchair forever and now I can run. You can do it too.  You got this."
You got this for sure. I can only imagine that you're a strong soul :) peace brother ☮️✌️
Sending you good thought. Man you are a straight warrior and I m pulling for you!
"It's a weird world man. And it isn't fair nor kind. But I am glad I got to read this because your strenght and attitude here is genuinely admirable and inspiring, you are a beautiful person and I hope that you survive."
God bless
"Ty for showing me the odds just might be better than expected. Still, best to prepare for everything aye."
"Anytime! I do know he’s a part of a few MHE support groups if you’d be interested in something like that and aren’t already. I’m sure he’d be more than happy to share. You’re all incredibly strong for living with this condition; I lived with him for four years and I saw the toll it took. I don’t blame you in the least for your thoughts on the matter, but hope you are able to walk after your recovery. I’m going to go ahead and be your optimist and request you update us *when* you’re feeling well enough post-op :)"
It's been an hour so far
"better yet, you got more guts than i have right now (22M)"

Look death in the face &amp; spit in its eye. Proud of ya kid. You got this.
"Good luck man. Wishing you the best, for all the good that does. Nobody deserves to deal with that shit, least of all at your age."
I don’t know you but I will be thinking of you and praying for you. My whole heart goes out to you. 😢
"Very sorry you’re going through this OP, but you got this."
"Hope everything goes well, sending thought's &amp; prayers, come back safe.👍"
"Andrew,   Please make a post-surgery post when you awaken from it. You have a heart of steel and a soul filled with fire, the fact that you are not afraid. I will be thinking about you all day today. I don't know you nor will we ever meet, but know that there are those out there who will be here for you along the way."
Good Luck!  Be positive. :D
"You got this young warrior!! You have accepted what MAY be, just make sure you accept what WILL come when you wake!! Live it to YOUR best!! Good juju/thoughts/prayers kiddo!! ❤️💪"
i hope the surgery goes amazingly well!!!!!
Good luck dude. Nothing but respect. Looking forward to seeing you post again.
Good luck to you. I hope you come out better!
"I hope the surgery is successful and you recover from this, and be able to enjoy life at it's fullest. Everything will be okay. If you die you will leave us all here disappointed, but at least we know that you are in peace. I'm not religious or anything but I hope that god or whatever that is, it stays with you. We will be waiting for news. Don't leave us hanging."
Real shit. I am sending strength your way my friend. We will see you soon!
You friend don't understand that death is less scary and easiest to deal as constant pain/agony. I hope it will be a success and that your pain decrease. Tell us maybe afterwards how it goes
"You can always freeze yourself until the year 3000. I hear they have a cure for ""boneitis"". Just don't get distracted by some weird delivery company."

"What a great comment. Hey Op, listen to this guy. :)"
Adamentium?
You got this. Let's fucking go!!
I was 100% sure I was dying for a full hour. I didn't think I'd be afraid either. I was.
You can do this!
"I'm rone to have polyps on my bowels which basically means that they are little tumors in your bowels that if not removed can cause cancer. I have this big surgery that even removed a bit of of my bowels and had to have reconstructive sphincter. I wish to no one, not even my worse enemg the pain I was in for 2 years and half while I was healing. Worse pain ever. They told me it will eventually come back or not. Well this was on 2008. I think they're back (same symptoms) horrible stomach pains and other nasty symptoms. I'm due to a colonoscopy next month.  But that pales in comparison to your pain. I truly hope the surgery go well and that you can walk again and have a bit less pain on the long run. If anyone deserves less pain is you."
We'll be waiting for you sir
Thinking of you xxx
Ah let's hope that's true comrade.
"Everything is nothing, and nothing is everything."
!Remindme 1 week
I think the fact that you're not afraid of the death shows  tremendous courage. And I also imagine it gives you a sense of peace and serenity. Sending you lots of positive vibes. God speed my friend.
May God bless you with a full recovery. I will pray for you
Good luck
Best of luck my friend 💪
"In a really shitty way of thinking…You are gonna feel so much better soon, either way!!!"
"Make sure you come back and tell us how things went once you come out of it. I got faith that you'll be ok. 14yo is super young and you've got a lot of life left to live. Even folks who are wheelchair bound are still able to find their passions in life and are able to be genuinely happy. Stay strong, my young friend. There's clearly a bunch of us here rooting for you!"
accepting death is one of the best things you can do when faced with ones own mortality. you are incredibly brave and the peace given after coming to those terms is otherworldly.   hoping the best for you op ❤️
We'll be waiting for you sir
"As someone who survived a very traumatic accident 5 years ago with very small “5% chance of survival” I’m telling you, YOU GOT THIS!!! We are much stronger than we are lead to believe.

Sending love your way kiddo. You got this.
Sending positive vibes your way OP I hope you awake to a pain free life
"When the night falls, take solace in the coming of dawn. Stay strong, friend."
"Good luck, man. I am sure you'll be fine. I just hope your life goes back to normal, if you ever had a normal one. My heart aches for people having to go through such things."

"Good luck man, wish u the best"
"It's absolutely okay to be accepting of your potential death.  What your friends said is what I'd call a ""them"" problem.  I have a lot more I could say on the topic but it doesn't really matter.  The only one that needs to be okay with what's happening is you.  Good luck in there!"
Yeah you’ll be wildly fine. It is WAY better that you go through this now at 14 when you’re strong. Imagine 65/75? That’s when id worry.
Good luck son
"All the light and love of the universe to you my friend, make peace however you must but I am hoping for the best outcome for you ✨🌠✨"
"It's not wrong to not fear death.    Also, DRs are usually wrong about how long someone has to live. I was given 6 months.   That was 22 yrs ago."
"What a horrible disease to have, and I thought ms was bad. I completely understand your statement about dying. I too am not suicidal but also would be ok with it if something happened. I pray that is not the case though and you are going to get through this and live your life, walking. All the very best my friend."
Ty ❤
Heartbreaking post and all I can offer is well wishes and a speedy recovery. I don’t know adversity like you’re going through but I cannot explain enough how having a positive attitude works. We are all soldiers fighting different battles. You have got this because you’re a champion x
YOU GOT THIS!
"I hope you get trough it man, there is a lot of things you need to experience first !"
"I wish you the best. My problems, which seemed monumental five minutes ago, now seem trivial. I'm happy for you that you are able to face your upcoming surgery with peace. Good luck."
"!remindme 24 hours   Edit: I'm back bitch. /jk   Anyways, good to see you made it!"
Good luck. Nothing more.
Did you reach this contentedness with death through the pain of your illness or through some other form of philosophy or self exploration? I'm relatively well as far as I'm aware and death terrifies me.
There’s nothing wrong with not being afraid to die. It means you accept for fate. Good luck brother
Nobody can tell you what you feel and they probably never felt the pain you feel rn. Fingers crossed everything will be alright with you man. If the surgery goes right remember to never give up and keep going forward even if you feel like there's nothing you can do. You got this!
Thinking of you man.
"As we all know, a group of Crows is called a murder. I like taking pictures of just 2 crows hanging around, I call these photos ""attempted murder"" ... makes me laugh, hope you did too"
I’ll be thinking of you 🖤
"You are a brave soul, my dear. I admire your strength and poise after years of living in such pain. From the bottom of my heart, I hope this surgery makes a huge difference in the quality of your life and you have many more years to share your brave story with others. You’re an inspiration and I know, your beautiful soul will forever live on. 🤍"
"Don't know what to say,but you're solid. You'll be alright no matter where you go"
I cant imagine what you're going through.  I truly hope this goes well.
"Being at peace with death is stoicism. In Latin, there are two mottos  Momento Mori   Amor fati  The first means ""Remember death"" which helps place us in perspective. Amor fati means ""love fate"" No matter what life is, appreciate where you are/who you are.   Together, no matter who you are and how you have it, there is an end. Appreciate things accordingly.   As humans, our entire existence has been boiled down to taking chances. The very spirit of humanity is one of survival and adaptability. So, Momento Mori, but today isn't your day.   Please update us when you've gotten out! thanks."
"Yeah, exhaled from my nose a lil. Thanks bro"
"If there’s a silver lining, I guess you can’t lose in any outcome given the circumstances. I hope your pain subsides no matter what happens. Stay strong and good luck"
There's no right way or wrong way to feel about something like this.     I hope your surgery is successful. Please update his. You sound like a great kid.
"To the moon and back, and all days forward, brother mine. No matter what happens. I love you."
Good luck.
You got this man  If you wanna talk now or later hmu
"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.  And yet when you do die they'll say ""he's in a better place"" and ""he's no longer in pain"". They are trying to control your feelings so they don't have to deal with your emotions. They don't understand and they don't want to understand because it sucks and it hurts. They're being selfish.   You're allowed to feel any way you feel. It's natural to want suffering to end. I hate that you're suffering. I hate that you have to be so strong. I hate that you don't have the support you deserve. I hope that your surgery goes well and your life returns a little closer to normal. I hope you're able to find some enjoyment sometimes. I hope you find people in your life who validate your feelings."
"Such a mature attitude for someone your age. You're completely valid in how you feel, and it really isn't anyone else's business.  This being said, I really hope you make it through, your attitude is inspiring, and I'm sure you're a very good person, one that the world needs to experience for longer than 14 years.   Sending you my best, and hoping you're with us tomorrow. 💚"
I feel terrible that I've described my pain to a doctor as an 8-9 for way less and this legend says he's at a 5. Will pray for you.
"Im so sorry, hope you make a recovery"
Ty for the nice word to describe my mottos. I will update.
Please. Keep up updated.
"I don't know you OP, but I'll be thinking of you for the next 5 hours.  I hope that you beat the odds and get to enjoy walking again, but if I don't see an update, just know you'll always be remembered."
"You got this! There is a minority of people who have to grapple with the thought of potential death due to illness such a young age, and your wisdom and maturity surrounding this is very admirable! I’m sorry for the pain you have had to deal with throughout your life, but you have everything to gain with this operation working out and your courage in the face of such trauma is awe inspiring! Very proud of your mentality, strength and courage"
Best of luck !
"God speed man, you have my best wishes."
"i just want to say good luck, and hope the surgeries help for you."
Having you considered talking to a priest?
You got this for sure but I admire your courage.  I feel the same way but it took me 40 years to get there.
Remindme! In 7 days
"Your a better man than most of us kid. It pains me to know that such a wonderful mind is going through some of the worst. there's something you gotta know. The best of us get the worst the world has to give, not because the world hates good people, but because the world wants to see them grow stronger. You are strong. And *when* this surgery suceeds, you'll be so much stronger. Embrace that strength, chase your dreams, let nobody tell you no, and know that you'll be successful. Because your stronger than everyone else around youm There's a whole lot of life to be lived, and I have no doubt that you'll live it to the fullest. And forgive me for calling you kid earlier, your no kid, Your a man."
You're a bad mother fucker dude.
"When you get through, remember to stay positive. Lots of physical health relies on mental health, so try stay happy and entertained after the surgery"
"A lot of medical professionals get stuff wrong every day, don’t need to piggyback on somebody else’s"
"Pain's relative comrade. Some ppl can survive being shot like nothing, and other's cant take a prick from a needle. Everyone's got different pain tolerance lad."
best of luck.
Much love to you! ❤️ Manifesting a long healthy life ahead for you!
"I don’t think it’s morbid, I think you’re just at peace with the fact that you’re having a surgery and there are a few different outcomes. You’re managing your emotions. You’re keeping calm and even before a big surgery. Good for you for handling something stressful so well. You’re well within your rights to scream and cry and be angry and sad, and also to be at peace, too. You get to decide how you stare this down. You seem focused and ready. Fuckin brave as fuck."

I hope we gey another post from you soon (when you've recovered more from the surgery) letting us know you're okay. You're not alone, and you're going to be amazing♥️"

Good luck and God bless you.   I hope you go on to do build things with the type of courage you have.

Hey! Are you still online? Any random thing you’d like to say to me?
"Nobody can tell what u should feel bud, i hope everything goes well for u, greetings from your Brazilian friend ;)"
Hey man you've found a place of peace most people struggle their whole lives to get too.  I sincerely wish you the best in your surgery. Sometimes a strong will and clear mind makes the difference in recovery. Don't give up the fight unless it's what you truly want.   You never know it might make the difference.
"The 'daunting' statistics don't scare me. Like I said, all chances are fine with me. If the 80% works out, then les go! If the 20% happens, welp, time to explore the afterlife. It ought to be a nice adventure."

You are brave. You are strong. You are loved.
I'm sorry. I respect your courage.
"Omg, I cannot imagine the kind of stress and challenges you w had to face in your young life. I feel for you, my own son is of a similar age as you.   I don’t think there’s anything wrong per way with you being at peace with the potential of not making it through, some would refer to it as being apathetic. Maybe you are, maybe you have a point considering the constant discomfort and pain you are in had desensitized you to the reality of the situation.   It’s probably hurtful to those around you that care and love you, because they hold so much hope for recovery and quality of life for you. They may not understand your perspective because they can’t experience exactly what you have continued to for years it sounds like.   I want to wish you the best to you in your surgery. I certainly will remain hopeful for a successful surgery, and successful recovery.   I hope you will be able to update in a few days or so once you’ve recovered a bit. I hope you will can muster a little hope for a successful outcome prior to your surgery as well. Hold your family and friends close to you right now. They sound like they really love you very much. Best wishes and luck to you."
My absolute best wishes for you friend. I hope this is the beginning of better times for you.
"As to the comment about your friends not thinking it's ok with you ""being ok with dying."" 1. They don't quite understand what death is and certainly aren't as ""close"" to it as you feel you are. So it's hard for them to comprehend it. Whereas you have had to face it, so your opinion is a bit more mature. 2. It's perfectly ok to feel that way. Although you DON'T want to die, and no one else wants you to either! But approaching it with a sense of peace about it will make things a lot easier. 3. It's ok if your thoughts about death change back and forth, even within the same hour! You are a human full of complicated feelings and death is a huge thing. You're allowed to think and feel multiple things all at once surrounding the idea of death. 4. For what it's worth, I pray that you will have unexplainable peace, I pray that God will be with the surgeons and that their skill is top notch, and I pray that your body will heal the way it should!"

"Your poor kid. I've had several ""bone"" operations, I always have to sign the form that states I might die, get infected, not be successful etc etc. There's a very big difference between what is technically possible and what is probable. It is extremely probable that you will totally recover and be in a much better place than now, that is the most likely outcome. It's possible you might get hit by an asteroid on the way to the hospital but tbh it's not something worth worrying about, neither are the negative outcomes. I have a bone op tomorrow, ping me and we'll compare notes! You're a brave dude, it will serve you well in life 👍"
Be thinking about you be sure to update us
"I hope this surgery is a huge success and when it is over your quality of life improves.   While I do agree with you,  death should not be feared,  I also hope that one day you enjoy life to the point where you will walk on the side of preferring life."
"People far from death, and the experience of death, often do not understand it.  You do what you have to do. Stay strong, we are all pulling for you."
"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.  I reckon this is because most religions/cultures seems to treat death as something taboo, when it's literally part of nature.  Sure, no one wants to die before their time nor should people actively seek their death but...sometimes death is the only way to take away pain, specially when your body is in a dire situation. EVERYONE will die at some point, not talking about death or not accepting it won't make you immortal.People should start being more comfortable with talking about it, rather than let this stay this ""taboo/controversial theme""."
"honestly this is the mindset to have. I think you'll pull through cuz you seem like a resilient dude, but i personally believe there's no reason to put sugar on shit, you are being completely realistic 🤷‍♂️   that's how i feel about death, lol, if it happens it happens the FUCK am i gonna do about it? why stress, it's not like you're gonna feel sad lol, won't feel anything! i just concur with your outlook.   u got this tho g i hope you are able to find some comfort at least."

That sounds awful to have but sending good luck to the surgery! I hope it goes well. I'm glad it's not causing you to much stress
"Peace is peace, I hope you find it, either way."
"You got this boss. No worries, you’ll come out of this like new."
Rock on dude. No one can tell you how to feel about your situation.   I hope the surgery goes well and that it removes or at least alleviates the constant pain. Check back in with us after the surgery when you're able to.
You've been going through this all your life. You are going to survive this ad kick those tumors asses!
You get all my respect. I hope the surgery goes well.
"Just sending you some love before your surgery. I think your attitude is beautiful, and I'm rooting for you!"
"Godspeed my friend, 20% chance of death means an 80% chance to live :)"
"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.  That's bullshit. Not being afraid of death isn't the same as being suicidal or whatever they think. It's quite brave of you to have accepted that whatever happens, you'll be okay with the outcome. All the same, I wish you great luck with the procedure and hope you're doing better in five hours."
Time to do something shortsighted and crazy.
"There's absolutely a reason those ""they had a sub 1% chance"" survival situation happen, and it's very rarely luck. You'll notice it's effectively never someone obese and with no comorbidities.   Comorbidities are their own entire confounding factor too. You get something that's often caused by or presenting with other things and you don't have those things? Then the overall percent is basically meaningless to you. Like if you have a hormonal issue that gives you something often found in obese patients with serious diabetes then you're facing an entirely different battle.   A 14 year old kid is damn near the perfect surgical candidate. Developed enough that overall size and structure won't change much more, but not done growing yet and thus much better at healing. If anyone has better odds it'd be him."
"you’re 14, aw. praying for you."
Goodluck! Rooting for you!
I don't know if you believe in a god or not but I'm praying for you
"Ty for the well wishes. I understand that they don't understand. It's a pretty difficult situation to sympathise with. But hey, whatever happens, I'll be satisfied so it's fine."

Fingers crossed. I'll pour out a drink for you if you don't reply. Best of luck.

That's a tough situation you're in :c  A 20% chance of dying still leaves you with an 80% chance of surviving and getting better!  I hope everything goes well and you make a full recovery after. Best of luck.

I think you are awesome and brave. Good luck with the surgery. I hope you recover and are pain free.
I will think about you.. and I hope to get an update. You got this! 💕
"I hope everything goes well and the surgery accomplishes getting you some relief. I hope you don’t die, but if you do I hope your peace with it comes from the fact that you will never be in pain or suffer or grieve ever again. Good luck!!"
I think coming to terms with your own mortality is a really mature thing and not everyone ever gets there. I hope you pull through and recover better than you were.
you are very wise. best of luck to you on your journey. i wish healing to you in this world and also the next.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you I send prayers for you. We only get one life so fight for it

"Not just for OP, but...  If you knew you were going to die  Who would you call?  What would you say?   What are you waiting for?"
"I don’t think there’s anything really wrong with not being afraid of death when you’ve had to get used to as much as you have, especially at such a young age. I can’t imagine how rough this has been for you, but I want to tell you a couple stories, to tell you not to lose all hope.   The doctors said my grandma wouldn’t walk again after cancer attacked her for a second time, and it stopped her leg working, and at 81 years old, while she does need a frame, she pulled through to walk again. There was about a 35% chance the procedure she needed to get her heart working would kill her. She got through on the 65%. She’s gone through 2 cancers, COPD, shingles... and she’s always pulled through, between the ages of 65-81.  A good friend of mine was in a severe car accident, and due to shock she ended up exiting her car, and got hit by a second, going at 70mph. The doctors told her family that she wouldn’t make it through the night, and if by miracle she did, she’d only have about a week on a 0.5% chance of survival. Today, she’s living happily with her family again, living her best life. She still has to be careful because she suffered an incredibly large amount of brain damage, but she pulled through a 0.5% chance.    Youre 14, the best thing about a young body is that it heals incredibly quickly. Odds aren’t final, percentages aren’t always right, and you’ve got a chance at a good life ahead. It will never be incredible but it could be a lot better. Doctors aren’t always right. Do what my mum always taught me, hope for the best but prepare for the worst. It’s not let us down so far! Best of luck to you man, I can’t wait to see you pull through."
"Prayers for you brother, you'll be fine inshallah"
I understand more than most. I’ve had a life threatening disease for 25 years. I prepare for the worst and if good things happen it’s a happy surprise. Copium comes in many flavors.  Good luck to you. However you get through life -as long as you’re not hurting people-is your business.

I have prayed that God will guide the surgeons hands, cause the surgery to be successful, and strengthen your heart and body. I have also asked God that He will be pleased to heal you completely of this disease. I wish you and hope for you many good years ahead, disease free or not."

I think you're brave for accepting that it might be your time and you're going out with peace in your heart.   Do you like Lord of the Rings? One of my favorite stories, and in it is my absolute favorite scenes from Return of the King, where Gandalf and Pippin are in Gondor and they're sitting there watching the army of Mordor walk across the plains, and Pippin is scared, but Gandalf talks to Pippin and calms him down, describing the rolling green hills and silver mist.  If you've never read or seen any of Lord of the Rings, I encourage you to explore the lore its one of the many things I think about so I'm not so anxious for a big thing coming up. Like surgery lol  Anyway, sorry for the long post, whats your favorite video game?"

"Doctor here. You misunderstood the risks my dude. You’ll be fine.  Seriously how is nobody questioning these ridiculous odds ? 20% mortality is way more than a heart transplant for example.   Guys, a bit of common sense. Do you actually believe that 1 out of 5 children DIE while having bits of bone removed from their knees or ribs ?   Surely not 1/1000. Probably not a single one in the past few decades in the US."

My thoughts are with you buddy. All the very best. Can’t wait for you to update us letting us know it was a massive success
Sounds like you have accepted death something that everyone of us will eventualy have to do.  Remember you have no choice to die just as you had no choice to be born
My younger brother who is 26 had emergency surgery last year for Crohns that had flared and become infected. Doctors gave him 50 percent of surviving the surgery mainly because his body had become so weak from the infection that they thought the body wouldn’t handle the surgery. His body hadn’t been taking many nutrients for quite some time due to the bad shape of the intestines. They removed seven inches total from the large and small intestine. It was a very rough time for the whole family. He is married with multiple children so it was very hard on his wife also. Doctors are good these days and we just have to trust them and pray for miracles. I hope everything goes well and you get some relief from the pain!
I HOPE YOU THE BEST I BELIEVE YOU ND DOCTORS CN DO IT. GO BRO YOU ARE GOING TO HSVE  WONDERFUL LIFE
"Sending you all the love, good vibes and prayers (if you believe).  You’re stronger than most adults and you’re a damn good fighter.  I hope I see this later on today or tomorrow with an update because I’ll be thinking about you!  We’re all rooting for you!"
"At least you can tell girls that you're the real life wolverine.    If I could replace my spine with a non-ferrous, non-conductive, non-corrosive metal I would.      I've been through 5-7 risky surgeries in my life, and few ""low risk"" ones, so I've grown numb to it.    Here's a few things I've learned for recovery.   Don't eat bread the entire weak before. No pizza nor pasta. Eat it the day after.    Go to the bathroom as soon as possible, get that catheter out the second they let you move out of the bed. This decreases UTI chances.    \*HARD MODE\* Talk to the surgeon and anesthesiologist  tell them you want NO opiate based pain killers. You will use Advil and only Advil to reduce swelling.    I did this, and was able to recover in a weekend, versus my usual weak long stay. Opiates slow the body, slow the constitution, and slows your bodies recovery time.    \^Really consider this carefully though, the first time coming out of surgery is very painful. I was used to it after a few and knew I could handle it.    \*Easy Mode\* Eat stuff that lets you poop easier. You DO NOT want to strain ANYTHING on your body after being cut open. Learn how to ""relax"" your whole body.   Also, protip, if out of the hospital a week or two feeling fine- DO NOT throw a medicine ball around. You may accidently tear something and have to go back.  That's a lesson I learned the hard way. Be willful and strong of mind and body to get out of hospital quickly. Take it easy, relax, enjoy small things in life as you slowly recover outside and in comfort.    Highly ***HIGHLY*** recommend professional Physical Therapy, make your insurance cover it.    I would not be able to walk today if I hadn't done years of PT.      And as always, I'm not a doctor, we don't have the same conditions, so take these with a grain of salt, I'm just sharing my many risky surgeries insights.    Any questions, feel free to ask!"
Thank you
"All my hope goes to you, man! You got this! YOU ARE A WARRIOR! *I really hope I see an update with good news, man* !"
All the love and hope in the world!
"You are in my prayers, young man. God Bless You."
You are a warrior.  I hope the doctors can help you.
"You're an inspiration bro. You deserve a long, painless life and I hope this is the first step in helping you achieve that."
Amen to that!
What kinda music do you like?  Maybe we can help you find some bangers you've never heard before your surgery?   Then you can make a list of concerts you want to go to when you recover!
You got this buddy . I’ll pray for you .
"May the transition be easy, may the other be warm, and may you leave a storm behind when you go.   I do hope this surgery is a success and helps you but thought comforting words for all possibly could be reassuring as well. ❤️"

"Hope you make it dude, but I get where you're coming from. Good luck, whatever happens!"
"Your friend is wrong. Accepting the possibility of dying is a natural thing for those with a very significant risk of doing so. I went through the process myself when I was 27 and had cancer. It is many years ago, and the calmness about my death has stayed with me."
You're a brave man CaptAndrew I will add you to the list of people I aspire to be a courageous as.  I wish you the best legend.

"I had the same type of thing where I was given a certain percent chance of dying. I felt defeated and didn't really care if I died. Until my sister yelled at me and said ""you better fucking fight"" and hearing her tell me that made me determined to live. So I wanna say to you, make sure you fucking fight and we await hearing how well you are doing soon!"
"You are 14 and seem to mentally so much more mature about death than everyone i know from kids to grannies.  I am 33yo male and you have my highest respect!

"I have faith you’ll be fine.   I don’t think there’s anything wrong with how you feel. Your friends can’t accept hearing you say you are fine with dying because they fear losing you, but you are not them. You will not be the one mourning.  If I had a friend say they were fine with dying at 14 I would have said the same things. I might still say the same things if a friend said they were fine with dying, because i would want to hold on to them.  But after years of pain and difficulties myself, I understand where you are coming from. I don’t want to die, I want to live. But life is hard and I have accepted that more realistically than friends of mine who have never experienced the kind of problems that I have.  I recently told a friend of mine that I could very realistically have a certain fatal illness due to preexisting conditions and the symptoms I had at the time.  She just couldn’t cope with it. She denied and deflected and changed the conversation. But I didn’t say it to scare her. Because I’m not scared. To me it’s practical. I want to live. But I’m not afraid of what is to come.   I look forward to your edit, my friend. I hope you feel better. And btw, I would not be sad to have metal ribs. That’s some awesome cyborg shit! Good luck and feel better!"
"Yes, this. There’s no way this procedure, as described, confers a 20% chance of death."
"It breaks my heart as a parent to hear your story which is definitely a tough situation. My oldest daughter at age 3 had a rare cancer.... Many risky treatments and surgeries and it's extremely lucky to live.  Spent years in Boston &amp; NYC hospitals / Ronald McDonald houses seeing some of the worst cases.     Keep up your spirits up (seems as though you are), and you must be tough as shit to even endure what you have already have. Help your family and friends cope who might not be as resilient as yourself.  I hope you comfort and as many happy days with your loved ones."
I wish you all of the luck in the world. You sound strong.  You got this! This makes me sad. I hate that you've had to go through so much as a child. Please update us when you're up to it. Sending you  love and hugs from Delaware

You got this bro!
"U know, theyway they say that 20% chance of death, Its quite hard to wrap your head around it but I like to look at it like  this, there is 20% chance of rain. Or almost like, chances of being killed by a cat are low but never zero.  You look up in the sky and see that 20% chance of rain , and only because there’s a cloud in the sky that obviously won’t make rain, but it is still possible because they are clouds. Like you could be the only one on the road and nobody else and chances from crashing are low but never zero. I hope this helps in a strange way. I’ve seen people I care about get so many surgeries for cancer and each time there was  obviously some percent chance of death. Not exactly comforting , but this has helped me through alot. And even more strange. I think you will be fine. I see you making it through and coming back on here to tell us. … I’ll be waiting."
"You've got this pal. In ireland we light candles and say a prayer for luck, yours is here burning on the mantle!"
20% is extremely high and there’s no way this procedure has a 20% risk of death.
I have something similiar it is Malfucci sydrome and I started having surgery 4 years ago for tumors I most recently had one on my shoulder blade that I was most scared for but I made it through and I am recovering. I hope your surgery goes well and hope you can get some kind of relief!
"I wish you all the best and luck, and if the operation won't work...i hope you can sing w Michael Jackson:)). But i really hope you can walk without any pain and you will enjoy this life🥺"
"Good luck, friend. I hope for the best."
"Best of luck, keep your head up amd try to have a positive attitude (I know easier said then done, especially when in pain)."

Hopefully you'll be posting here again.
You’re in my thoughts. Wishing you all the best. Be strong!
"I'm a burn survivor of 45% of my body and no stranger to pain...  I just had a conversation with my father recently where I expressed that I really don't think people appreciate not being in pain. As when you are in pain, it's the only... The *only* thing you can think about. Just wondering when the pain will end.  I really sympathize with you, and I'm so sorry you've been delt this card.  I'm not sure if you're religious, but good luck and God bless."
Praying for your health and recovery. Stay strong 💕
"Wishing all the best and very speedy recovery   Sending positive vibes, my friend ❤️"
Truly your courage is extraordinary... If I was in your place I'd be wanting to die and alleviate the pain...   You will make a fine gentleman when you grow up.
Good luck pal
"Best of luck! This random internet stranger and their family are rooting for you!  It's understandable that your friends don't understand, and in their eyes they don't want to think of today as the day their friend passes.   I think you have the right attitude. Plus it's better to try and fail then never try at all.  You're dealing with things that most adults have never had to worry about. It's forced you to grow up far sooner than you should.  Stay strong! Hope to get an update from you after the surgery :)"
"If it's fake, you've successfully exposed a lie on the internet. A completely pointless achievement.  If it is real and OP in fact has a chance of dying, you've shown yourself to be a complete piece of shit.  Is it worth it?  Edit: isn't -&gt; is"
Good luck my dude.
"Yeah probably. Still, I'm ready for anything that could happen. No fear lads, I either live and live an honourable life of walking, or die in glorious battle (surgery)"

There is a difference between suicidal and accepting your risks. You're accepting the risks associated with a procedure with a high chance of granting you increased quality of life. Good luck. You're hopefully in good hands.

"Nothing wrong with not being scared of death. That’s good and normal. Death is just not existing.   It’s dying that we’re scared of, because we don’t know when it will happen or how, if it will be painful and whether we will have cleared our browser history."
Ty ❤
"People don't understand that being death-positive and being suicidal are two very different things. If you feel so inclined, have a look at the Ask A Mortician YouTube channel. Caitlin Doughty has a lot of very good insights and also there are a bunch of history videos that she's done if that's your speed.   You could also check out the Crash Course YouTube channel, specifically the playlist on Philosophy. They have an extremely good episode that philosophically discusses death; I believe it's episode 17 but I'm not positive.   I'm sorry I don't know how to post links on mobile, but you should be able to find them with no trouble"
"I don't know you from anybody else, and I'm just a random stranger on the internet, but I commend you for your courage and for dealing with things in a realistic way. I hope the operation is a success and that you have a long, happy, and healthy life. I hope to raise my kids to be as brave as you."

"Hi op, my parents are doctors and my father is a cardiac surgeon who operates people nearly in a daily basis. He tells me that nearly in all operations where the patient is fully sedated the probability of death is 20% due to cases of  misuse of anaesthetics, even though the operation is simple. In your case I don't think the operation is a life or death situation (it is a complicated one so I am not sure tho :\^/) ones like my father is used to so I think you  should simply not think about possibility of death. Just relax and spend the few hours before the operation doing what you do normally. But just in case my ideas about death is similar to yourself. If it happens it happens. So keep doing what you are doing and don't think  about the bad outcomes. Be hopeful and think about the future where you are moving as freely as you can. I wish you the best of luck and a long, happy and healthy life.  Ps: I think you being 14 should decrease the odds of death to like 5 to 10 percent imo so really unlikely :)."

"Why do you nurses always do this? Please stop.    In the common vernacular it might not be considered a tumor as such, but it IS a tumor because the base definition is slightly broader than you realize.   Once something causes tissue to swell outside of a correct area, that damaged swollen tissue is ALSO called a tumor.    From his exact description it sounds like he had brain tissue swell and tumor outside of his skull.    That is a technical and accurate way to describe that.    Trust me when I say, I've had over 18 years of hospital and medical experience, and for some reason, if *some* nurses haven't previously heard of something, they can't possibly fathom it not existing or them not knowing about it, automatically calling other people wrong. What is that? I think it's an ego thing, but relax, and trust someone's word who went through it."
"I imagine living in constant pain makes the fear of death less obtrusive, but there's plenty of cool stuff to see and experience, don't forget to fight. plus you're going to be a cyborg which is pretty cool.

"As someone who had sciatica (pinched nerve from degenerated/ herniated discs in my spine) I can't imagine how painful it would be to have  this occurring all throughout my body.  It takes a lot for a person to explore their feelings and thoughts when they are in regards to a difficult topic, and especially one that is out of our control. I applaud your courage to share your struggles on here.  You are really strong to face such challenges at such a young age.  Best wishes for a successful operation and a quick recovery."
Hope you have one hellovah come up story from today.
Sending you good vibes from Washington!  I hope you wake up from a successful surgery and your awesome attitude just bolsters what I suspect will be a great life full of gratitude and grit that few people can rival.
"It's not wrong, it's called resignation, and imo it's a good thing because that means that you could die peacefully which is the best thing than can happen to a human in such a scenario. From the bottom of my heart, best of luck!"
!remindme 1 week  Good luck! I hope all goes well.
Best wishes to you and have faith. Hope for a better future keeps us all alive. (gentle) hugs to you.
"Good luck, and you are going in with a realistic attitude given your options. Your condition sounds awful and I would opt for surgery to try to walk too. Make sure your wishes are known if things don’t go well.  Now to everyone else, see there is someone having a worse day than you so whatever crap you’re dealing with flush it and be glad you don’t have to make the options OP has had to."
You've got this homie.
Like on other person said your chances of survival is alot more than 80% but even if it is 20% 15% or 10% that's still 80% 85% and 90% Chance so the dice is weighted towards the good outcome
"Good luck, I hope we get an update from you in a week."

Good luck honey.  I’m sending positive thoughts and good vibes your way.  You can do this.  I hope it works!
Godspeed my dude
Your feelings are incredibly valid. People who’ve never been through real pain don’t understand the desperation and toll it takes; don’t let your friends tell you how to feel.
"and that's all that matters - how you feel about everything. When we spent time w/my BFF, it was literally his last week alive. Took him out to watch Endgame and he spent time with my family. His wife called me the day he passed. She told me, he was happy and that he was okay if has to go. And he let go. When you're at peace with that, your body is finally at peace. And I personally think that's what matters the most for yourself.  Sending you love from afar...."
"You better fucking live man , thousands are cheering for you , fight till the end and don't lose hope"
"It absolutely is not wrong to accept the possibility of death. We are all mortal creatures and were all going to die eventually. In a case like this where its kind of a gradual thing, id EXPECT the person to at least accept their mortality, if not embrace the fact that it could be over sooner than they expect. I think itd be a lot more peaceful if youre accepting of it than if you tried to fight or deny it.   People are really wierd about death, and it makes them very uncomfortable when they encounter someone who ISNT."

My sister has chari it does not  mean she has a brain tumor the back of her skull never fully formed causing her brain to come out of the skull causing bad migraines yes there was was surgery to fix that and more surgeries on her head as well as on her spine to fix the fluid to to go up and down on it

"Hey man, I know how you feel, having been in a similar situation although not as severe. The amount of anxiety I felt before my surgery was immense. I highly respect you for being able to keep your calm and remain down to earth even in the situation you’re in. I know you can make it and I hope you have a swift recovery."
"I will be waiting for your edited post, OP!"
"I wish more humans had the strength and guts as this kid has!! What a absolute bad ass.  My son is 15 also and has leukemia and is going through chemo. You all are the most amazing humans ever.

Wishing you the best for a safe and speedy recovery. I think your attitude is great. You can’t control the outcome so best not to get upset about it. It will be what it will be but the odd are greater for it to be successful than not and any improvement will be worth it.   Update us when you can 👍🏻
"Good luck, I hope you have a good surgical outcome.  Also don't sweat it, genetics gave you a shitty hand (figuratively, and literally) it's ok to feel how you do."

Yeah 20% is extremely high for your age and condition. It’s probably 1% and that 1% is all on anesthesia not fucking up
Do you have names for your tumors?
Bro you got this. You will kick this tumor in the rear and come back stronger!
"You are a brave motherfucker, and you need a wheelbarrow for your balls. I understand how you have come to terms with your mortality. But i like a warrior going to war and accepting potentially dying does not mean you should not fight to win the battle. You got this bro and i am spiritually there for you!"
You’re a pretty impressive 14 year old. My money is on you recovering fine from your operation and then going on to do great things with your life.
"You're allowed to feel any way you want and its not wrong. Honestly shame on your friends for trying to invalidate your feelings. YOU are the one who is facing this risk and they should be supportive of you no matter what. I imagine most people who choose to undergo a risky surgery feel similarly to you. Obviously you hope for the best, but they give you the odds so anyone who says yes to a risky surgery does so understanding that they're risking their life. You don't opt for the surgery if you don't want to take those odds. Your quality of life has been severely impacted and you made a brave choice to try to fix it. But you're also totally aware of the risks. I honestly feel like this kind of mindset is better for you because you're being realistic and not ignorant or relying on faith alone. You're going at it with acceptance of the reality you face. For what it's worth, I'm hoping for the best for you."
I'm 100% rooting for you to pull through. 14 is full of courage and possibilities. You have your entire life ahead of you little brother. Best wishes.

"Hey. Coming from someone with chronic pain and someone who also beat the odds during surgery (14% chance of survival), you are fully entitled to feel all of this. Your friends who think it's wrong to think this way don't understand what it's like to live in constant pain. It is extremely difficult both physically and mentally to live with and is so exhausting. You are allowed to feel all of the things right now.   I wish you the best outcome, and am sending you as many healing vibes as I can muster. 💜 You can do this."
"Hey so sorry to hear what’s going on dude. You’re so strong, stronger then a lot of people. I’ll pray for you. And hey, one thing I want to suggest is that you pray too? Promise you God is on the other side waiting to hear ya.   You got this man."

"It's VERY much okay to feel okay about dying. In situations like yours, it's healthy. Your friends are just afraid of losing you and they feel like you coming to terms with your mortality is like you giving up, but you are not giving up, you have found peace with your situation. You're already in enough pain, why should you have to feel pain and guilt about the possibility of dying as well?"
Totally understand how you feel.
Roll with the punches.
I'm sorry you are going through this. You're very brave. How you feel about dying is entirely up to you. It's a personal process. I hope your surgery goes well and wish you all the best in life.
"I wish you all the best, you got this. I'll be waiting for updates from you after your surgery :D"

"I truly hope you will be okay, but if you suddenly find yourself before the creator, would you mind telling them we need help here on earth?"
"Before you were born there was nothing. When we die there’s nothing. So that means nothing leads to something and death is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.  That said, you’ve got lots to look forward to and learn and 80% is good odds."

Four plus years ago I was in a terrible bus crash. I probably would have been killed except for my head to toe survival gear. I was also traveling with two extremely specialized bags called vert packs whose combined centrifugal force kept the bus from spinning out into traffic and killing many people. The police report was nine pages long. I refused all of the narcotic prescription painkillers and surgeries after the crash. Today would be a very different day if I had not done that. If I could get through the painful aftermath the way that I did- you can beat your difficult situation. One thing I have learned from all of this? Relax because relaxed people make the best decisions. Also: to Officer Brian Scott Pare- thank you for investigating the case. To the firefighter/EMT's of Boca Raton Fire Services: you have my lifelong gratitude for having saved my life that day. Alternatively: I still think Florida stinks and once I am back home in NYC never setting my eyes on this Godforsaken state again is my future plan. Ms. Katrin Blumenfeld AKA Kat CEO of SSV

"Hey there,  My boyfriend has this disease and he's had bone shaved off multiple times and everywhere you can think of.  Both wrists, ribs, knees, legs, ankles knuckles, , shin, etc  He has nasty wicked scars because of the surgery type and he has been having surgery since he was before 10. I know what your pain looks like. I'm so sorry.  If it's any consolation my boyfriend and his mother both have had the disease and have come out each and every time complication free. It's scary especially because they're taking away your bone but you are in the trusted hands of professionals and you need to trust that they are experienced and if complications do occur there is always a plan in place and a backup plan after the backup plan. You are safe.   I won't lie, it looks painful as fuck. And recovery is slow. I've never seen my boyfriend in as much pain as after they wheeled him out of surgery for his legs. They didn't give him enough pain relief. Make sure you're drugged up to hell and back!"

"From economically a person there's nothing wrong with making peace with the fact that your life may end. In fact, those who are prepared for death typically have a better death when observed from the outside. They typically are more peaceful, more ready to go, and struggle less. Accepting this possibility and being ready to address it isn't a bad thing. It's just a thing that healthy people have never had to consider.   Don't be afraid to report your pain accurately post procedure. And don't feel bad if you acquire more painkillers than you would like. Recovery is non-linear but at your age you should pop back pretty well. You've got all of reddit behind you."

"Another take on being ready to die:  We all die eventually.  No matter what.  Finding acceptance means you don't die miserable and tragically lamenting said death.  It's a very fine line, but there's a difference between suicide ideation and acceptance of mortality.  One can fight like hell to survive, and still die with a smile thinking ""At least I tried my best"" right?"

One of the few remaining federal cannabis patients in America has the same condition.  He successfully treats his MHE with cannabis provided by the federal government.  It may also help you.  It would definitely help with pain management.  It may be worth looking into that form of treatment.
You got this my guy ❤️
Get right with Jesus!
I hope everything goes well. Just here to spread my hopes and good wishes to you
All i can say is good luck. You got this.  Promise to let us know when you wake up?
"Hey bud. Wow, you are so brave. I am in awe of your strength and your calm thoughts on this.   Your friends are probably really having a hard time working through this for themselves. 14 is so young to deal with mortality, especially in yourself. They are scared of losing you, and scared of what it means - that anyone can die at any time. So I don’t blame them for their thoughts on your outlook.   But I just want to tell you that I hope you come out the other side, and that you can enjoy some of the cool things life has to offer. I’m gonna follow this post, maybe you can update when you are able to. Thoughts and well-wishes to you."
"I wish you all the quick and good recovery! I really hope for you it goes well and that you can walk again, much love and hugs"
Hey man — rooting for you. I’ll be checking your posts throughout the upcoming week to make sure that you’re recovering well. Cheers 🤘🏻
Hell man that sucks. Be positive and strong we are with you.
Good luck you got this!!

"This life is fleeting and that causes many people (myself included) great distress. And it can be jarring to people when others have come to terms with their own mortality.  You are brave, courageous, and most importantly humble. You are going to be walking into a life or death surgery and have come to terms with either outcome. This is a huge feat that many people never accomplish.  I hope you get the best outcome and are able to live a long and mobile life. And if not at least you won't go kicking and screaming at the end like others. Good luck friend and may our paths cross again"

I have my one and only tattoo for him and we meet together once a year to remember him. I'd like to think he's out there somewhere influencing us in some way. My favorite memory was all of us over at his house to watch his favorite college football team and me cooking on a grill for everyone.   I guess what I mean is, even if you go you will never be forgotten by those you love, and you will always be remembered in a good way if you've done an ounce of good for someone. I am also okay with dying at any point in my life the way I've lived so I understand. Dm me if you want to talk or play apex or halo."

"Yeah unless it’s your disorder you don’t really get a say. Also you’re just wrong. You’re a nurse not a neurosurgeon or a neurologist. You also need to mind your manners as this 1 isn’t about you and 2 you DO NOT get to question my profession. This isn’t work (physicians assistant) this is Reddit where l find it unnecessary to be a long winded blowhard who goes on and on about technical things concerning MY OWN DISABILITY, especially on someone else’s post. If you were a real nurse you might understand that. But you nurses tend to think you’re above everyone else and generally lack in humility and bedside manners."
Good luck.

"Having undergone many surgeries myself, I find that my mental state going into surgery directly affects my post-op recovery time and outcome.  I can't explain it, but there must be a connection between body and mind that impacts this in some way.    I also tend to be more pragmatic but, I do try to focus on the positive and the best possible outcome.  It helps that my surgeon is very optimistic and that can be contagious...maybe that is done by design.     Good vibes coming your way.  I look forward to your update."
I wish you luck with your operation OP. I know you're not suicidal.. You've just accepted the fact you cannot control whether you live or die And have accepted the fact that death is inevitable for all people  .. That is something grown adults struggle with... I truly hope everything goes in your favor today.. And that we get an update as soon as possible.. I wish you a speedy recovery
Not much to add but wanted to wish you all the best with your surgery. See you on the other side mate.

That's  very important information for everyone looking up statistics. Thank you.

Yeah i dont want to pile on the kid because this is still awful and stressful but 20% no way.. fraction of a % and it would be because something went terribly wrong.  Also maybe i'm wrong but i cannot imagine a doctor in the developed world that would accept to do a procedure on a 14 year old with a 20% chance of death on what is apparently a quality of life procedure.
Be tough. Think positively. Believe in your doctors.  I wish you well.

Praying for you.
You'll be OK. Both of my kids (18 and 14) and their mother have MHE. The kids have been through 2 surgeries each. Their mother has been through more than I want to count.  I truly know it sucks having MHE and having them removed but you'll be fine. Just make sure your parents have done their homework on the orthopedic surgeon. MHE is very uncommon and you want someone who is versed in it.
"Is the reason you’re not afraid of dying during the procedure, because it would be a relief from all the pain?"

"Man everybody has a birth, a life, and a death. If this is your time, that fucking sucks but statistics are on your side for that to not be the case. Think of what you're passionate about.

"I don't know what to tell you bro because I can't relate at all. But, I'm hoping to hear from you in a day or two. You got this my man!"
"We all might die at anytime, technically. You'll be okay. 80% chance of living is basically 100% chance of living rounded up."
"Looking at it from the perspective of stoic philosophy, I think you have the perfect mindset about life, and it doesn’t have anything to do with your condition. You are a paragon of stoicism in your display of resilience and acceptance. Acceptance of one’s condition and eventual death shouldn’t be feared or dreaded. I hope that if ever I should suffer an illness like yours, I take it with as much alacrity and indifference as you seem to show. Thanks for the good read, I have a lot of respect for you and wish you the best of luck in your procedure."

"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.   your friends don't get a say in this, they can fuck *right* off. they're not the ones living with tumors that cause you immense pain.   &gt;I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point.   while i don't condemn you in any way for your feelings on the matter. i disagree. this is passive suicidal ideation. it's when you have thoughts about death/desire for death/not caring if you die when there's a chance you could, and don't actively make/carry out plans to die.    if you come out of your surgery i encourage you to think about this and seek help if you feel you need it.   -wishing you a safe journey."

"How you feel is not wrong. There's a massive difference between the acceptance of death and being suicidal. Everyone should accept death.

This makes them uncomfortable (which, btw, isn't their fault)."

"Wow, this is so inspirational. I wish you all the best of luck, we're all praying for you. Hope the surgery goes well!"
"I have a more minor case MHE so its really only spurs on my appendages, not my back or ribs. Had more than my fair share of surgerys but am very grateful its not any worse. Spending lots of time in a Shriners and seeing the shit other kids had to deal with really sets how good I really had it"
I see the bullshit r/teenagers type posts have made their way here...
"No offense, but I hope for you a great remaining life…and if you do succumb, I wish you a great death.  I am sorry that you are going through this at such a young age. It’s not fair, it’s not right…but it is what it is. I am sure that you already understand this and are dealing with that terrible fact the best that you can.  Anyway… rest assured that I empathize with you."
"I'm one of the few who understand your perspective. I've lived with a form of cancer for 9 years, a type that is incurable. I used to be in a lot of pain and lived (if you can call it living) in bed day after day. 3 times I was in hospital and almost succumbed, but fate, fortune or some guardian angel kept me alive. I'm much better now even though I'm closely monitored by doctors, but those early years leave scars that can't be seen.  I developed an outlook much like yours, it means nothing to me to die at this point, I've had my full share of pain. It's difficult to talk about with family because I know they'll want me to live if it came down to it.   This outlook is not one of wanting or even wishing for death, I am most definitely not suicidal, it just doesn't matter much to me at this point to check out. That being said, I met someone wonderful and our wedding is set for later this year. I have plenty to live for and I know that my death would be devastating to my fiance but I can't change how I feel about my own end if it comes, the scars will always be there.   Despite my own proclivities, I wish you the best and hope you make it off the operating table in good health. Best of luck to you today and going forward beyond."
OP you got this.  Fuck those tumors.  It'll take more than two ribs and a knee to take you out.  I wish you relief from your pain.  Good luck man.
Omg son. Don’t give up. I am living proof that if you fight hard enough you can beat the odds.    My thoughts are with you    Gods speed
You are looking at this from a very utilitarian standpoint.  The risk of dying is worth it given the potential upside in quality of life.

"I got hurt in a skydiving accident.  Destroyed my left knee.  Very active person so this has been hard for me, getting my third and hopefully last surgery in a few weeks.  This post certainly puts my predicament into perspective.   I want you to know there's nothing wrong with feeling ok about dying.  You understand something about life that your friends have no concept of because you have truly faced the concept of death in your head and come to peace with it.  Most of us have not. In my estimation, this means that while you understand and accept death, you can also understand and accept what life means on a different level.    Im sorry you have to go through this brother, but I am impressed by how you are confronting the challenge given to you. Many people much older than you do not have the capability to confront such a thing with the attitude you are.  I will be thinking of you tonight and while I'm not religious I will do my version of praying for your survival, full recovery and ability to walk, write and enjoy your life more than you could prior to this surgery.  Thank you for sharing it is a reminder to all of us that life is a gift that only lasts so long so make what you can of it while you have it.  Best of luck my friend, I hope to see a follow up tomorrow.  It's hard to even find words to express the feelings reading your post gives me and how I wish for your recovery but I hope you feel at least some of it through my words and know there are people all over the world rooting for you today❤️"
"Stay strong kid, you’re a trooper. I’m rooting for you ❤️"
Prayers are sent out to you.. let us know when you come back on reddit.
I 34M have 9/10 nerve pain from head to toe. I recommend cymbalta or amatriptaljne if you aren’t on some sort of medication. It takes the nerve pain down to a 1/10. Granted we don’t have the same exact issue it seems like it would help. It’s taken 4 years of trying different meds to find one that will work and that I can deal with the side effect.
Good luck. Hope to see your update post soon.
"I wish you nothing but the best outcome.   I pray that you can beat this. I accept that you accept that you can die and that makes.me.sad as you are so young. WHEN you come.out of surgery, please update us."
"I think if they are ""sometimes"" called a ""fluffle"", unless ""they're fighting in which case it's a 'kerfluffle'"", that actually leaves the door wide open for the ""rest"" of ""sometimes"" to be a ""colony"".   Or I smoked too much weed a bit ago, not sure. In my defense, it's my day off."
"Just wanted to say, I’ve got HME too and know the anxiety around these surgeries. I went through 24 surgeries before I was 22. It gets better once they are gone and you stop growing. It’ll never be perfect and stormy weather will always be terrible. Biggest advice is to take it easy and really focus on your physical therapy, it’ll prevent further range of motion issues later down the line. At 14 you’re pretty young and heal pretty quick since you’re growing and all. Feel free to send a PM if you have any questions or just need to talk to someone who’s been in your shoes. I’ll be thinking about you in the coming hours and wish you a speedy recovery."
Everyone finds their peace at different times. I'm sure you'll eventually find peace sometime later in your life. But who am I to give advice? I'm just a 14yo lol.  Thank you for the well wishes. Let's see if I live through this.
You got this big man! Kick this disease in its dick once you're walking again!
"Hey man that’s rough I hope this operation goes well and I’m sure it will, they are professionals after all. Good luck"

Hey my good friend. Life is so unfair and I’m sorry you are dealing with this. You are SO STRONG and I know it can be tiring but your purpose in life could be helping others and thank you for posting. My heart and prayers go to you and you got this. Power of manifestation is strong so please believe in it. I hope you come out healed and able to go through life easier😘😘😘 keep staying strong.

"Wow, I’m in awe of your courage.  You got this.  🙌✊"
Good luck out there kiddo
"We all might die in 7 hours. I hope your 7 are better than mine, sounds like you will appreciate it more than me though."
"Physician hier. You definitely have odds way better than 20%! Keep your head up, you gonna get through in no time!"
"Ty, nice to meet someone in the same boat."
I'm sorry that your condition has got that bad. People who don't deal with chronic pain can't understand your viewpoint. I hope the surgery helps you and brings you some comfort.
"Good luck, whatever that means for you."
"FYI tumor: “a swelling of a part of the body, generally without inflammation, caused by an abnormal growth of tissue, whether benign or malignant”.   That’s pretty much textbook chiari. Which is why my neurosurgeon explained it that way."
I hope you heal + have the best life ever.
"I hope whatever the outcome is, you find what you're looking for. You can do this, I believe in you."
"I hope to hear about your update, OP!"
I expect you to give us an update soon since my gut feeling tells me you are a fighter and not a whiner. You got this my friend ☝️. I'm with you....
Only. When. They’re FIGHTING!
"Good luck, bud."
"Good luck, friend.  It's not wrong to feel that way.  Wishing you the best."
"You do what you want, and don't worry what others say. You see an opportunity to make your life better, and you are gonna go for it! Nothing wrong with that. At least you are living life how you want, which is more than others can say. Good luck on the surgery."
Sending you hugs and prayers my friend. You will do great. I know it. Please keep us updated.
You got this!
"See you when you wake up and have to reply to all the coments from this post bud go in to tha surgery like a champ, will meet you at the end of the dreamland called anesthesia."

You’re only 14 years old yet you have the insight of a grown man! You have an amazing gift and I’m 100% sure you still have so much more to do here on Earth. You will get through this! ❤️
I know you'll likely not see this buried in the comments but with everything else going on in the world this is your own personal battle and almost nobody will know what it's like to deal with this at your age. I'm 36 and I take a lot for granted but reading your post helps me understand the futility of a lot of things besides the beauty to live. I believe in you.   I'm looking forward to seeing your next post.
You are in exactly the right frame of mind.   This will help your family cope if the dice doesn’t come up in your favor. They will know you were prepared for the worst but still fighting for the best.   I wish you luck and we look forward to you posting your full recovery and walking again.

"Accepting death is a lot different than seeking death. We should all strive to accept death during our lives, but I'm sorry you've had to face this already.  You're friends don't understand because it'd be nearly impossible for someone at that to age understand it, unless they're going through it like you are."
Fortune favors the bold. Good luck!
You got this. I was hoping this was longer than 7 hours ago and you were already commenting.
Hope you live good luck man
"It's not wrong to feel okay, death is a part of life and there is always a point where you need to accept death. My grandfather currently has cancer and I know he'll be gone in around 6 months, best estimates with treatment are under a year. I've come to terms with it and I know he's lived a long life (he's 87 now) and he's also comfortable with it. I've had to deal with a lot of people dying in my life (parents weren't young when they had kids, lots of older friends and relatives) and there's nothing you can really do.  Crying and feeling sad doesn't cure leukemia.  You're young and healthy, there's a much better chance of you surviving than others with the same condition, you're very brave, good luck with your surgery"
I admire your courage . Thank you for sharing your experience because I have learned from you. I do hope the roll of the dice leaves you without the pain and alive.  Thinking of you.
"May your d5 roll come up nat 20 forever, brother."
"Death is not a bad thing. I don't understand why your friends would think it is not ok to feel this way.   Death is another part of life and you only get to experience it once. I hope you go into this experience as fully as possible to get the most out of it, whenever that happens!"
So your first idea is to go to Reddit? We’re internet people were not very good at giving advice

"Your life is yours. No one can tell you how to feel. I lost both of my parents to disease when I was young. Death is undeniably and inescapably part of life. I admire your perspective tremendously. It's weird to say this, I'm 32 and you're 14, but you remind me so much of my father--he was a good man, kind and gentle, and I learned so much from watching him go through something not too different from what you're going through. For what it's worth, how he behaved in that time shaped me for the rest of my life. You have more power now than maybe you can even know. God speed friend."
praying for you my friend
"There is nothing wrong with coming to terms with the possibility of death. Fear and pain are what really cause suffering. Pain can be subdivided into basically everything you can think of.  Coming to terms with death means you dont have fear to cause you suffering. It cant hurt your psychy, it cant hurt others, and there is less stress on your body.  Someone telling you ""you should be afraid"" is someone who hasnt experienced much suffering. Objectively, no one should want to die. But there isnt anything wrong with knowing it could happen and being ready for it."
Open heart and honest mind. If it comes to the end- remember to say Jesus after you see your own body. I am not thumping here. I am telling you from a lot of NDE(near death experiences) that it isnt a joke. Hope you know you are Loved and that you wake up without anything but a smile.
Good luck OP I wish you all the best. I'll be looking out for your post update ♥️
Just sounds like you're at peace with it. It's out of your hands now.
Please update us as soon as you can after surgery
Stay strong OP. You are very brave to go through this procedure. I am rooting for you!!
Too much weed this time mate
"Your friends are trying to reassure themselves. They are not prepared to face that fear, and seeing you ready makes them all the more cognizant of that possibility. So don't listen to them too much, but know that it's their very flawed way to tell you they love you so, so, so very much.  Anyway, since you've expressively allowed us to comment anything, here's an anecdote: back when we had a cat, he had fully integrated the human way of life. He had learned to open closed doors for instance. But most amazingly, from time to time, he would just decide to go full human and use the toilet. Yes. He would open the door, sit on the throne, do his business and just leave us the surprise there.  It was only occasionally though. Maybe he felt like he needed to be like us for once and then heed nature's call again.  Good luck on your surgery.  Edit : RemindMe! 3 days ""check for updates"""
Good luck homie! I'll be praying for you
Looking forward to hear back from you
"OP, you are braver and stronger than this 35 year old mom who has had two C-sections and a hip operation. You are young and despite the odds, they are in your favor for that reason by itself. Please, keep us updated, and good luck."

You would be surprised how much your body can go thru you will be fine. But maybe have a nice night before the surgery. If possible rent a stripper too haha
"Best of luck to you, you’ve got thousands of people on your side. Hope to see you posting in four hours.  EDIT: Wheyyyy!"
Stay strong.
Praying hard for you. During a c section I had major communications and flat lined twice and other stacks of issues. Doctors said I’d never make it back up to the OR. I prepared my self to die for almost 2 hours and wasn’t scared because I knew where I was heading.   I admire you’re strength and courage. Currently praying hard for you now and remember doctors have no say so in your chances of living. Please please keep us updated
Much love and hugs💗
Good luck bud. Hopefully you'll be walking around in no time
I wish I could be 10% as brave as you are. Praying for you and your update in 7+X hours.
Please post an update!
We look forward to hearing from you next week.
The maturity you are showing at age 14 is absolutely amazing. You are wise beyond your years to be facing any and all possible outcome. Your friends on the other hand are afraid to experience or think about loss. Wishing you all the best and thank you for putting my minor problems in perspective.
I’ll pray for you.
Yo if you survive that's gonna be the most badass shit I've ever heard of.   No one can tell you how to feel.

I’m sorry you’re going through this and I truly hope you get through this and have less pain.
"Your friends are young and scared.  They don’t mean to upset you I believe.  You understand a part of life they do not yet, and it is ok. You’re brave. I wish you the best friend."

"!remindme 10 hours  Once you get out of surgery, tell us about it, alright? Rooting for you!"
"Well on the bright side, if you win, then your gonna have a awesome story to tell other people. Besides 80% is a great deal"
Wishing you the best! May fate's and the doctor's hands be good to you today!
My comment to you is you are braver than me cause I'd be afraid. I wish you well and you're in my prayers.   My  comment anything is my idea of a pet is a rock. I'm not an animal person.
Rooting for you💚
Praying for you bud.
"That's a rough life you've fought through, you are clearly stronger than you think!  Also, in a condition like yours, it's perfectly normal to feel that it's ""ok"" to move on from this plane of existence if that's what's gonna happen.   Personally, i think you will make it through this, and that you will be better, and i wish you the best of luck with your surgery and recovery! Keep us posted, will you?   As a sidenote.. Have you talked to family and friends about you being ok with all outcomes? If it should go wrong, it might be a comfort for you to know they know you're at peace. It might sound silly, but for someone being the one remaining when someone close left this world, one of my biggest comforts was (and is) a voice message i can listen to when i miss them as most. Just food for thought."
Keep your head up kid
I'm glad my post helped you in some way. And thank you for all the compliments and well wishes. Appreciate it.
Surgery is scary. It's OK to be scared and to cry. I had a few over the years. A few of them were over 3 hours. And one was 14 hours.
"I suffer from extreme chronic pain that surgery can't fix, so I sympathize. But you're too young to lose hope! When you wake up, remember, you aren't alone. Look at how many people you've touched."
Good luck my friend. You got this! ❤️
If it means anything.. i am sorry life threw this at you. If you live.  You should get yourself the biggest bucket of your favourite icecream and eat that. Stay safe.  It's hopefully gonna get a tiny bit better. Let's hope miracles still exist..
You are so brave. Good 😊 luck 🍀
I will be praying for you.
"Individuals are not statistics.  We are not a normalized distribution of events, we are single points of experience.  A 2% chance of death or a 90% chance of death is the same as a 50% chance of death.  You will either be in one group or the other, and you don't know which you will be in until it happens.  Odds don't matter when you only have one go.  So no, its definitely not wrong to be okay with your odds.  You're just less delusional than most people, partly because the odds are higher than what most people face."
May god look down on those surgeons

"As the great Han Solo once said, Never tell me the odds. We internet strangers are here for you, bud!"
"You're more calm than I would be. I know it's not much, but I'll be thinking about you, friend. I hope the surgery goes well and that it's able to help you ❤️"
"You’re in my prayers, captain…🙏🏻🍀🤞🏻"
I know how you feel. After enduring what you’ve endured. Death just doesn’t seem like a big daunting thing. It just don’t make sense for people but then again they aren’t you or have had to live your life have they?

"Can you link me to a definition of tumor that jives with what you said?

Good luck bro. You’re incredibly mature.

"You ll be fine fam. Had 10 plus surgeries in a year with similar kinda #s different situation butits always just a short nap and a recovery and if its not its not your concern. It comes with understanding your issues and how they effect your life. To live good you have to take the chance. If you loose its not death thats a loss, a loss is being more crippled in the future. Good luck a a speedy recovery"
"When I was about your age I was in a shooting accident.   I was gutshot, lost an organ or two and still carry the bullet inside me to this day.   I was released from the hospital in 4 days.   Being as young as I was vastly improved the odds.   Sending good vibes your way, good luck."
"I think most of us can agree that whatever we were worrying about today, when seeing a post like this, seems extremely trivial and somewhat irrelevant.  Thank you OP for putting things into perspective and I wish you a speedy recovery. You're not going anywhere yet young man! Love and prayers to you."
Well maybe you need to learn more because it’s often referred to as a tumor. Like I said knowing someone who has it isn’t the same as having it and being a nurse isn’t the same as a someone who specializes in neuroscience. There’s always room to learn more and if your child really has this you definitely need to not be so rigid because there’s always more to learn.

Message me if you need to discuss your pre-surgery feelings because, while you may not feel fear, it is still going to fuck around with your emotions. But also think about the other side... when you have recovered from surgery, you will have less pain. Your life will be easier and thats a wonderful thing. Know you have a friend thinking of you through your procedure ❤"

Love you man.
I’ve spent the last 2 years holding the hands of those dying from COVID because their family couldn’t be there. I have a perfectly good bedside manner. Chiari is not a tumor. My child has chiari. Im aloud to say it’s not a tumor. Also most physicians assistants who work in a hospital would never speak badly of a nurse. They know how hard we work and how much we care for our patients because we typically work together. You must work in an office with no nurses if you can say nurses think that way.
"Sending hopeful and understanding thoughts your way. I, too, suffer from chronic pain but nowhere near what you’re dealing with. I’m having surgery on the 29th, though, again, not as risky as yours but I empathize with you and have had all the same thoughts and feelings. You’re quite brave and strong to be dealing with this as well as you are. I hope you have great doctors and get the most positive results possible. Please update us when possible."

I know someone I who had something similar to this with around a 30 to 40% death rate it’s always scary but then just think about the other 60% and just compare them and suddenly you’ll realise how big of a number 60 is or in your case 80 and although being worried is normal there is almost nothing to fear since literal science and some of the most extremely skilled people have your back(also the person survived but again it wasn’t exactly your condition it was something about bones but I can’t remember what since I have lost most contact with this guy but I do know he’s alright now)
Is there something like a remind me bot? I really wanna know the outcome dude

"You might be too young for this - but it seems that smoking/drinking is correlated to success. (based on an n of 1). Tell your doctors! In all seriousness though my son went through a lot of invasive procedures, bone marrow transplant, associated other unpleasantness. Was told by doctors “he’ll never be able to walk or talk, he might be blind”. Just a horror show. But he’s running around, chatting up a storm, sharp video game crushing vision. I appreciate the doctors have to tell you all the risks. But don’t over rotate around that. And it sounds like you’ve achieved the right zen level of acceptance - a maturity beyond your years that will support you well in the many years to come. You’ve got this - and this internet stranger is rooting for you. Hang in there!!"

I live with chronic pain that never goes away and I can’t imagine what you are going through.  It struck me my 5 and your 5 are probably quite different but you’ve adapted.  I expect if I experienced your 5 it would be an 11 for me.   But the thought of being ok if it doesn’t work out and not having to suffer anymore is ok.  I think it’s a very reasonable feeling and anyone with compassion and empathy would understand it.  They may not like it but they should at least accept your view and be there for you no matter what.
Stay Strong 💪🏻

"Good luck! If it's any relief to you - generally speaking, the ""chance of death"" percentages often neglect to include any information about comorbidities. So if you're relatively healthy, your chances of complications are lower. Also - you don't know exactly WHICH comorbidities are risky.  Complicating this is that MHE is rare (1:50000). The data that shows that the 20% that die in surgery could be from a limited sample size.   Surgery always sucks (I've had a dozen, some on my heart, my knee, my eyes, my chest, among others) and I don't wish it on anyone, but I'm pulling for you. Stay optimistic!"

"Death is natural and not what most think. I've been there a few times myself and felt the same way. I think the fear is more because we face the unknown and that is the frightening part. As i was wheeled out on a stretcher towards an ambulence,  looking up at the stars, I surrendered. A great peace came over me. I woke up 3 days later after having my chest cracked open. My aorta had burst. 10 % survival rate. Still here for whatever reason. These days I wish I had kept going. Much love to you. Fear nothing. I can tell you this much. There is more after this."

"Whether you are a religious person or not is irrelevant, the fact that you have made peace with both options is what matters. I wish I could hang out with you and jus talk about whatever til you go in for surgery. No matter what the outcome, you have come to terms with it and I find that truly heroic. Not a lot of people can do that in your situation. I do hope you make it an have a full recovery from this my friend and I hope to hear from you again. If not, then I’ll see you again some day."
It's not wrong to be okay with a chance of dying to improve your quality of life. Hope things change for the better for you. Best of luck.

What are you thinking of doing as soon as you make a full recovery ? I am sending you positive vibes - everything will be ok :))
Let me guess. Next you’ll bring the war in the Ukraine into this somehow. Covid has nothing to do with this. Lost quite a few patients to it myself in the past 2 years.
"tumor    too͞′mər, tyoo͞′-    noun    An abnormal growth of tissue resulting from uncontrolled, progressive multiplication of cells and serving no physiological function; a neoplasm.    A swollen part; a swelling.    A swell or rise of any kind.    In medicine: A swelling; one of the four necessary accompaniments, according to the older pathologists, of inflammation—namely, color, dolor, rubor, et tumor (heat, pain, redness, and swelling).    An abnormal prominence existing upon any of the cutaneous, mucous, or serous surfaces in any part of the body, and not due to acute inflammation.    A swelling port or style; tumidity; bombast.    A morbid swelling, prominence, or growth, on any part of the body; especially, a growth produced by deposition of new tissue; a neoplasm.    Affected pomp; bombast; swelling words or expressions; false magnificence or sublimity.    a tumor which is ^(inclosed) in a membrane called a cyst, connected with the surrounding parts by the neighboring cellular substance.    The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.     Also See \* for better formatting.   [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/tumor](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/tumor)   We tend to think of number 9 when using tumor as shorthand.    A tumor enclosed in a membrane called a cyst, but connected with the surrounding parts.      Grammatically, I believe Tumor origin or root is swelling actually swelling. Because when something tumors... it bulges or swells out of place when using it as a verb as opposed to a noun."

"Good luck OP. I think you've got the right mindset about this whole thing. It's out of your hands and fear is a pretty useless emotion when you can't actually change the outcome. The Buddhists would tell you that death isn't a conscious experience, so in a cosmic sense, you've got nothing to worry about. The moment you die, death isn't your problem anymore."
"Holy shit OP! Really wishing you the best of luck and a speedy recovery. I've been reading through some of your comments and you seem to be wise beyond your years. You'll get through this surgery and anything else life throws at you.   I know what you mean about not caring about death. I had the same thing, where I knew I might die, and didn't actively want to die, but it was ok. I don't think people who haven't been close to death ""get it"".   Good luck.

"I am an orthopedic surgeon. Part of my training was at a Shriners hospital. We treated many patients with this problem. There is not a 20% risk of death with this kind of surgery, at least in the United States. I would question someone giving you that high of a risk. Given current risks in this country the most dangerous thing you will do on the day of surgery is getting in  a car to drive to the hospital. Risk of death with orthopedic surgery in a healthy young person is extremely low. I have yet to see any healthy young patients die during any orthopedic surgery.  I expect you will be fine and I’m sorry someone has scared you about  unrealistic risks."

"I'm sorry this is happening to you. I can't tell you I know exactly how you feel but I can give you a story. A year ago I got a concussion in a training accident(I'm in the military). My symptoms were very severe and I had to get an MRI. Well to everyone's surprise the MRI showed a cyst taking up more than half of my skull, I had less than half a brain and lacked very important parts. I had to take an IQ test with doctors and managed to score a 138 to their surprise, they thought I should have been dead with the amount of pressure on my brain. To this day I am constantly in pain, I can barely walk, I forget the names of those close to me, and I struggle in day to day task, but at least I'm alive. There is lots of beauty worth seeing in the world my friend. So from one person who's body is destroying itself to another, I hope with all my heart that you live."

"My brother is a pediatric-orthopedic surgeon, who did this exact surgery to a couple of kids with a 100% success rate. Yes.  100%.  He just told me that due to advances in just about everything in a modern OR (procedures for your particular condition, equipment, training, pre-op planning due to better tech from imaging tech, etc….), there’s a very high chance you’ll come out of this with less pain than before (after rehab).    Remember, those numbers are based off of decades of doctors needing to do something to those kids; and they have to tell you the historical numbers.  Those 20% poor souls were stepping stones that lead up to you.  Those kids didn’t die in vain because your doctors and the staff’s skills have learned from these case studies and WILL provide you with the best experienced care.  Obviously, there’s always a chance of complications with any type of surgical procedure.  But don’t worry about it.  That team will do its best and I truly believe you’re in great hands; because seeing my brother just power through with absolute determination to go through that intense ped-ortho training/residency weeds out even the best surgeons of this planet.  Whoever suffered through the classes, training, and hard work to become THE pediatric-ortho surgeon of your region is pretty much guaranteed to be among the top quality surgeons in the world who are always surrounded by an all-star support staff.  I’ll see you in a few hours buddy."
Packing and smoking a bowl for you.   💕 you got this!💕
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over."
Anything
"Bit of otherworldly advice; don't go to the light. Head to anything else, just not the light."
"We all die one day. Not everyone has the balls to live a life not afraid of it. Good for you.  You've got the right attitude kid. Either it works and things are better, it doesn't work and things get marginally worse/equal, or you die.         Fuckin way she goes."
You got this!!!
Good luck friend
You got this.   Beat the shit out of the surgery and walk out of it as a glorious man
You got this.
That sounds awful. I do see where you’re coming from. I think it’s great you have peace with the situation you’re facing. Continue to find peace and it will make everything a little less horrible. I hope to see an update in a few days from you OP! Good luck and may the surgery go as planned ❤️
"Good luck mate I'm rooting for ya, you're such a brave kid"
Sending you all the hugs and love!
Love you bro
"I felt the same way when going in for a double lung transplant, I was very calm.   It was either , this is it or this fixes it.  Either way the quality of life I was experiencing right before the surgery was not great. I was ready to assume any risks for the chance of feeling better and getting my quality of life back.   If it went badly I didn’t feel like I was losing much in the state I was in.  Anyways that was 15 years ago, and everything has been awesome since.  Don’t worry about what people say, you’re the only one that knows what you are going through. Best wishes on the surgery bro."
You’ve fucking got this mate. No matter what happens… you’re amazing and your dignity is inspiring
I'm a powerlifter. I hope so too.
Dude that's too dark even for me.
Good luck! looks like you have at least 19k people rooting for you
"I love you, bud."
Good luck bro
"I'm sorry I can't do more than give my best wishes and hand over my updoot, but hope you won't pass and make a full recovery"
Im a nurse who is very well educated and happen to have personal experience with chiari. Your statement is juvenile.
Please bro/sis update when the surgery ends
"And here I am thinking my life fucking sucks. Godspeed, hope to hear from you after a successful surgery."
"From one survivor to another, you got this brother. The sun will shine on you again."
"Being at peace with death without seeking it is the sign of a very mature mind. I suspect you're like that because of all the pain. May this work and may you have a lot less pain, so you can be immature, with the wisdom you've earned.   You sound like an amazing person."
Everyone here has complete confidence that you'll be laughing about all this tommorow. You have my best wishes as well.
Best of luck my man. Hope to see you back here tomorrow.  !RemindMe 24 hours  Edit: Happy you’re still around!! :)
"Good luck, OP  Hopefully the surgery will go well! You are one tough person. I admire your strength"
"god bless you, I hope you recover from your surgery❤️"
"Posting a bit late, but godspeed to you.  I'm going to follow this account, let us know in a couple days once you've recovered how everything went? I hope to see you do well."
"This is an excellent point! The statistics include a very wide range of cases. They also tend to reflect the state of practice a few years ago from when the statistics were being gathered, and may not reflect if there are new techniques.  My oncologist wanted to drive home this point for me because I was a young woman with a small tumor that was in a “high risk” location. But this cancer usually is found in middle aged men with much larger tumors in this location. My oncologist, in discussing the likelihood of recurrence said “I’d estimate it’s 1 in 4 that it will return. But I want you to know that I couldn’t even say that it is 25% because there aren’t 100 cases like this.”  (I’m now 6 years out with no evidence of disease, so looking pretty good so far)"
"Brother I am rooting for you, I know you don’t care what happens at this point, but there are plenty of people who do. I hope you can live a long painless life after this, as everyone in this world deserves."
"!remindme 4 hours  You better be breathing when I'm back.                                Being the same age as you, I can't imagine having to die now."
Imagine being so close to death yet feel the need to post on Reddit for karma lol
Please keep us update. Good luck pal
"You're actually an incredibly talented writer for 14. If you write anything else, like some fiction or something, I'd love to read it. Keep your hopes up, dude!"
U got this.
RemindMe! 7 days
Stay courageous. No judgement here . Hold on!
"I've been crying and whining about my rheumatoid  arthritis diagnosis for a few years now. Although it's no joke (the RA), your post definitely puts things into perspective for me. From perfect health to the most agonizing and deadly pain, I don't have it as bad as it could be. I should and definitely will try to stand up against it in a stronger, more positive way. The way that you are...   From one painfully sick person to another I am very proud of you and your decision. Your decision to do this will also give the professionals more practice and research into being able to help others like you. That 20% will drop over time due to the fact that they are progressing in their pracrice and ability to perform these treatments. Of course the only way to do that is to perform more of these treatments. You are a very brave person, and not only helping yourself but who know how many countless others that will come after you as well. The brave don't need luck, they are luck for others."
Good luck young one
"Good luck, and when in doubt, so as the romans did multiple times: stare into the pale face of death and tell it to wait it’s damn turn. You’ve got living to do"
"Whatever happens you can be sure this post has now been immortalized in the halls of Reddit fame and history and that’s pretty fucking awesome.   Best of luck, you got this."
"Please, have an award. You’re one incredibly strong person and I wish you a speedy recovery!"
Reddit is the last place to spend your last hours
Better get that reddit karma before you die am I right
"See you when you get back, champ"
Blessings to you.  I hope you get the outcome from the surgery you want.
Hope you live cuh live laugh live etc.
Best of luck Bro. I will be thinking about you during your surgery. I can’t wait for your update post after your recovery!
Best wishes to you. You are brave and i hope for a speedy recovery &lt;3
"Hey look at the bright side, you will get to brag about having metal ribs after this."
"OP, I admire your bravery. My heart is with you. I’ll be coming back for the update. Make sure they give you the good drugs."
"Dying is perfectly safe. No matter what, you'll be OK."
Sending lots of love and good vibes your way. You’ve got this. Best of luck on your surgery! We all look forward to hearing from you in your recovery ❤️
Wow you’re inspiring. Best of luck to you. Can you post when you make it through?? I’d love to here your outcome
"A 20 percent chance depends on the situation, a 20 percent chance of getting a item drop in a game is great but a 20 percent chance of dying is very not good"
I'm cheering for you now
"You are a brave and strong person, very beyond your years. I want you to know how amazing you are 💛. We're with you!"
"You got this, OP! Please keep us updated and we’re sending you all our luck!"
"Good luck, may I pray for you?"
"I hope the best for your recovery, but have you ever thought about the afterlife - what do you expect would happen when we all die?"
See you tomorrow. Looking forward to another post.
I stand by that statement. Also I’d rather trust my neurosurgeon than some rando con artist on Reddit. Take it elsewhere. No one here is impressed.
"Thank for sharing with us, you reminded me that death is only a part of life and that it shouldn’t always be feared."
I rolled a 4 for you. Good luck man.
It’s ok to feel that way
Whatever you are feeling is valid. Why would anyone *want* to feel afraid of death? It sounds like you have considered it and made peace with your situation. I wish you a successful operation and quick recovery. Godspeed. [I am shocked the removal of two ribs carries a 20% chance of death.]
"Seems the almighty has a bone to pick with ya. Hopefully you roll a nat 20 on that and recover well, and thank you for your time."
This is the most wholesome comment section I’ve seen so far on reddit and this made me feel like I take life for granted a bunch. Thank you OP for opening my eyes
"May your doctor's tools be sharp, their skills high and the hospital well equiped."
"My wife also suffers chronic pain.  I acknowledge and support your feelings about possible outcomes to this procedure. Living in hell like you have, indifference to death is natural.  Good on you for not actively seeking it. I hope the procedure has spectacular success and you find relief!  Looking forward to good news in 4 hours or so."
"You have achieved a level of peace that some people strive for their entire life. If you die, at least you know you beat them to it and you can go out giggling lol."
"In my opinion, you’ve handling it very well. I was once told not to invest too much effort on a particular outcome. I know you will soon be in a great deal more pain, I am so sorry that it will hurt, but I very much hope that the surgery is successful &amp; that it improves your quality of life."
Cheering you on!
"You got this, OP!  I’m looking forward to the update where you tell us how successful it was."
"We will be waiting to hear from you later , good luck"
Yes. So you’re saying.
I wish you all the best.
"""Do not go gentle into that goodnight"""
You got this dude hope you recover all of it
You got this man &lt;3
You better come back to us. We're waiting. Best of wishes.
What does “you got this” mean?
"I think you are very brave and I admire your mindset because I don't know that I could have the peace you do with it. Your friends just might not understand, but I think it is a skill to have looked into everything you have about your situation and come to terms with it. I know I would be worse off mentally. None of what I'm saying is meant to diminish what you are going through, because I think it sounds terrifying and thin you're really brave even if you're just waiting to see what happens. I will keep you in my thoughts, dude."
"Wish I had your balls mate. I'm terrified of death but you face it head on, you're a fucking badass man."
"You got it man, hope everything works out. Thanks for this post. #Strength"
"No one can tell you how you should feel. But I will say I fear is almost never a good  response to something out of your control. You’re meeting fear with love and understanding and rising above it. We’re programmed to be scared of death but that doesn’t mean you should or half to be afraid. I’m incredibly proud of you for your courage and spirit as a fellow human being. I hope you’re able to find the beauty even if all those around you might be sad and scared. Don’t worry about them, they just don’t want to live in a world without you because of how much they love you and how special you are to them. Whatever happens, good luck and god bless on your journey"

"Its okay to be at peace with the potential outcomes. It takes a certain internal strength to have that sort of resolve. That type of fortitude is why I think you'll probably survive. You just seem like you can take anything that the world throws at you. Seriously, your attitude is more mature than some adults in my life right now. Best of luck, and you got this!"
"Your friends have not faced what you are facing. They said what they said because they care about you deeply, but because they haven't experienced the type of pain you describe they can't understand your resolve to see the surgery through, no matter what. Try to remember that those folks care about you even if they can't see it the way you do. Good luck!"
You're brave. Please update
❤❤❤❤❤
I know I got a five sided die somewhere in my collection. Digging it out and rolling it for you!
"Best of luck man, please update if everything goes well :)"
"You will survive this, you are going to. You are going to beat this. You are. I believe in you. Your not dead yet, don’t let the em tell you different"
Hey..ur probably not gonna read this but Imma say a little prayer for you and smoke a bowl of the best bud in ur name. Your prob to young to partake but much love homey.
I’m not religious OP but may the Great Spirit be with you to get through this &amp; be laughing as you come to the light.Update us when you can please.👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
you can do this!! you are in my thoughts!!!
"You'll be fine mate.   I fully expect to see a post tomorrow once you come out of surgery and most of the anesthetic has passed out of your system showing us your ribs that they've removed. Even if they don't let you keep them, due to biohazard or whatever, they should at least take a couple pics for you.   And remember... Chicks dig scars. Just tell everyone who asks that you were bitten by a shark or fought off a grizzly or something like that. Or, you can tell them that a team of people in masks cut you open to harvest your parts. Like a horror movie. Ham it up, like they stripped you, drugged you, cut you open and took what they wanted, stitched you back up and you never saw them again."
Good luck to you on your next journey. Figures crossed this works in your favor.
"Best of luck friend. I'll be looking for your positive update down the line. I'm sorry you have been stricken with something so painful. I'll be think of you and hoping for the best outcome possible for you.    I can't say I wouldn't feel the same way you do in that situation. Just try to keep a positive mindset. You know what they say, mind over matter.  ♥️"
Keep fighting 🙏🏻
I believe death is you collapse into a ball of energy that feels like a really soft and relaxing calming sensation and that you are able to dream but the dreaming state is Different now because you can dream with others and see other dreamers.   So you will enter a realm which may be the 4th dimension actually it’s hard to imagine    But anything is everything snd everywhere I believe is what the 4th dimension is somewhat   I would say focus on a peaceful image to place you want to be or go and you will go when you past away   You think therefore I am   But if you believe anything is possible and think it’s important to have that mindset and be at peace so you belong anywhere and have no limits
"Good luck going through surgery, you are incredibly brave handling this at such a young age! Can I ask what else you do to help alleviate the pain? Are you permitted medical MJ or anything else that helps?"
Thats going to be a heavy load space cowboy
"In the name of Jesus , you meet the fate you are destined for. Stay strong"
"4 hours to go, best of luck"
"I teared up a little reading this post. Your positivity is contagious OP, praying for a successful surgery and quick recovery."
"Your friends' reactions are very human. Our species fears death, doesn't want to acknowledge it or face it.We shield ourselves in distractions and illusions, tell ourselves all manner of things to be able to function in our day to day lives, to dull the reality, but it is always there behind everything. Behind every pleasant day and experience, death is there waiting. So you see in order to function at all we have to do these things, so go easy on your friends. Being ok with dying is a great place to get to, if you can manage it. You conquer the fear and that is legendary."
"I am hoping for your operation to go successfully. You’re a fighter. You’re so strong, and I hope to see you posting again 5 years from now, alive and kicking."
You're a badass in the making and you'll have one hell of a story to tell in the years to come. Stay strong and good luck stranger.
Well you claim to be a physicians assistant who insults nurses. I have a hard time believing you are one. I’ve never met a PA or MD that would say such a thing.
This explains my bad luck with surgery.
You have the most incredible mindset and I think you are incredibly intelectual because of it. I wish you all the best of luck and to let you know that you are a wonderful being. I’m sure so many people are proud of you!!
May we all be as brave as you when we’re facing down death. I admire your courage in the face of this.
Gosh you are amazing
I’ll take those odds any day! Good luck OP! Give ‘em hell!

"People who do not live with chronic pain cannot even imagine what you go through every moment of the day. How every little thing is such an effort. I know people *are* capable of empathising without also having experienced the same thing, but it seems like those people are a very tiny minority. Most people just cannot comprehend without experiencing it themselves.... and that just compounds the situation... at least it does for me.   Anyway, you don't owe anyone. It's your journey. Don't let them guilt you into not wanting to live your life in pain just for their occasional enjoyment of having you around. IMO it's selfish on their part.   I hope it works out for both OP and you."

"Love you fellow human. See you on the other side, whether that's in 7 hours, or 70 years. Either way, it'll feel like the same amount of time when we get there."

You’re younger than me yet fearless in the face of something terrifying, and thats inspiring. Thank you for sharing your story. You got this man!"
"As someone who’s been extremely close to death i find it totally admirable that you’re at peace with the possibility of that outcome. Don’t dwell on it too much and don’t let it take away from your fight. Stand up and give it everything you’ve got. Let’s freaking go man, you got this!"
You got this !
"God speed, kid. I hope to hear from you again."
Your friends are wrong. It's fine to be okay with facing death. Best of luck to you &amp; I hope your surgery is successful.
Holy shit I wish I had that quick whit
I wish you the very best OP! Praying for the best outcome either way.
Stay strong my friend. You'll beat this.
I'm sorry you have to live in pain.   I hope you find relief.
"If this was meant to end you, then it would have long ago. But it didn't, cause you're tougher than the toughies, smarter than the smarties and quicker than the quickies.   Get in there. Get the work done. Recover. Go forth and rock my dude.   You got this."
"Good luck! I love the feeling of slowly coming to after a surgery. I'm happy we live in a time when modern medicine has invented a procedure that can potentially make your life easier. As others have said, your stoicism is admirable. See you on the other side!"
"Your friends haven't walked 1 step in your shoes, nevermind a mile. I have only the best wishes for you to have a successful surgery and a full recovery. If the worst should happen, I'm glad that at the very least you didn't make this decision out of fear or confusion."

I can tell you are a really thoughtful and wise young man. Im sorry this has been the way the dice has rolled for you so far. This could be a great opportunity for things to turn around.  Regardless I wish you all the best and applaud your way of seeing things at such a young age.
From a complete stranger to another complete stranger - I wish you the best of luck.

Replying with rabbit tracks in snow looks like hopping male lower bits.  Since I felt I ought to add something while I wait for update
"OP 20% isnt even that bad, I was born with TAPVR (extremely rare heart condition) in the 1980s, they literally did the surgery a handful of times globally at the time, my parents were told theres basically a 95%+ chance I would die during surgery at birth.  36 years later, I'm healthier then pretty much everyone I know and my heart is in pristine condition  You'll be fine, it's 2022, surgery has come a very long way since back when I had an extremely difficult heart surgery, and you're 14. I was 3 days old."
Thanks. So much. It’s a choice to get up and fight every day. I appreciate anyone who understands.
I would totally make the same decision as you. The chance at a better life is worth any risk involved. Wishing you all the best.

"yo dude I've got this same deal and had surgery way back in the day to help me and it worked as well as it could, I'm doing great today in terms of overall comfort.    the procedure was scary for sure, but you'll be ok and once you're on the other side you'll be recovering with a new hopefully better functioning body! you got this!"
Dude. You have steel moral.   Im 33 and I start crying when I think about my cata and think that one day Ill have to put them down.  You already have more maturity that I can ever hope.  You'll be fine my guy. Keep up posted ok?

Death is not the end my friend
"Good luck on your surgery or afterlife. I hope my comment reaches your eyes and you know that its alright to accept death. Once you do that, you live life to the fullest. While I want to say this makes life even more precious, debilitating diseases can really hamper things, so there’s nothing wrong with accepting that death would release the pain either. Whoever said its wrong to accept death is probably deathly afraid of death themselves, to an unhealthy degree. I accept death every time I drive because its a possibility. I barely comment much though so know that you’ve inspired me, I wish you luck on your procedure"
You got this. A candle here is lit for you and you are in my thoughts. I had a similar situation when i went for a cancer related surgery. My chances were really low too. But here I am!
I’ve never met a nurse with such willfully ignorant behavior but here we are.
"Hope you pull through okay OP. And if you do that you make a full recovery.  If on the other hand you do not, I hope you find the rest that you deserve after having fought so long.   Either way, I wish you the best."
I expect a full updated post after your surgery! You got this man
I wish you all the best and that you can stay at peace no matter what. I send you all the love that is possible.
"I'm looking forward to seeing your happy update-- don't leave us hanging, OP!"

"&gt; My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying  Eh, they’re not in your shoes.  I think they’re just worried that you’re more suicidal than you are (or claim to be here anyway), or are just defaulting to that thought process since that’s the one their own exposure to ‘thinking about death’ at your age touches on the most"
"Good luck , my friend. I'll be waiting for your positive update."
Proof? There was a post a year or so ago where someone (coincidentally a 14 year old as well) said they had brain cancer but it turned out to be complete bs

Good luck buddy.
I hope you make it 💙
"There is nothing wrong about your level of “Acceptance” when it comes to dying.  For nobody gets out of life alive.  Though, powers of belief still take its toll.  I guess it just comes down to this; what is making you continue? find a passion in life, and all else will fade away.   Best of Luck my man."
My son has MHE he had a couple of surgeries. He deals with pain everyday. He should probably have more surgeries but he decided against it. He just does his best to manage the pain that comes with this condition. The best of luck to you
You’re more articulate and impressive and strong than any other 14yo I’ve ever come across online or irl. I truly wish you the best. I’ll be thinking of you ❤️

Look at you you have made it 14yrs, some only make it months and days.  I will be praying for you and your upcoming surgery and future.  Stay strong and brave my man"
Live until we die is the only way to stay sane.    &amp;#x200B;  P.S. good luck
No I just found your is it worth it comment real dumb.
Best of luck my guy
God bless you and I hope that surgery is an incredible success
"This is not going to be the best post out there, and you might not even see it, but i will make it anyways for a kind of good luck.  First of all, good luck on you’re surgery!!! Second: i can’t say ‘i feel you’ because i simply haven’t experienced what you have experienced and are experiencing. But still , my thoughts are with you and i am coming back later to this to see if there is a follow up. I, probably amongst many others, hope that you’re surgery goes the best way it can and that you don’t have to experience too much pain ( or none, but what are chances of that lol ).  Sorry for the long post, hope this gets to you and i just want to say, that practically everyone here supports you and is with you. I think i can speak for all of us that we are expecting a follow up!  I’m not the best with words, so i’m sorry if i came over insensitive or something, just wanted to say good luck!"
"Can't wait for next week when you'll edit this post. You'll be more than Ok, I'm sure of it. Be strong brother, the strangers of the internet are with you"
"It is very VERY okay to be okay with death. That is considered having Peace. Your friends are young and afraid. Chances are, quite literally, you will not die. Even still, if you are able to maintain that peace about death past this experience, you’ll have a huge ‘leg up’ on your peers when it comes to coping with the most important aspects and challenges of life.   They will look back to these memories later in life and will find inspiration in your peace. Trust.  Edit: autocorrect"

You said nurses typically have poor bedside manner and think they know more than they do…. That was not in reference to me because you know nothing of my bedside manner or my education. So by saying that one can assume you know nothing about nurses or working in the healthcare field. PAs don’t insult nurses.

Best of luck mate!!!!
The odds are on your side and you sound like a really mentally tough individual so I’d say you’ve got this. Stay positive. You’re in my thoughts and I will say a wee prayer for you. I’ll be waiting for your update after the surgery.
Good luck i would be sad if operation fails
"Dear internet stranger, even though I've probably never seen you in my life and have no reason to reply, I will. The guts it takes to do this and be so calm about it is admirable. I sincerely hope it works out and you recover well, the world owes that to you. Now get your ass over there, prove the doctors that you're the best, and you got my blessing. I'll be asleep during the surgery, but I'll be praying in my dreams (not praying, I'm an atheist; hoping) Good luck, and hopefully we'll see you back around, cheers"
"This is sort of making me cry lol. I can't help but think of how strange life is. And here I was, sitting awake, thinking about how I have a final exam to give at just about the same time as yours. It really puts into perspective just how little we know or see and how we put too much emphasis on mundane things.  I think your young age is why the percentage went up, but rest assured that on a general basis it's a very low risk surgery, at least to my understanding.  Can't even imagine what you are going through and how much strength it would take to reach the same tranquil mental state as you are at right now. Your friends probably think the same and they think it's unfair that you have to ""pretend"" to be strong, they don't realise you're not pretending.  You're more than likely to make it bro, good luck. :)"
Nanban moment
"Hi Andrew.  First, you should know you are very brave dealing with all these at just 14 years old.  Second, even if it’s difficult, try to be positive about the upcoming and fight.  There is 80% chance of you living so it’s worth to try. I’m not an expert but, as I heard from my father and my siblings (who are doctors), if you are young and don’t have other problems that might affect the procedures, you will do well. I send you lots of love and I hope to see your update about this. Fighting!"
"You're awesome, brother. You've managed to find a silver lining when facing a horrible situation and for that I've got nothing but respect."
"It's ok to be content with death. It's something that a lot of people will never come to terms with. I think it's very mature to think that way, it's your place in the universe. There's something on the other side, we just don't know what it is.  I'll tell you a little story that hopefully relates and you might understand better than others at the moment. I had my appendix rupture, went toxic, almost died. Got out of surgery then had to fight off infection to stay alive. When I was getting ready to go into surgery I felt this overwhelming calm hit me and I knew I didn't need to worry, if I die then I die and that's ok. There's nothing I can personally do to not die. It was one of the most relieving feelings I've ever had. And if I come out the other end, then all I need to worry about is recovering....all the other BS is just that, BS. I guess what I'm saying is that it can be quite peaceful to be in that situation and not many people will understand you in that situation. Good luck, we're all counting on you to come out the other end."
Pedophile moment
It's just crazy to think what other people my age have to go through man
Good luck.
"You're confronting your mortality with more courage than any 14 year old I've ever met.   Your friends are being dramatic, and I can't really help you deal with them. Dying is 100% something we all do; you lived long enough to conceptualize it and be ready for it.   I wish you the best on your journey. You're either going to get better, return to the great sleep that most matter in the universe exists in, or pass over to some beautiful afterlife. In any case, the pain is hopefully coming to an end for you.  I'll be rooting for you little man. Be brave for your family, give the doctors and nurses a big smile before you go under, and write down any last thoughts or feelings you have leading up to the surgery.  You may feel some crazy waves of emotions and that's totally fine. I'm proud of you for facing this thing head on. Take it easy Captain Andrew."
You got this!💖 Lots of love for you and see you after the surgery!
"Just wanted to post this in case you read it brother but in my eyes you are an incredibly brave and admirable young man. There's no shame in being at peace with the possible outcome of death from a certain situation. It blows my mind that you've reached that state of maturity at a young age. I know the feeling because I to have experienced the same exact thing and when I accepted it I was more peaceful and could think clearer. My situation was different because mine was because we walked into a trap in Afghanistan, and my M4 had been shot and was no longer functional. So I sat there with a knife and accepted my fate that whoever comes around this corner will get my knife in their throat, but I accepted if it's more than 1 I'll probably die...but damn it I'm taking at least one down with me. Sorry for getting side tracked but I believe you will 100% make it through this because you are a very strong young man. Hope to see an update on this post from you after the surgery and a swift recovery for you brother."
Getting portions of your ribs removed is the real r/trueoffmychest.   Good luck!

There's nothing wrong with not being afraid. A lot of your friends probably can't imagine the struggle so far that you habe been through. The strength you display is admirable and I hope to see a post later showing you made it. Good luck friend
"OP, your stoicism is extremely admirable and I wish the best of luck for you. When I was 11 I had a cyst growing in my brain that blocked drainage from my brain to my spinal column. Mortality for children with this is extremely high because most parents would argue while the kid is screaming in agony, let alone the procedure to remove the cyst would’ve left me with a shunt coming out of my head had I not gone under a (previously) experimental procedure to remove it. This kind of experience (as I can see you have now) left me not afraid of dying. From someone who beat the odds, I believe in you OP."
"Never had a reason to say this, but probably no other appropriate moment: God speed, my friend."
"I wouldn’t worry about your friends. A lot of times, people (intentionally or otherwise) lack empathy towards something they don’t understand. To them, you’re suicidal unless you’re actively against or scared of dying. But unless they’ve ever lived in chronic pain, they probably won’t ever understand. That doesn’t make them bad people, just like you not wanting to be in pain anymore and being at peace with a negative or otherwise outcome doesn’t make you a bad person or suicidal or wrong in any way. No one wants to hurt all the time, and I’m sorry you are. I do believe this surgery is gonna go well and I hope it alleviates some pain for you (I’m an anesthesia tech, so I work in an OR while in nursing school, so I don’t know everything) 🖤✨"

"I was going to ask you to never believe anybody EVER who tries to tell you any of your feelings are wrong, but I think this different perspective is a healthy way to see your friends’ comments - misguided caring. Just in case, though…   Feelings can be helpful, unhelpful, distracting, frightening, comfortable, all kinds of adjectives… but not “right” or “wrong”.  You feel what you feel. What you choose to do about those feelings is where maybe others could righteously judge you (maybe)… But your feelings themselves are always valid and completely up to you.   Seems like you have a decent way of looking at your situation, and a healthy outlook. It will serve you well in what I hope to be a long, more comfortable future ahead of you! Good luck!"

I can't think to say anything that will help but good luck. I'll be eagerly waiting for your update."

We have bad healthcare in the US, reportedly according to Google, not as good as yours is in Singapore, so you should be fine.

"I have MHE as well and the surgery can be scary. It definitely helped me walk better. Weirdest thing afterwards was feeling the spots bone tumours used to be and they aren't there anymore. No more tendons/nerves rubbing over them like a guitar string. What to expect after your surgery: you'll probably have some skin numbness around where they worked on. I have a spot below my right knee where they made an incision, and a little bit of skin below/direction towards my ankle it is kind of numb from the nerves involved. But its not bad. Its just a normal thing after this kind of surgery. You might have some tingling afterwards. Like foot fell asleep type tingling but around the leg. It should go away. Im really sorry they're removing the ribs but it should feel better to not have fractures in them. The biggest difference to make the surgery better afterwards is going to be **Physical Therapy.** I can see some breathing exercises and leg stretches coming up. Things will get better and everything is going to be ok fam 👌Ask your parents if they can get the Medisafe App. Helps keep track of doses you take like pain meds and which ones are coming up at which time"

"Mad that you're okay with dying? What would they prefer? That you'd be terrified instead? Screw them. Everybody dies. You, me, anyone, all dead. Accepting that and staring death right in the face as you march towards it is an act of mature bravery. I believe in God. I will pray for you. Good luck man."
"I recently had complications they believe but don’t understand yet fully from covid which give me nerve damage the pain was constant and unbearable I toyed with the idea of suicide as the pain killers they gave me done nothing I’m a 33 male 2 kids my own business and a wife .  What I have is a drop in ocean to what your going through, your strong and you have a good head on your shoulders my best wishes and luck to you my friend. A great man once said do not be afraid of death just try and avoid it."
You should do a ama about your job. That’s so interesting
"Yo your bold approach to either light means you’re either going out stronger than I’ll ever be, or you’re coming out of this as someone I want to model myself after. You’re a full on Chad bud, and I want you to know that no matter how this goes."
"&gt; My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.  Theres nothing wrong with acknowledging your own mortality or coming to terms with it. In fact I'd go so far as saying it should be encouraged because it helps put in perspective how precious life is and allows us to appreciate what we have and what we've experienced, however long it may or may not be. Theres a wonderful book called ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and it's a series of interviews with Morrie Schwartz, a former sociology professor, as he progressively gets worse and eventually dies from ALS. It's deeply introspective, with discussions about mortality, death, our life, experiences, and what we should value and cherish. If you have the opportunity, I hope that you will be able to give it a read.  Given your ages I'm sure you're friends are afraid for the worst and you being content with any outcome is a new yet uncomfortable emotion they've probably not had to process before. Everyone processes, copes, and handles situations and emotions differently regardless of what side of the operation table you may be. Your friends clearly care for you and your well being.  Hope everything goes well and you experience a speedy recovery!"
"It's okay to be at peace with the odds I think your friends just fear the thought of losing you.  I just lost my first few close people and I'm 23 it really sucks, losing someone you care about isn't easy to process and I'd imagine it's even harder as a 14 year old kid even the thought of it must be daunting to them.  For you this is your life it'll either get better, worse, or you'll pass away in a fairly controlled and nonpainful way.  Even though this is like the worst pep talk I hope you come out of surgery better than ever and having kicked this diseases ass.  I hope you get to walk longer and longer to the point you can run a marathon if you want.  I hope you get to experience life and all it has.  I'm not a praying man but I am sending good vibes to you man."

How long is your procedure supposed to take?
I have MHE too never thought I'd meet another randomly on Reddit. I've had 5 total surgeries for my tumors and it has always helped. Yours sound worse then mine but I do have them all over my body you got this! And if you ever need to talk to someone who can relate message me.

"You young uns are flexible like that. The younger you are, the more you bounce, it's kind of weird. But also you could totally use this as an opportunity to guilt someone into getting you a sip of beer or something, even though that stuff's disgusting and probably not worth it but for a laugh"
"I have hope for you and genuinely believe you will make it, but I see no issue with the acceptance of death. It’s good that you feel a sense of understanding and peace with the concept. Being upset would just be stressful and painful. With that, the worst case scenario is having your last moments full of anxiety, and best case you live and have to deal with all of the upset you caused yourself for no reason."
You are one cool person. Keep it up

I had forgotten the pain I was in from breathing, eating and talking, and when I saw this it all came back as if it was buied away just awaiting to be opened again.      You are a brave soul, and while I understand the evenness of not hurting longterm anymore, I truly pray for your wellbeing, and recovery. Thank you."

So sorry about all the pain though.   My husband who passed away from a heart attack last April, used to be in constant pain too.  He had a tumor growing on a nerve in his back.  It's called a Shwanoma.  He also at one point had one in his heart called a myxoma.  He had to have open heart surgery for that.  He went into a coma for 6 weeks.  But he came out of it!  He lived with constant pain from the time he was in his 30s to his death at 57.  He got pills for it and they seemed to help him a lot.  I hope they can work for you too.  I wish the best for you and your family.  Huggggggssssss."

At that point just say yes to whatever they want to give you. Good luck little man."

Your life is your own. Doesn't mean you have to want it. I hope all goes well for you.
I work in the OR.  Every surgery has risk for death.  The reality is death is very very very rare in surgery even less so in elective surgery.  Obviously emergencies it goes up for obvious reasons.  It's okay to not be afraid.  I myself am still not comfortable with dying one day and I find you far braver than I.  That said you'll likely be fine and recover.
"Commenting so that I can see the update tomorrow that says you survived, and hopefully another edit later saying you’ve made a recovery and are able to live relatively pain free."

Whether you live or die on the table, you are not alone."
"Coming to terms with death can bother people. It’s not wrong but, it just usually happens when people are much older. Especially at the age you’re at, though, it can seem as if you’re suicidal to your peers even if you’re not. That being said, I’m sure you’ll make it through. People with much worse conditions and more invasive surgeries have and you can too. You’re young and your body (even with this disease) will have an easier time recovering than someone older. Just keep your head up and look forward to seeing the people you love afterwards. Even if it seems it might not help, that will to live for those around you can really push you through this.

God damn it I shouldn’t be just smoked two bowls. I have Hereditary Multiple Exostoses and I am currently living pain free. There is hope. It sounds like I got quite lucky and have only at surgery to repair a torn labrum in my hip that hurt constantly for 6 months from excess bone on my femur. I took a lot out of me mentally and recovery was a bitch but I made it through.  There’s always brighter times on the horizon.
Everyone is waiting to hear from you. 🌻 Hang in there.
Why downvote this comment? I think he typed 48 hours because the op is gonna edit the post and say that it went good
Hookers n blow is the way to go.
You got this buddy. I’m sorry you had to learn how unfair life can be at such a young age.  We’re all counting on you to make it through that surgery and come update us on how it went!   You seem like you already know this but you are loved! Good luck my boy!
Wish you the strength and optimism!
"Not being afraid of death is one thing. But baby don't be afraid to live!! Don't be afraid to fight for your life because YOU ARE WORTH IT!!!! Pray for strength, comfort, wisdom and faith. And pray for those around you who are willing you to live.  But I understand having constant pain. I have Hidradenitis Suprativa, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy and gout. And my pain may not be as intense as yours, but I get it. And it's a lonely place to be, even with people all around you.   You said there's a 20% chance you may die? Well live your best life with that 80% and party like a rockstar!!!  May the peace of the Holy Spirit rest, rule and abide in you. And may the Lord Jesus Christ give you strength comfort and the will to fight, live and overcome. Lord please be the steady hands of the doctor. Be their eyes to see, their ears to hear and their mind for knowledge and focus. And their heart for caring and understanding. In the name of God, Amen.  As my mama used to say, It is well with my soul."
I wish you the very best of luck.
we're wishing you the best outcome! keep us updated please

"As an surgeon that constantly treats that disease, the procedure is not that dangerous, believe me. Prob the doctors created that terror atmosphere because are in defensive mode, like a lot of doctors are. Painful recovery yes, but it is not a life threatening situation, believe me. Sorry for my English. You will be fine. Take care."

"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point. It's in fate's hands at this point.  Do these friends of yours know what it's like to live with chronic pain? This sentiment isn't exactly uncommon."

I hope it goes well and it’s really saddening that you have to go through a condition like this. You don’t deserve to be in agony. You’re very brave to go through with this and just know that people are cheering you on for this surgery and that we care about you
Good luck dude!
Hopefully you show your kids this post in the future!
Don't fear death since no one can live forever. It's great to live as long as you're supposed to be able to and to not commit suicide as that's a sin. But fearing death is pointless unless you're able to live longer by fearing it which is then good.
All the prayers I can send man 🙏
"You’ve got this man, I’m thinking of you and so is the rest of this thread. I know you’ll make it out"
I hope and pray that it is successful and that you make it through. May get the relief you want and be able to enjoy life without the pain. Bone pain and bone on nerve pain just sucks.
I hope you’re able to get relief from the pain. Good luck to you and your team of doctors.

Who quoted you 20% mortality? If you’re 14 and have no other medical problems that seems absurd.  Disclaimer - I’m an orthopaedic surgeon who’s done MHE surgery on 14 year olds.

Your attitude is incredible -- wishing you all the very best.

It's not bad to feel that way. It's a realistic view point and people often can't handle that.  I hope that the surgery will go well for you. Sending out positive healing vibes out into the universe for you.

That's the only reason I don't believe this shit. My son had 6 hours long open heart surgery at 6 months old...nowhere near 20% chance. Yet knees and ribs are 20%? I can't believe anything he says after that.
Andrew I wish you the best of luck with the surgery from Ireland. I can't imagine what must be going through your head but I hope after a successful surgery you have a much better quality of life. Ádh Mór a Chara!

I wish I could change things for you. Sending positive energy. You are loved.
"I’m an intensive care doctor. If you’re young and relatively fit despite your condition your risk will nowhere near be 20%. Heart bypass is 1-2%, aneurysm repair in the aorta is 5%. For bone surgerys away from big vessels you should be fine - worst case is a rough ride afterwards. If you are 70 and can’t walk upstairs due to breathlessness then 20% is reasonable. If you’re in your 20s-30s you should be golden, in your teens even better. Teens are bulletproof Good luck and let us know how you are after. You’ve got this (and so do your surgeons)"
Best of luck; light and love on whatever journey you embark
Good luck bud!
"That’s an honestly healthy perspective to take.  Being afraid of dying when you have to face something that is out of your control is the worst.  Accepting the outcomes whether it’s life or death, means the next several hours won’t be filled with horrible anxiety.  I’m glad you’re at peace with whatever may come 💝"

You have every right to feel any way you want right now. No one knows what it is like to be you. And your friends probably just don't know how to express their feelings for you.  I hope for the best possible outcome for you. Good luck young friend. You got this.

"Due to my previous occupation, I used to view death as inevitable at times, and this passage about death from Meditations used to bring me comfort:   “You have embarked, made the voyage, and come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation, you will cease to be held by pains and pleasures, and to be a slave to the vessel which is inferior as that which it serves is superior.” -Marcus Aurelius  Hope it gives you the same."

"I need a 2nd open heart surgery but when I had my first one almost 4 years ago at 23, after spending 4 days on life support and them doing last rights, I can say this: going in do your best to believe that you’ll wake up on the other side. I have GAD and a panic disorder, but for some reason as they wheeled me in, I too just had this acceptance. An eerie calmness. And I had my open heart while I was currently septic, so the outcome was very low. But a 20% chance is relatively low, and medically we have come so far. If you feel you have competent and capable surgeons, then you’ve got a great chance.   I really hope the best from you. I developed PTSD from going septic and life support, so just make sure you get the mental support you need after surgery. I didn’t and the last 4 years have been absolute hell as a result. 4 years of living in active heart failure bc I can’t bring myself to do what I need to for the 2nd surgery bc my MH has just been dog shit. (Not from the surgery but from everything before and after). My heart is with you and I hope your quality of life greatly improves from this!"
Good luck OP

"In my opinion (for what it's worth, I'm not a psychologist or anything) this is a healthy way to avoid extreme anxiety. I think you've clearly had a long time to think on this, and I hope you have a successful surgery. Your friends are concerned and understandably so, but it's your mindset that will be a determining factor in your recovery.   Good luck bud - I wish you the best."
"I see lots of responses, so this may not get to you, but I am going to write it anyway.  11 years ago I underwent quadruple cardiac bypass.  I had had a heart attack and had a stent put in and scheduled for surgery about a month later.  I thought about it often.  I dwelled on it a long time because I had feared it my whole life.  When I was young I had rheumatic heart disease and really didn't know much about it except that I may require ""heart surgery"" when I got older.  After 48 years of eating wrong and otherwise abusing my body, I had my heart attack.  It hurt.  After they told me about the bypass coming up I read all about it and it made me queasy.  Just knowing what would happen was bad, but knowing that any small error would kill me was real bad.  I ended up going in with a great attitude and didn't worry.  Recovery was painful, but i quickly recovered and I have no worries about perhaps passing away.  It took me a bit to get there, but I'm not 14.  I have ""life experience"".  I salute you and your outlook.  You WILL be fine.  We are all sending healing energies your way!  Keep us updated, bro!"
"I also have MHE.  It runs in my family.  My mom and sister both have it too.  My niece (10) just had surgery on both arms and one leg to remove the ""extra"" bones.  I have 9 in my right leg alone.  I had surgery to remove some of them off my knee several years ago.  My doctor has no idea how I can walk on my knee -- with the growths mixed up with tendons and joints.  My knee used to ""lock"" up when a my tendon would get stuck on the bone growths (which were sometimes shaped like hooks).  They couldn't take out all of the painful bone growths because some were too close to arteries so not worth the risk.  In college I sprained my ankle and went to the emergency room for an X-ray.  The entire radiology department on staff came down to meet me because they had never seen an X-ray like mine.  The good news about my surgery though is that the bones they removed did not grow back.  It greatly helped my ability to walk.  I can participate in most activities now and walk for miles.  Good luck on your surgery.  MHE is a difficult thing to live with, but surgeries can be life changing.  Recovery can be painful so take it easy."
And here I am thinking my toothache keeping me awake at 3am is bad. Hope you recover for the better. Thanks to my toothache I came across this post and a brave person like you. Good luck!   Hope to see an update from you soon.

"We are all thinking of you!  In general, we should all accept our mortality, whther now or in 100 years. You aren't saying you won't fight, you're say you'll do all you can and then accept the outcome... such insight we see through your words as to the fight you've given so far!  Some will say to be over the top optimistic. Some will say being a realist is key to managing expectations. I say do it how you see best. If you feel at peace, then be at peace with your decisions. You don't need to justify that  I tend to be both an optimist and a realist, depending on the day. Today I'll choose to eagerly await you updating us post surgery"

Best wishes for the most positive outcome possible from your surgery (a full recovery followed by a long life). There is nothing wrong with you being willing to acknowledge the possibility of a less than favorable outcome &amp; being able to face it with grace/dignity.
People who don't live a life in constant pain cannot fathom or relate to what it is like to live in constant pain.

"Your friends don't have any idea what you're going through. I have a genetic condition that has been plaguing me most of my life with chronic pain. What you are feeling is entirely normal for your situation, but most people- and certainly most people your age- have no idea what you go through every day. The idea of an illness or injury that doesn't go away is so foreign a lot of adults don't understand it. My own parents can barely grasp the idea I'm disabled and they've seen first-hand what I go through. They just can't relate.   What you are feeling is normal for someone in your situation.   r/chronicpain and r/chronicillness are great places to vent and talk to people who are in the same boat. Therapy helps, too, if only just to have someone to unload on that isn't a friend or family member that you have to put an act on for or risk weighing down.   Hang in there, buddy. You're going to be okay. And please feel free to dm me if you want to talk."
You can do this man
Godspeed. Stay strong you got this.
"You’re right, but also, fuck off, the sentence grammar doesn’t make the claim that OP also will “beat the odds”."

"The advances in medical procedures are totally in your favor. stay strong and positive, think about what plans you have for after this, bump in the road your young and your family, friends, and even folks here will be waiting for your return, recovery,"
You’re not wrong to feel okay with it. Your friends can’t completely understand what you’re living with.   You are incredibly brave and strong. I’m sure you’ll get through this and things will get better for you.

Yeah you'll do fine. Good chance you'll start feeling better after healing

"I have a few things I want to say  First off, best of luck with your procedure, I really hope it works out  2nd, like others have pointed out, you being young improves your odds of surviving this significantly, and I want to add it's unlikely a doctor would reccomend this surgery if he thought you weren't going to make it  3rd, there's nothing wrong with your attitude going into this. The result of the surgery is ultimately out of your hands, so worrying doesn't acomplish anything.  Again, best of luck and I really hope you make it through to read this"
Go little rockstar.
3 more hours now. Good luck!
Remindme! 24 hours
Don’t let having boneitis be your only regret
I hoping for the best for you OP!
Already done. And I posted this at like 1am none of the ppl I care about were awake lol
could you elaborate?
You got this buddy!!
"All the best with your op, looking forward to seeing your message after the op."
You’re in the hands of the doctors now and I have a feeling they’re going to do a spectacular job. You’re in good hands 😎
Ty (:
god speed
DUDE HAS MHE CUT HIM SOME SLACK! don’t worry my dude you only have to squat 310.
"I also have MHE and I totally agree with you about pain tolerance increasing over time.  I have no idea what it's like to not have MHE, the bones growths started as a young kid. Surgeries have helped my life so much.  I have never met anyone outside of my family who also has this condition---most of doctors I have seen haven't even heard of it."
"Hey if they give you a marker to mark your body before the surgery, write something funny on your body before you go under."
"I feel the same way and I'm not in any kind of pain. I have a good job, great partner, and I'm generally happy.   But if I died this very second I wouldn't care. Same with you, not suicidal, but life is finite. Death is infinite and just one more speed bump in our immortal existence."
This is the mindset of a warrior. Go fuck it up homie. You’ve got this.
"Good 😊 luck homie. Another positive if you come out of this, you’ll be a bad ass dude."
"I hope you get better, but it is important to know that if you die, there will still be a tremendous amount of pain, it just won't be yours."
Sending good vibes your way.
Im really sorry to hear your plight it suck people can just get horrible desises like this out of no where im very sorry for your suffering i wish you great lick and relief or at least a quick painless death either way i wish the bast for you
"There are Pain Managment centers all over and in places other than the USA.  Their doctor working with your diagnosis and your xrays, ultrasound, etc, will set up a treatment regimine for you  and within weeks if not days you will be getting relief from the pain. I want to ask you a serious question related to some of the things you have said. Do you believe that you could be happy without the pain? Could you lead a normal, life that would give you fufilment ?  Then get busy and look up one of the centers that are usually associated with the hospital chain that you go to."
"You fucking got this, I’ll be looking forward to an update soon! Fight hard! ❤️"
I wish you safe and successful proceedures and a speedy and successful recovery
"Best of luck, hope it all goes well."
"Your friends are wrong. Being at peace with death is what everyone should strive for.   That being said, I wish you luck with your surgeries."
I commend your courage and mentality. I wish you all the best fellow redditor.
"Go, OP, gooooooo!! You got this!!!!!!!!"

Ps sorry i cant spell
I am so humbled. No reddit post has ever brought tears to my (46 m) eyes.  God speed OP.  I'm done with the internet for today.
You shall prevail!
"The only thing I'll say is God Bless You, and if you don't believe I respect that too. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers... in the meantime, from one person who has had many medical struggles to another, here's a poem that has gotten me through:   &gt;“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.   And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.   And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.”   ― Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore"
I hope you find peace with God during your time or suffering. He will help guide you through this. Praying for you man. Praying for the best.
"Great views on mortality, comrade."
"Godspeed OP. I know it’s tough but I believe in you, you got this"

"Damn dude, I’m in my thirties and never had anything even remotely close to this. My son is a few years younger than you…  For whatever it’s worth, get better man. You got your whole life ahead of you."
"OP I am rooting for you and sending you all the positive energy I can.    If you can, read the book called “The Light Between Us.”  I listened to the audio book on audible. Death is nothing to fear, but I do hope you stick around for a long while.  Edited after update:  YAY!!!!  I’m so glad you’re alive!"
"You are so incredibly brave and strong. I don't think there is anything wrong with your mentality its important to understand and accept what you can't change, in fact its extremely mature. You're going to make it through this."
"Before you upvote his comment, looking at his comment history he has been replying to others comments every 2 minutes for 4 hours."
Please be back.
"You have an acceptance and understanding for life and your disease, that most who haven't been in your shoes won't understand.  If you feel at peace and okay then keep in that space. Talk to your parents/siblings and continue as the brave wise person you are. I offer my apologies and wish as much comfort to you as possible."

While I do not have the condition you have I did have a tumor in the bone in my left arm as a teenager. I found out by breaking it a little too easily in gym class. Turned out to be benign but it scared my family and I a great deal when it was discovered. It ended up “filling in” on its own. I hope you recover well and gain relief from this. Good luck!🍀
Ty (:
Sometimes when I’m on the throne doing battle I drop a few tears from the struggle as well.
Hope you make it. Best of luck in the surgery
"When your about to go under, please let us know. And if you make it out, tell us if you dreamed or not... I'm just curious. Also all of us are wishing you the best luck"
"Age REALLY has a lot to do with it. When I went on life support from heart failure, sepsis and an abscess on my heart valve, all of that caused my heart lungs liver and kidneys to fail. The Drs told my family that I absolutely would not make it through the night, did last rights and everything. And yet after 4 days, I just bounced back. I was still septic and needed the open heart surgery but I wasn’t literally knocking on deaths door."
Tysm!
I strongly support an AMA about something that could be massively educational.
I strongly support an AMA about something that could be massively educational.
Thank you for your honesty. I find your acceptance of the situation quite inspiring. Too often we can get bogged down by our 'problems' when in reality most of us live quite healthy lives free from disturbances.   I think you might relate to (and potentially get a lout out of) r/Stoicism
Hope it all works out.
"I am just over double your age and even with my additional “maturity” I can’t begin to put myself in your shoes. Best of luck to you with your surgeries, hopefully it all works out for the best."
Good luck bro. I’ve considered death over stubbed toes. Am I a wuss? Yes. Are you? Prolly fuggen no. Good luck.

Don’t let anyone talk you out of your wisdom kid. You know more about being an adult and a “real-man” already than most guys I knew at 35.  I think this planet was too easy for a spirit as strong as yours.  God speed you wherever you are needed next. We’ll work hard to live up to your courage.
As someone who is in chronic pain the well if I die part at least there is no more pain made me cry reading it I’m sorry OP.   I’m sending the most positive vibes and hoping you pull through this for the better hopefully gaining relief. Good luck.
"First off I'm sorry bud I couldn't imagine, ... Secondly you are valid for your opinion on death , NOBODY I mean NOBODY can tell you how to feel about your life, I think I would have the same additude tbh  , fuck it why worry about things outta control, btw I will be praying for yah kid,"
I heard of your condition before from guy who treats his with cannabis. I don't know if it will work for you but maybe in the future it's something worth trying out and see if it works  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLwWfXf9Ec4
"Hope you can run around in a few months (or however long it takes)! If not, running around in heaven sounds dope ❤️ Good luck"
the fact that she survived make the odds of OP surviving smaller
"Well, dying is actually not that bad. I read here on reddit stories from ppl that died and were resuscitated. Turns out, when you die you feel something like a cozy  feeling of warmth and  it feels like something that you already know but had forgotten.   It is probably because DMT gets produced in your body at that moment."
Praying for you buddy.
God speed mi amigo.
HEY MAN! WE'RE ALL WITH YOU! GODSPEED!   we are all with you bro! Heads up!
I’ll be thinking about you man
You're insanely brave for a young person. I wish I had that courage and I'm nearly double your age. Thinking of you and praying for the best.
"I strongly share your uncare of living.  I don't desire death, but I feel indifferent about it.  Really can't even decide if I would of wouldn't mind a slice of death replacing my midnight snack.   I'd expect a higher incidence of this perspective amongst the terminally ill but I never considered I wasn't the only chronically ill person who felt this way.  I hope your surgeries provide you relief!  Take care!"

My only regret....is that....I have....boneitis...
"Everyone around you is afraid, afraid they might lose a friend, a family member. Right now you’re Bruce Wayne in the pit. If you don’t fear death then you can’t make the jump. Hell I’m afraid that someone like you could lose everything. But what the hell do I know. I don’t know who you are, or what you’re going through. I don’t even know how to encourage you lol. But I hope I did. Be Batman motherfucker. Godspeed, I’ll see you around."
Ty for all the prayers. Appreciate it!
Keep the ribs and use them to make knife handles.
"There Is Always a Chance, that this May go wrong...but damn it, you said it right, it can also get A LOT BETTER! Go for it, i wish you the best of luck And the most skilled doctors and i hope to hear only great news from you, once you wake up from the narcosis.

"You're young, you're gonna make it. Hell, you could even ask them to do some.. upgrades."
Good luck sir. You are very brave
This posts reminds me of my freind Steve who had since passed on. Steve had Ms from a very young age which he ended up developing blindness from as well. He could hardly walk when he was in pain but he never complained once in the years I knew him and he was so generous and kind. He never deserved to go through such agony and die at only 28. I miss him dearly. I wish I could do something about the pain you feel but I brought up Steve because I feel awful his existence was so painful for him but I don't know who I would be without him. It's selfish of me to say and it brings tears to my eyes even though it's been years. I dont think he ever understood how much he changed my life fir the better. You night be only one person but you're life matters now and for your freinds and family you will always matter. Good luck
"Calm your shit, mate."

"I look forward to hearing that your surgeries went well and you are feeling better. In the meantime, I think your acceptance of your situation is very practical and even beautiful.

"I’m with you in spirit. It’s ok to be scared.  My first surgery, at 16, terrified me. That all went away once I was in the room, about to be put out. I saw all of these doctors looking down at me and I felt very secure. The way they looked at me was as someone would look at a loved one or something they care about.   They asked me to count down from 10 and I didn’t get past the last syllable of 10 before I was out. All I remember after that was waking up in recovery, feeling very very sleepy because of the pain meds. I’m 33 now and grateful for having taken that risk, because my life without it would not have been a life for me."
"I see power in your acceptance.  You inspire me.  I see you have 2 more hours before the surgery.  I wish you the best outcome possible.  In your mind, you have already achieved that.  This humbles me to the core.  I'm 54 years old.  I've learned something from you today."
"It’s not bad to not fear death, it’s going to happen to all of us at some point in time so it’s probably best to be at peace with the idea. However, I do hope for you that you get a best case scenario and get to keep living life with hopefully less pain. Sending virtual hugs (if you’re okay with that). 💜"
"My mom and were talking the other day. She said that the biggest factor for people “at the end” was their desire to continue living, or not. She said when my grandmother died, that she had thrown in the towel mentally, and her body followed shortly thereafter. With that said you have a very strong mental attitude. You are going to do great on life."
Every living thing dies. Being okay with it is a sign that you have given it thought and reconciled with your life. This brings a measure of peace. Good luck and fair winds friend.
I'll see you back on this post soon.
it’s been 4 hours so your not dying?

"I’m not religious at all. But I came close to death when I was 12. Really, I SHOULD be dead and there is no logical reason I’m not. I won’t bother explaining the incident but in short I should have fallen to my death. I did fall. From very high up.   But I was fine. Not a scratch. I don’t know how because I was “shut down” for lack of a better word. I couldn’t see. I was removed from the situation and relived my life up until that point. It felt like I was gone for years.   When I came back, I was standing safely without a scratch. I wouldn’t believe it if it didn’t happen to me but somehow, I was gently placed down.   It made no sense. Afterwards I was shaking for the rest of the day. I knew something I could never explain had happened.   It changed me forever. After that, I thought I was invincible. And I kind of was.   I knew that someone - or something - had my back. It wasn’t my time to go.   So to me it seems our time to go is when it’s our time to go. But we don’t know when that is.   I think if you’re meant to survive this you will. If you don’t, it may be your time and maybe you’ll get some answers. Maybe visit the Bardo Pond (which I’ve also had dreams about) and get to choose your next life.   Whatever the case, I hope it all works out. Good luck dude 🙏"
You’re wise beyond your years. Hope you can stay with us and teach us. Thanks for sharing.
"Never really like to comment on here, but I want to say that your post has moved me. I hope the surgery goes well and I hope you make a full recovery. You’re love and wanted in this world and many people would miss you very dearly. I wish you the best of luck my friend. If there’s a higher being in this life, may they be by your side the entire time. Much love. ❤️"

"Thanks for sharing your story and outlook  You've basically arrived at the /r/stoicism philosophy all on your own.  There's nothing wrong with contemplating or accepting your own death.

"Eventhough I am completely fine, I have also made peace with the fact that I’ll die someday. If you make peace with your mortality (especially early on), it’ll make every second count twice as long.   I’m praying for you man, and I’m an atheist so I dont do that very often ;)"
"Is this also known as ""Gardeners Disease?"" They said I have ""desmoids"" and are watching me for that disease.    I'm really sorry you are going through so much fear and pain.

"Do not go gentle into that good night.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
"I think many of us have been thinking of death a lot more lately and while it's not the ""dying"" that scares me, it's the ""not being alive"" that kind of does, that probably doesn't make sense or maybe it does. To face this and live with this illness at such an early age is very unfair.   Regardless, everyone, including myself, wishes you the best and a speedy recovery."
"Good luck my friend, I wish you a successful operation.   Glad you do not fear death, but hope you have a chance at a pain-free life.♥️🙏"
I don’t think it’s wrong to be ok with dying I think it’s just facing the worst possible scenario so anything else that happens is just a happy surprise- but the bad can’t hurt you- look up the stockdale paradox about prisoners of war And who survives - it isn’t the optimists it actually helped me survive facing prison time but it can apply to any difficult situation
"If there is any luck or hope in my body. I hope you get it , good luck and stay strong"
If only it weren't for the god damn boneitis. Good luck on the table.

I will be praying for you during your procedure. I do not know whether or not you are religious; I respect your beliefs either way. But that is what I will be doing.

"I understand that you’ve made peace with all the possible outcomes, OP, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  As someone who has experienced a medical miracle during surgery, I want to let you know that sometimes life says *”Not today, not on my watch. Today we throw out the odds book and make a miracle.”*  It happens.  I’ll keep you in my prayers, friend.  God bless."

"I have MHE too and have undergone four operations to remove tumors from my arms and legs. Last one was a year ago. It sure is scary.  I know how shitty and painful this illness can be. I've lost my ability to use the fingers on my left hand three times. Twice the surgeons were able to restore them fully, but I can barely move my index finger anymore. Last year I sat down on a chair and a spiky tumor in the back of my thigh punctured a muscle and lodged itself there lol. I was in absolute agony for a month. Standing, sitting and lying down all hurt.   So from a fellow sufferer I wish you all the best and hope your surgery goes well and is able to relieve your symptoms and pain. You got this."
You've got this kiddo!
"You’re a brave soul, good luck"

"You got this, OP!  Can’t wait to see your next post. I imagine it’ll be full of excitement for new possibilities."
Good luck!! They doctors will do you proud!! I hope the pain is manageable when you wake up along with a fast recovery!
I hope this doesn't sound too simple or trite but good luck. I really hope you get the best possible outcome.

"You’re more mature at 14 than a lot of people I’ve known twice or three times your age. Everyone relates to death in a different way, I think reaching the point of acceptance is somewhere everyone should get ideally; there’s no amount of fearing death that will prevent it.  Hoping for the best for you. You’re brave as f***, and if you don’t know that already, it’s probably because you’re brave af. You’ve got a better chance of living than dying, but if you see the big guy, tell him “Hi Dad” for me and politely ask him “What the f?”"
"I don't think what you have found is a bad thing at all, you have found peace, it is a wonderful thing that you have been able to achieve in such a hard time. You have enough people around you to worry about all the details, you don't need to as well. I think you are extremely brave and I wish you all the best. Hold that place of peace, it will get you through anything."

"Don't die bro,  choose life.  Much love."
"My wife worked in the general surgery department of a hospital for a while. She would see people who would say that having stitches or staples taken out was a 10 on the pain scale. Meanwhile, you are over here describing having your nerves and muscles pierced as a 5. Do you see what a total fucking badass you are?  This surgery doesn’t have shit on you. You are exactly the type of person that will pull through, take their rehab seriously and be up and walking in no time. You don’t need luck, because you’ve got this, so I’ll just wish you a speedy recovery."
"Hi baby hope everything goes well, if not, see you in our next lives. ❤"

"all the best. whatever the outcome, i hope you are happy with it"
We're gonna all make it brah

"Good luck man, after the surgery will you update us on how you get on?"
"My dad's been through a lot of surgeries when I was growing up. A lot of surgeries back in the 70's and 80's when modern medicine was still in its infancy really. He had a lot of procedures that had much higher percentages of death. One surgery did go wrong and they had to rush him back under the knife.   But he's here. He's more or less healthy. He's had plenty of 20%, even into the 40% area. But he survived.   This isn't about luck or probability. This is about you having doctors who have spent a very significant time of their life training and learning to care for and save people lives. They have their whole career, their whole wellbeing rides on these things. When a surgeon does a surgery and the patient dies it's not just a ""well, shit happened"" type thing. These doctors know there is a lot to get right and a lot that needs to not go wrong. And that's their whole job.   Their whole job is making sure they do their best with all their knowledge and experience to make sure you survive and get better.   I'm not saying any of this in any way to diminish the weight of the situation. But I'm wanting to show you that while it sounds scary, that 20%. It's really not that bad. You have a room full of people with tons of experience and training whose whole job is to keep you alive.   We'll hear from you in a few days when you get some of your strength back. No doubt in my mind!   We'll see you then!"
Godspeed dude. Hope you come out on top.
I think this is gonna be the first time I pray for someone. I hope you survive this and live a long life.

Don't let anyone tell you how you should be preparing for this experience, just know that we're all rooting for you and wishing you the best."

"I've had around 5 surgeries because of exostosis. Several that were over 4 hours long, one to remove a massive one from my hips that really impacted my movement and walking. I lost a lot of blood too during that surgery especially but they just sent it through some machine, cleaned it and back into the arm it goes, or so they told me how it went after surgery. It sucks because the healing takes quite a while because cutting out so much bone(ish) material destabilizes the bones and joints that it's removed from but that's already the biggest risk. The risk of breaking something after surgery. And even that happened to me. Had to get another surgery where they had to remove some bone (marrow?) from my hip bone and implant it in my arm. Sucked big time but really, chance of dying is really not anywhere near what you think or were told. My brother has it too and it evolved into cancer for him. His chances of surviving the surgeries to remove the cancer caused by exostosis is much lower than 20%. So really, just get some rest and allow your bones to heal after the surgery.   Source:    * 2 surgeries in right lower arm   * 1 surgery left shoulder   * 1 surgery right knee   * 1 surgery left hip, left knee, left ankle  Also, the pain you have now, I kinda had that although maybe not that bad. I couldn't walk up the stairs anymore though so it wasn't exactly nice. That went away after I stopped growing without any surgical intervention."
"God be with you bro, be well."
Hey be careful when you wipe and don’t accidentally use a dirty piece to wipe your tears

Idk I had reconstructive bone surgery didn’t do anything for me. Feel like doctors just bullshit the numbers and no surgery truly works. Hopefully yours works though
"Better hear back from you after surgery, all the luck to you."

The best way to go into this is accepting that you could die because it is a possibility. There isn't a lot you can do about.   I do the same thing when I get on a plane the only differneve is the odds are a lot less for a plane crash but itsbthe same idea.  There is nothing wrong with it. Good luck! We expect an update when you wake up from surgery
You will be!
You got this dude!
I hope you make it and improve. Life has a lot to offer if you’re in the condition to enjoy it.   I also applaud your acceptance and stoicism in regards to the worse outcomes. Your friends are wrong honestly. You certainly don’t seem to have a death wish but you’re in touch with the reality of your situation and you’re not letting it crush you. That’s a win.   Whatever the outcome I know that you’re going to be more prepared for it than not and that’s better than most folks get. Good luck in your surgery. You’ve got this.
"Hey good luck with your surgery! I certainly hope you pull through.   Btw don't pay attention to your friends saying you should or shouldn't feel a certain way about death. People who don't live with chronic pain/illness have absolutely no room to comment on the way those of us who do should/shouldn't feel about anything!  Anyway, pls let us all know you're ok if you make it through (as soon as your recovery allows of course). We're all rooting for you! ♡♡"
"Can't say much expect I wish you luck and that you pull trough operation. Stay strong, believe in yourself and hope for the best."
I'm happy you've come at peace with your decision but I want you to experience this life without such pain and worry again. I'm pulling for you to make it. Your words here today mean so much to people that have and will read this.

The lack of stress hormones may actually help you during the surgery. I hope it goes well and that you get some relief.    And screw those people who refuse to comprehend what you are going through. This crap we have as a religion based society, that you have to endure excruciating pain until your body craps out and medicine can't keep you suffering any longer, is BS."

"My father had cancer twice in his life. Lymphoma when i was a kid, and Meseotheiloma when he passed a few years back. Each time he had it, he exhibited the same reaction/emotions you have. I dont fully understand it, but i do at the same time.   In our culture, death is just another part of life. It isnt saying goodbye forever. My father taught me that no one is every truly gone when they pass. And i think that belief allowed me to feel some of that peace he was feeling.  I wish you the best outcome in this surgery. But it seems like no matter what happens, you will be at peace."
You got this OP. Much love from New Zealand xx
Good luck man. Praying that you respond to me tomorrow. RemindMe 1 day
I wish you nothing but peace no matter what the outcome. You are incredibly brave.
Best of luck man. You are facing death and are unfazed with its gaze. Your braver than most.

You are a remarkable person.
"I am 56 years old, I contracted Lyme disease when I was 22, no one knew what it was or even how to treat it where I live in the US at that time. I was treated for the flu, ring worm, bacterial and viral infections and just about everything else I think. Antibiotics would force it into remission for a week or two and it would come back in another area of my body. The night I ended up in the emergency room with Lyme carditis, (heart failure), I was fortunate enough that the intern on duty that had learned about the disease and recognized it immediately. Laying in the bed I overheard her telling my mom to start planning for the worst and hope for the best, she gave me 20 to 30 minutes to live, best case scenario I wasn't expected to see the next day. I had wires and tubes in me and on me everywhere and once everything settled down and they had done everything they could for me I was wheeled into a dimly lit room by myself, the room they put people in right before they pass away. No TV, no radio, nothing but lots of space for doctors, nurses and eventually family to pay their last respects.  I laid there for a while, afraid to close my eyes not knowing what was going to happen next. The doctor didn't expect me to live so if I closed my eyes would I die? I'm not afraid to admit it, I was scared! Eventually a very calm, peaceful feeling took over and I re-lived my entire 22 years over from my earliest memory. I didn't know what time it was or how long it took but when it was all over with I was completely at peace and wasn't afraid to die, I also wasn't going to let a little deer tick do me either, but at that point everything was out of my hands pretty much. Obviously I lived, and I did fight back hard! Thanks to 12-14 doctors, many nurses and my will to survive the Lyme bacteria was put in remission for 20 some years. Very slowly it started coming back out in my 40's, I passed it off as old age setting in. When it started affecting my sleep, affecting my life and my work I had no choice but to go in to see a doctor. Right off the bat they found Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes oversensitivity in a person's nerves. Forget about ever sleeping more then 1 or 2 hours at a time, certain points are ""pressure points"" push them, I jump. Other places feel like a hot knife being pushed in. Still no one could explain the ""balloons"" on the ends of my arms. It looked like rheumatoid arthritis, the redness and heat it gave off indicated rheumatoid arthritis but I tested negative for rheumatoid arthritis, I tested negative for Lyme disease too. Eventually I found a rheumatologist that diagnosed me with ""gram negative rheumatoid arthritis"" and started treating me. As both of us learned over some time, a few emergency room visits and another near death experience, with Lyme disease that is in remission, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia that is from the Lyme disease I can not be treated with the auto-immune drugs typically used to treat RA. Lyme bacteria is ""opportunistic"" bacteria, meaning it hides in a person's body looking for weak points to attack. If my immune system is compromised in any way it comes out. If I get stressed, stress activates the bodies immune system, certain areas become vulnerable and the Lyme bacteria attack it.   I realize your condition is completely different from mine, however I too live in constant pain every day, mine varies daily from a 5 to ""I wish I was dead"". Those days I have all I can do to get from the bed to a recliner where I usually spend my day meditating and sleeping. I have also found hemp oil to be extremely helpful in my case. I hate popping pills so I go for a more holistic/natural approach to pain control.  I'm sorry for the length of this too, I just want you to know that you are not alone.   Keep a positive attitude and keep fighting! At 14 you still have a lot of life to live and a lot of things to experience in life. Learn self hypnosis and ways you can manipulate your own brain to block out pain. Basically enjoy every day, try not to think about your condition and live life to its fullest.   I wish you luck and many, many, MANY more (pain free) years of life too!"

That being said, I think it's a good thing that you are okay with the fact that you possibly won't make it. I've been a pediatric nurse for 17 years and have unfortunately seen kids pass away, some who were ready / at peace with it and others who weren't. I think it makes a big difference for your family to know that you are okay with it if the worst happens. I can't imagine losing my son, but if it did ever happen, there is no doubt that knowing he had accepted it would make it a little easier for me to go on living without him. Sorry that you have to deal with this horrible disease and again, I'm hoping for the best for you!"

"I just wanna say i dont think theres anything wrong with being okay with death in a situation like this. Facing the odds and preparing for the worst is very different from giving up.

Omg I have this disease too I want to get surgery. I have it better than you but I have no flexibility I can’t even sit pretzel style or turn my legs out. It’s upsetting when you can’t participate in things you want to do because you can’t physically do it. It also hurts. I can feel them when I walk and get sharp pains from it hitting a nerve. My hips hurt my knees hurt my back hurts all because of it.  I hope to surgery goes well! (I’m so glad there are other people out there that I can relate to with this)
All the best OP. Your optimism is inspiring. Best of luck to you. Looking forward to an update.

"I know the feeling. Not that I am on deaths door, but I have lost so many people. My sister, my husband, both of my parents and many friends. Hazards of being the youngest I suppose. Still I have watched so many die that I am no longer afraid. Those with near death experiences tell about how beautiful everything is, and I have seen so many talk to people long dead hours before they pass.  I honestly feel like it is simply passing from one dimension to another. I'm not religious at all, but there is a lot of things too similar between stories of children with past life experiences and people who have had near death experiences, and being around people who have been actually dying to dismiss it all as some physical phenomena. I truly believe that our self, soul, spirit, whatever you want to call it is immortal, and when we die we leave this mortal meat puppet behind. So I am not afraid of death either, and would absolutely welcome it, but would not do anything to hurry it along.   Whatever happens may you be at peace."

Keep your head up and I'll keep you in my thoughts.

"Chronic pain is awful to live with, and I don't see people talking much about the mental health aspect of it.   I was never in any way close to your situation, but I remember when one day I woke up and I couldn't move. I could barely turn my head I was in so much pain. When I eventually had to move to use the bathroom or go to the doctor, I would scream in agony. I was only like that for a month and I was completely resigned to die. I turned into a hollow shell. I'd just stare at the walls or sleep to pass time. My parents watched me waste away. They'd sometimes just sit by my bed and cry as I stared blankly at the ceiling.   And that was a month. There are people, like I imagine you op, that continue to do this for years on end. You have a strength I'll never know. Pain is truly the biggest test of character in this world. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best. What a wonderful life you could live if you could walk without the pain. I know you're resigned now, but I really do wish that for you. I hope to see you writing again soon."

"I just wanted to say you're not crazy, suicidal or wrong for being ok with dying. You've simply accepted death as an option, which is actually quite a testament to your strong will. Not only have you fought that fear most of us rather run away from, you've also managed to avoid depression at the prospect. And obviously, living with such a crippling disease and constant pain is another victory.  So hey, you're already on a winning streak in my book. No reason to stop now ;) Good luck!"

Because it would probably be too late to fly to Switzerland, I  would try to find somebody here to help me. Living with pain is horrific, and nobody deserves that.   So I wish you the best connected with the profound hope that you feel better after the surgery  Warmest greetings, and kudos  Heidi"

"My thoughts are with you. I hope surgery gives you more freedom. I’m looking at possible neck and back surgery for my chronic pain. It’s scary and I’m in pain but it’s nowhere near what you’re experiencing. People don’t realize how much mental fortitude it takes to get through each day, much less enjoy it as much as you can. Death is a shadow that follows chronic pain sufferers, reminding one of the inevitable but also of it’s relief."
"Based on this information, if they told him 20%, I hope he gets surgery from another doctor who gives him a way better %. Maybe these ones are inexperienced in that kind of work and that’s why it’s higher?"

This is a very hard thing for me to wrap my head around, and, while I try to reason with myself, I am anxious to think of my own inevitable death someday.

I hope you are happy and at peace with whatever outcome turns out to be true. I don't know your feelings about what your friends have said, but I'm sure they only object because they don't understand the peace that you've come to have and they are worried for you and want the best for you.

"I have only this to say. I hope you live of course, but I’m glad you can go into this with a sense of peace. There may not be many good months or years left on this planet anyway. Perhaps going to sleep isn’t the worst way to leave us, as we are on the brink of nuclear war, and climate change about to end us anyway if that doesn’t… the future hardly exists in any hopeful way. I hope you felt loved. I hope you laughed until your face hurt as many times as you could. I hope you remember all the delicious food, the smell of fresh cut grass, of salt water spraying your face, of a puppy wriggling around in your lap, a great book, your favorite movies. I hope you felt more joy than pain in this life. I do believe there is something else in the multiverse that gives meaning to our existence and that you have existed here for an indescribable reason.   One of my favorite quotes is from Dune: Fear is the mind killer.   On the 80% chance you return, you’ll be proud of yourself that you faced this adversity with bravery! Good luck and safe passage."

"Hey buddy! 👋   I sincerely hope everything goes well for you today. I’m deeply sorry that prior to this surgery you’ve experienced so much pain and agony.   I just wanted to chip in and say that when I was born I had a 10% chance of surviving. I have bronchitis and had to have numerous blood transfusions…  I have no memory of it at all, but my Mum does. She said that the 10% chance of me living was worth absolutely everything. I was expected to be heavily disabled if I did survive… I turn 25 this year and the only “disability” I have now is slight asthma.   I hope the surgery works and gives you a much better rest of life. Please, please drop a reply to this when you’re able to.   I pray for an update - it would be heartbreaking for things to not go your way, even more so at such an incredibly young age. Stay strong and good luck."
"Consult your inner warrior tell him to come forth. For it is he that will ensure your survival. However, it seems you are partially there, as you do not cower before death. So young blood. Show us what this warrior is capable of and ensure that you come out alive and kicking. No other outcome is acceptable. The odds are what they are. But the human spirit transcends even those measly numbers."

"While I was in the military, I hurt my back. I spent the last year I was in walking to work (car had a blown motor), sitting somewhat upright at work, walking home, and laying down.  I was in so much pain, but none of the military doctors thought there was anything wrong with me. I had x-rays and MRIs, but they didn't see anything.  For many years, I remained in pain, and I prayed that I would die because I didn't have the strength or bank account to kill myself. Pain makes you think some weird ass shit man...I hope your surgery is a success, and you can recover quickly. Try not to be an asshole afterward. I really became one after all those years in pain and its hard to unlearn."
Godspeed OP. Wishing you the best of luck.

"Its not wrong and good for you for addressing it, a lot of people would try to brush it off or wash it away with hopeful thinking but the unfortunate issue is that the situation is pretty serious. Without minimising the impact of potential side effects on your quality of life you still have good odds.  I had to have a liver transplant back in 2019 and I had been quite sick for a while before. Just at the end of school when I was supposed to be doing my a-levels I had a large bleed in my GI tract from a burst varrice at the top of my stomach. I suddenly felt sick and dizzy one day and I went into the bathroom and vomited around 3/4 of a pint of blood all over the walls and the sink and it was absolutly horrifying.  I had the most surreal experience when I genuinely believed that I was going to die. With the amount of blood that came out and the mess everywhere I was convinced that there was nothing at all I could do. At that moment I had the most amazing realisation that I wasn't scared of dying. I certainly didn't want to but I knew that at the time the situation  was so hopeless there was little for me to do and I thought I would be scared and apprehensive but actually I was just calm and accepting.   Thankfully the stars aligned and everything got sorted out and I am all good but the thing that stuck with me and still helps me put my life into perspective was that moment when I first thought. Oh dear... this is it..."

"So you actually think there are surgeons who kill 1/5 children they perform knee surgery on ? AND casually announce beforehand that they do so ?  20% death rate is absolutely insane. It’s more than organ transplants, or complicated cancer removals, or brain aneurism surgeries. Way, way more. OP’s surgery is ridiculously safer than that. Less than 1% for sure, probably less than 0,1%. Actually I’d bet there’s probably no mortality data because it’s very probable that no child has ever died from such a surgery.   I guarantee you these odds are either completely misunderstood, or fabricated for the drama."

"Oh hey! I have some outlook here that may be unique for you. I have MHE as well, pretty severely, and actually have had both of the procedures you are about to go through. Currently 36.  I wouldn't worry about survival, you'll be fine there. I will say though that you are currently in the hard period, for MHE. The growth spurts that you are going through in late puberty cause a massive percentage of... basically all the problems you are going to have, ultimately.  There will still be some new growths as well from the time period of 15-19, but nothing like what you've had to deal with in the last three years. I understand having a grim outlook at your age, I did as well, but really the storm of new tumors is going to radically lessen soon, and it will become much easier to adapt without a body everchanging and finding new ways to be an asshole.  For most of us thereafter, the growths stop around 19. For me personally they have continued, I get a new one every couple years, but it's definitely manageable.  One thing I am wondering about though is why are they removing your ribs? I had partial excision of two ribs, and a major growth removed from a third, due to them being on the verge of puncturing lungs. And ribs grow back. Removing them entirely and replacing them with a metal sounds unnecessarily invasive and risky.  I'm self employed and generally have been able to live a life where the condition causes me problems, sure, but doesn't really stop me from doing anything. Totally down to be available if you have questions. Getting ribs removed was definitely one of my harder surgeries, so I wish you all the best on the recovery, and understand feeling pretty anxious right now. The hours of waiting before a surgery are always the worst."

"There is only ONE way into Heaven: Jesus Christ.  John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.   I private messaged you, but I’ll post that message here, too.   We are all sinners (Romans 3:23). Every person has lied, every person has stolen, every person has lusted after another (adultery). There are more, but the point is that we have all earned the wages of sin: death (Romans 6:23). For God to be Perfect and Just your sin must be punished. Whether that punishment is eternity in Hell is up to you and a simple choice you make. God loves you so much that He gave you Jesus. Jesus lived a perfect life and sacrificed Himself for you. He suffered and died on the cross to pay for your sins (Romans 5:8). The only thing you have to do is repent (turn from your sin with a sorrowful spirit) and put your faith in Jesus. Believe that Jesus, the Son of God, suffered and died on the cross for your sins and provided a way, the ONLY way, to Heaven and you WILL be saved (Romans 10:9-10). That is a promise from an all powerful, all loving God. Please accept Jesus. You say you do not fear death, but I know that isn’t true, everybody has a fear of death in them, it is God given. Ray Comfort from Living Waters puts it this way: if you are standing on the edge of a plane thousands of feet up without a parachute, fear will push you to put on a parachute. Fear isn’t always a bad thing. You should fear death (without the surety of going to Heaven), you should fear an eternity in Hell. That fear should push you to your salvation through Jesus. I truly hope you will consider the destination of your precious soul. I love you and would hate to know you died without knowing Jesus. I’ll be praying for you, for your salvation, and for the success of your surgery."

Being okay with dying doesn't mean you're suicidal. Look at the 5 stages of death. The last is acceptance. You've simply accepted the possibility and are brave/bold enough to take the risk where most would rather stay safe rather than take the risk to live. Big ball energy.
please don’t die.. :(
You are very strong person op.
"Living is about chasing goals, not about reaching them. Stay focused on your current goals as if the surgery is guaranteed to be successful. If it's unsuccessful you would have lost nothing and would have got to experience life in its truest essence for the last time. People usually mistake living for experiencing but experience is just a byproduct of living. Living is about the struggle to survive and the struggle to thrive. Experiencing is our perception of life. You don't need to reach abstract accomplishments, or see random sights to feel fulfilled. You can experience a full life in a single moment of struggle. There's no need to fear death, but there is a need to appreciate life. We appreciate life by trying to best to survive and thrive, and through our attempts we get to experience life through ourselves."

Been there man. Not the same things but when I was 17 I had a tumor in my head that was operable but the chance of major infection was so high it was almost certain.   My surgeon did a pretty drastic alternative surgery that was far more complicated but less infection rate which for a time became the new standard.   Nearly dying ended up being a big factor in a lot of the decisions I made as a late teen and young adult. Good luck. Life moves forward.
Praying for you ❤️  Hope you make it out ok and hopefully it works!!

"I was born with a Cleft Palate, Pier's Robinson Syndrome, Goldsburg disease, POTS, and a severe heart arrhythmia. Life sucked for me growing up in the hospital. I took speech classes til 10th grade and only stopped because of embarrassment. When I was nine I had a major surgery where they had to remove all my teeth. By ten years old, I was already a walking embarrassment that made people feel awkward just with his presence. When I would talk, People couldn't understand me which caused great strife in my everyday life. To top that off I was born with no rooftop and a good portion of my mouth missing. It made me into a great spectacle and sideways glances was my everyday life from anyone around me. John Hopkins Hospital took me in and fixed my Cleft Palate from a skin graft and a few other minor surgeries. I hated life and at the time, I couldn't give a single fuck to live. Nobody was going through what I went through so fuck them for telling me to cheer up or to ""look at the bright side"". I was a walking, barely talking, human deformity. My surgery had a 25% of failure rate and 10% death rate. Sadly at the time, (so I thought), I survived. I carried that hate/suicidal tendencies til I was about 24. Then I met Leilani ❤️. I'm trying to hold back tears as I write this, but you really never know until you try in life what joys living life can be. Meeting one person has changed me so drastically that I'm embarrassed at how benign I made my life unnecessarily. I too live life in constant pain from birth defects. Since age 14 they have had me on painkillers. I quit taking them all the time when I was 20 but I keep a script incase I have a really bad flair up. I know everyone doesn't have life on hard mode like us, but we are warriors because of our defects. Be strong and DM if you ever need someone to talk to that can relate! ❤️    Sorry for ranting and all the errors, I just want to really encourage you and let you know I feel for you so strongly!"

We’ll be waiting for your replies after the surgery. Talk to you then
So there is a 20% chance of death but in almost every single procedure or even condition that has a recorded “death rate” the percentages are extremely off.  Modern technology has significantly improved and continues to extremely quickly every year. Surgeons are becoming more and more advanced and have many more systems to work with now. That “20%” could for all we know be a 1% or even less. You’ve got this friend and update us when you get out. I’m so ready for you to be able to walk again! Nothing but improvement from here!

Good luck you are an inspiration!
Never figured I'd be told some % of the likelihood if i was going to die. Also never figured I'd go to work one day and wake up almost a week later in the ICU for some very nice doctors explaining to me some very poor odds. I feel for you. Hang in there. The human spirit deserves so much more credit than given. I don't believe in prayers or sending luck over a text but friend. You've got all of mine for whatever that's worth. Don't count yourself out. You've got it. Just keep moving forward always
Good luck OP 💕!!

"Either way this ends, I respect your stance and I truly hope you pull through it all"
"Mental fortitude is an important factor in healing. When there’s a will to survive, the body will do all it takes to stay alive.  With that being said, I am not going to be the one on the operating table. I know it’s scary. Surround yourself with the people you love, and do the things that’ll reward you with mental clarity and strength. You will be okay, tell yourself that."
"best of luck op 🤍 hope you get the best outcome, whatever that may be"
Best wishes you nat20 your saving throws
Nothing about this is fair. But you seem to be handling it about as best as could be expected.   All the best for the surgery. Here's hoping the D5 doesn't roll a Nat 1.
You are just being real fear adds nothing .  Best wishes
Best of luck.
"🥲💔🙏🏼✝️🙏🏼 I hope you don’t mind if I pray a Divine Mercy Chaplet for you. Ask all the guardian angels of those working on you in the surgery room to guide their hands and help them, as well as your guardian angel 👼    A very good prayer for healing https://holyfamilyparishssm.ca/news/the-most-powerful-healing-prayer-by-st-padre-pio"
At least im not the only one seeing through this bullshit. Sad 40k actual morons fell for it though  Make that 80k morons. Man reddit is full of stupidity.
"I don't think you're wrong. You've dealt with what life gave you. But, I beleive you should fight. Everything ends with death. No more chances to experience things. You may get the opportunity to do something you'd never dream of. Don't deprive yourself of that without having the will to fight. I won't pretend to understand your pain, because I don't. Selfishly, I just hope you find the will to live. I feel like we all deserve that much."
Um yes we are taught to do so.
I was where you are 5 years ago. Albeit with a different problem but serious none the less. I made it through and I'm pulling for you. Hugs internet stranger (gentle ones if you want them)!

Good luck

"[Metal bones!](https://youtu.be/VEKPF6KDkJ0)  On the plus side, you're going to be on the greatest pain meds humanity has been able to put together for a while after the surgery, so even if the surgery isn't a complete success, you'll have at least a few days of non-agony. And loopiness.   Maybe don't post here while loopy. Or do."

You got this sounds like your a very tough person I wish u nothing but the best
I think your outlook is completely normal. Hope the surgery goes well
"I'm not religious but I've noticed I'm also spiritual like this. And it's a very comforting thing to think.. if its meant to be, I'll survive and if it isn't meant to be, I won't.   Good luck"
We're all rooting for you. You've got this! 💖
Kick ass and take names kid. We’re all rooting for you for an awesome recovery. And you might think it’s in fate’s hands but I would argue it’s in God’s hands and he’s looking out for you
"Children shouldn't have to bear such a harsh burden, I pray this will all be behind you soon and your quality of life improves dramatically."
"Friend, I’m sorry you are going through this. Percentages in medicine have a slightly different impact on terms of how things work out in the end and there are a lot of individual factors that weigh in.   My son only had a 70 percent survival rate after being diagnosed with a pretty rare, aggressive cancer and is currently thriving and in remission after 1.5 years. There is hope, it may seem like a house of cards, but it is still hope."
Good luck!
"Did you know that Prince (the world famous artist) used to walk doors as a Jehova Witness?  Also I admire your strength, wish you the best."
I think every man should look forward to his death without wishing for it to come. Good luck kid.
It’s not that you’re suicidal. You are just not fearful of death which is brave and sooo gd damn empowering man. I will pray really hard for you right now that this goes through and you can not only walk again but you’ll run a marathon!
"Live! If just to hate Putin, it'll be worth it! Your gonna be fine kid you came to the conclusion that we all die. now do something good , you know pain try to take it away from others and you'll ease your own.  I'm pulling for ya man."
"Whatever happens, fight like fuck man. Hope everything goes well for you 💪💪"
I hope you survive.
As a nurse practitioner I can attest that death can sometimes be more preferable situation than living in chronic debilitating pain. No one should have a say in how you feel about your experience with such a terrible disease as it is unique to you. Wish you well and an outcome that allows you a better quality of life.
"I hope you understand that your friends probably weren’t being judgmental or anything negative, they just don’t know how to cope or support you in this difficult time. I hope luck is on your side today and everything goes well. Have a nice day♥️"
Let us know how it goes! I wish you the best!
"Having survived a lot of shit in my life, I fully know where you're at.  I am there, too.   Yes, the odds are always better than what they quote but being prepared is always what I do and what I tell others to do.   We never know til we're there.  In two hours, I will chant for your success and the outcome that brings YOU the most joy.     You DO have a choice so I'll hold space for you to be heard.     See ya later when/wherever that may be!  ❤️"
Good luck I’m praying for you
You a dawg buddy stay strong. I went through something very similar and it’s just normal to feel that way. God bless man
Love to you!

"Oh OP. You amazing human. I see this was posted 5 hours ago from when I’m commenting, so your surgery is rapidly approaching. I SO hope you pull through this for the better on the other side.   There is no “right” or “wrong” way to process possible death. It’s each person’s very personal situation, and however one processes it is the true right way.   I really hope you don’t die though.

"You're my age. I don't know what else to comment, I don't want to give you sympathy that'll seem patronising. There are a lot of comments anyway, so this'll probably get lost so it won't matter what I say. I'm trying to think of something good to say to you but I can't, I just have a strange urge to tell you about my pets frogs. I'm a bit strange, so that makes sense. I really, genuinely hope you are okay (I know people who say genuinely aren't generally genuine, but I felt like the word needed adding)"

For you to accept it is a good thing, however what he probably means is that he doesn't want you to give up on life either. You can still accept death, but fight for life.

"MHE team unite! I have it pretty severely as well, at the age of 36, and yeah, the way that I explain it to other people is that pain just doesn't affect me like it does other people. Not that it's like, pleasant, but at a certain point when you have always been in pain since ever, it stops being so alarming and attention grabbing, and most times falls away into a background hum.      Though one point I want to make, maybe unsolicited advice, but if you guys haven't tried an anti inflammatory diet yet... holy gods, it actually really helps! I put it off for years and then finally gave it a shot because my partner was trying it for her own reasons, and my god damn, life changing. The reduction of pain is pretty good, but moreover, the reduction in overall stiffness and arthritis symptoms is absolutely massive. I can walk up stairs on cold days now and not have it like... suck."

"I have Diffused PVNS (Pigmented villonodular synovitis) and it's pretty similar to your case. I grow benign tumors in the synovial sack of my knee that comes back 50% of the time (after surgery) for the rest of my life. I have had 5 knee surgeries since it happened 7 years ago. The first one was a full synovectomy (removal of the synovial sack around my knee + tumors). I've been in constant pain for 7 years now since they started and it's hard to walk/sleep even after all the surgeries.  I know you'll be fine and I hope the best for you dude. I too was calm before surgery and accepted death if I accidentally bled out on the table (it was supposed to be a 4 hour surgery that took 9 hours). Its funny ya know, after this horrible ordeal I've been through and I'm sure you're going through it too; It has gave me a better outlook on life. I will probably loose my leg in time but that wont stop me from moving foward."

"Living with pain, most do not understand.  How it affects you . Mental, physical, your thoughts, etc.   How all you come to crave is an end to the pain.  Death is nothing to fear, nor something to rush towards.  It is merely another adventure (at least for me).  Everything that happens is a lesson.  The “trick” is to find, understand, and use that lesson.  My hope for you is for all to be in a good way."

"Good luck OP! You are my hero, they found a tumor in me today and i am twice your age. You are dealing with much more then me and are so incredibly  strong/braver. I believe in you! You will come out the otherside."
It’s not wrong for you to be okay with dying if it means peace for you. And honestly I’d rather you be okay with dying than terrified because that’s a lot easier to console. And less stress for everyone. I hope your surgery goes great and makes your life easier. And I also hope you do get to live a long life without suffering.

"Going under general anesthesia feels like the reset button has been hit.  In that moment, it makes no difference whether we cross over to death or wake up in a few hours.  I remember having an odd smile on my face when they wheeled me into the OR before my procedure, just kind of curious.  And I'm someone who is terrified of death.  Then you start to think about how we surrender to a ""slice of death"" when we go to sleep.  We experience it by degrees all of our lives.  Having to press the reset button at all, with anesthesia sucks, but I hope when you reboot, you are capable of living a better life."
"Like, can only go up. And, I say this as a clinically suicidal person, you're definitely not suicidal for just being fine with dying. I admire that, tbh; I'm 22 and terrified I might slip up one day. It's incredibly mature of you, to have that mindset.  Godspeed, OP."
"Godspeed, you will live through this!"
Keep fighting it. Eventually you will win.  Best of luck.
"You are energy.  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed … only change form. Either way you’re good and if you do change form , I’m jealous and hope you give me a sign brother. My dog and I will be listening and watching out for ya - you’re going to be absolutely fine."

"Fuck what ever your ""friends"" say. You feel how you want to feel. And I feel the same way. It's fate. That's reality. If I knew I had a chance to die then that's the facts, jack. It is not a suicidal thought, it's simply reality. I would go so far as to say I'm not afraid of death itself (everybody dies, we're all in this together) but more so the pain associated with death.  Either way, soldier on and stay strong  edit: Seriously though, wishing you the best, keep us updated we're here for you"

"It's totally ok to accept death or even welcome it maybe. At least in my opinion. This week I had a minor hart pain and couldn't breathe or move. And I was like huh maybe this is the end, that's how I die. Well at least I am getting rid of this world. Also the world gets rids of me. Win win. But I was okey after 5 minutes. Also I was almost downing in one cup of water when I was watching a funny video. Cought the hell out of myself. Mom freaked out but I said I am okay. And I was still alive. Mission failed, please try again later. As long as its painless I am okay with dying. Good luck with the RNG. Hope things get better fo you. Because its still early for you. You still have emotions to feels. Friends to make. Memories to remember. Places to go. Maybe another day. Later. Not today."

"Idk beating the odds could mean whatever you’re betting against happening doesn’t happen. It doesn’t have to be an unfavorable split.   Also, a 20% chance of death is nothing to scoff at. If you look at an actuarial death table, people don’t hit a yearly 20% chance of dying until age 93. And this 20% chance of death is for a procedure that will take maybe a few days + however long recovery is after.   Not sure what the risk of death from covid is for people over age 65+, but I don’t think it breaks 10%."

There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and accepting real possibilities in a serious situation.  This is a form of adult self-control that is appropriate when evaluating an involved invasive treatment for a difficult invasive condition.  I don't know how that decision can be made well without some measure of reflection on and acceptance of the possible outcomes.     Here's to waking up with a less painful future!

Godspeed
You still alive?
"Tell us if you make it, good luck"
You're a tough kid and I'm sure it'll all work out.
Wishing you the best!
I’ll speak to you tomorrow my friend. Speak soon.
I'm hoping for the best for you. Even if you don't make it I'm certain your energy will live on in some way.  We are all made of the stuff of stars and we are all eternal because of that
See you on the other side   One way or the other
You got this 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 sending prayers and I hope you have a speedy recovery. Let us know when you’re done with the surgery.
"look kid, show your friends that well known picture of a child's skull with bone cancer. Point out what that does to bone. Then ask them if they'd feel different after enduring what you have or even what you may continue to. I dont doubt you are not suicidal, but people dont seem to understand what constant pain does to a person's opinion on things. I hope the best for your surgery, either way ♥"
You’re gonna get through this
"You're a strong mf. Stay that way after the surgery and comment so we all know it went OK, Wishing the best for you no matter what happens, But I hope the best of scenarios happens."
"That’s very brave I’m 14 too but a female I don’t think I could do that at all I think I would rather die than go through that and I cant say I know what your going through obviously I don’t but I hope that you’ll make it, I’ll be routing for you"
"Inspiring to end, if not longer. I can't wait to hear from you on the other side, no matter what side that is sir. *salutes"
Fuck this disease kick it’s ass you got this op.
You got too many upvotes to die.  Science facts.
If all drugs were legal and accessible would you want to live?

"Be well, friend. You are clearly a badass to survive already what you have. This surgery will be a cake-walk compared to what you've been through. Let's effing go!!!"
"Need to hear your best joke, so you have to make it!"
"I think that's a very healthy perspective to have. It's neither optimistic nor pessimistic, completely subjective. I wish you all the luck in the surgeries and hope your mobility increases and pain decreases."
Godspeed OP
"I wish you all the best.   Regardless of the outcome, I hope you find peace and comfort.   I will likely never know anything remotely close to the discomfort you feel, and hearing your situation, combined with your positive outlook, is an inspiration to myself and potentially those who feel that life isn't going their way.   Thank you for sharing."
Goodluck man I’ll think about you all day! Come back to tell us when you’re done!
"Godspeed, you will make it!"
It's not wrong to be ok with dying if you feel your quality of life isn't where you want it to be.

"A doctor shouldn't be there to sugar coat, a doctor should stick with the facts and tell you at face value what to expect. Also a 20% risk of mortality surgery sounds nigh impossible for what OP said anyways. Unless OP has a slew of other health conditions or medications they are on (which would all be taken into account before even considering something at that much of a risk), the ""estimate"" from the OP is bullshit."
"Stay strong OP, dont forget to reply to us when the surgery is successful and done!"
I salute you Captain Andrew
"&gt;	And if I die, well, I suppose then there is no more pain. My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I’m not suicidal, I wouldn’t kill myself if I had the chance. But I don’t exactly care if I die at this point. It’s in fate’s hands at this point.    What’s funny is that this is actually the most wise, mature, and healthy position for you to take. You are sagacious beyond your years. I assume your friends are all also teenagers- do not listen to them, they quite literally don’t have enough life experience to pass judgment on you or the situation you’re in. You arrived at this mindset due to your circumstances, their circumstances are so far different than yours that they’re clearly having trouble rationalizing it.   If you read this post surgery,  Mazel tov. If you can’t read this cause you’re dead, at least you’re resting"

"I remember a nurse got kind of annoyed with me when I wasn't acting nervous enough for her (I guess?) before a big surgery.  She thought I was just trying to play it cool or something, Idk, but I honestly kinda had the same attitude as you OP.  I finally got her to ease up by saying that I wasn't afraid of dying on the table because I wouldn't be around to be upset about it if I did, and besides, she wasn't going to let that happen was she?  In the end, I think she was more nervous than I was.  Regardless, I lived.  You will too.  20% chance of death also means 80% chance of life."
"5 hours in, hope it goes well for you"
"Nailed it. I was just “searching” for the term in the noggin. But that is it on the head of a nail if I ever seen one.   One day we’ll all be dead, and they call sleep the cousin of death for a reason. I’d like to think that when we die, since we can’t be aware of non existence after we die. I’d like to think it’s like going to sleep, like a blink..who knows.  We may have a chance at another life in another time, we might not. Hell we might be like the eternals and go back to some soul forge to have our memories wiped out before being sent back to earth, we may not and may just be a decomposing set of bio organic materials rotting and being recycled into simpler substances once were buried, or, turned to ash if you prefer cremation.    In any case, I feel like to live a full life, like OP, you have to accept your mortality. And I feel like that’s not something we do readily, I haven’t accepted it. Fuck if I died tommorow I’d come back as a ghost LOL! (Just some goofy humor) but really.  Death scares the shit out of me. I think that once we accept that one day, we’ll die, one day, we will cease to exist in the way we know and have been familiar with. Life becomes better- in accepting death I think you have to accept that life isn’t serious, everything is temporary, nothing lasts forever, and we’ll all be forgotten in some sense thousands of years from now. Studied as ancient history or referred too briefly as a group belonging to a bygone civilization like the Roman’s.   I mean, do you know the names of your family members 6-7 generations back? Hell I don’t even know past the 3rd generation.   But point in saying that. Is that, does all the stupid shit that we put so much emotional currency in, that we worry about, the opinions we care too much about, The negativity of someone experienced in a moment, a presentation, hanging onto embarrassing moments we don’t need to hang onto anymore…  That’s the kind of stuff I think radical acceptance frees you from and I want to be free."

"Brave as fuck for a 14 year old man. Something I've learned in my 30 years on this planet. Once you're not afraid to die, life really begins. Make another 30 years man. You're already enlightened more than most adults. Death makes life clear."
"I just want to tell you that God sees you, knows your pain, and genuinely cares about you. He sent his only son so that you might have everlasting life. You believe and trust in a lot of medical science, that they can help you - put a little of that faith in the idea that our creator is there. You don't have to know it all, understand it all, or even believe it all. You just have to trust that Jesus can take your sin and make you right with God. God bless you, you're so young and so brave to have come this far. Redeem what may be a short life for an eternal joy with our God."
"I tried to think what I might like to hear if I was about to die. And it's a terrible groan joke - so here is my favorite terrible joke for you:   Two neutrons walk into a bar. One says ""oh no! I think I lost an electron!"" The other says ""are you sure?"". And the first responds ""I'm positive!"".   I hope we see you post again OP"

"As someone with a physical therapy background, please see a physical therapist. It obviously won't help with the whole developing tumors part, but it should make life a little less pain free, and following a surgery, it should be covered by insurance or Medicare."

"20% seems high, doctors are usually very conservative when it comes to outcomes. Because of their liability and preserving life over QOL it seems like they would not opt to do the surgery with that incredibly high chance of death. For reference 1% chance of death is considered a very serious disease and quite fatal. They don't look at the 99% that live they are worried about the 1% that die. 20% seems like such an enormous risk I can't imagine a doctor willing to take on that risk even if it's exaggerated (if they give you a 20% chance of dying and you die people won't really question it, if if they give you a 1% chance of dying and you die they will get a lot of questions)."

You seem pretty emotionally intelligent, and quite brave.   If there is one last thing I'd say, you're doing very well. It is ok to be not afraid, just as much as it is ok to be terrified.

Hey man make a second post once your out of surgery.
Nothing wrong with being okay with dying. Life is hell for you sounds like. You sounds level headed even though you’re not in a great place physically.  It’s a shame we can’t talk more openly about the subject of death. Suicides could be prevented if there wasn’t such a stigma around the topic. I often say coming and going is all part of the plan.  Wishing you relief and well deserved comfort.

"There’s nothing wrong with your thought processes regarding death. You’ve been living with chronic pain for a while and supposedly in and out of the hospital. I can understand the mental stress and emotional toll that takes on a person especially during your developmental years. From a nursing student perspective, it’s good that you have a clear mindset about the possible outcomes, and can find some peace with the more morbid ones.  Take what your friends say with a grain of salt, they are not dealing with the difficulties you are. They are in their own timelines with their own decisions to make.  I do wish for you to have a successful surgery, and to have a long and healthy life and a quick recovery. Go out and do great things ❤️"

"Jesus Christ loves you. If you pass away, and you don't have at least the start of a relationship with Him, you will end up counting down from 100 to immediately waking up more alive than you've ever been--in Hell. But if you give your life over to Him now, and you tragically pass away from the surgery, you will immediately wake up in Heaven, to the most amazing, permanent environment that you could never imagine on this earth.   I get that this is an unpopular opinion, and that you probably don't want to think about this.    But it is the most important decision you could ever make.  Our lives here-even if we live to 100 yrs old-are like a grain of sand vs an entire desert when you compare our short existence on earth to eternity.   Please do not take this lightly.  Jesus loves you but He will never force you to choose Him against your will. He will let you willingly walk into hell instead of heaven in respect of your free will.  God is all that is good, and He is the source of all light; and so if you refuse to be with Him, when you die you have to go to the only place in existence that He isn't--Hell. It's also known as eternal darkness.  *You do not have to go there.*   Choose God's Son Jesus Christ today and ask Him to forgive you of your sins, of not choosing Him before now, and if you are sincere, He will save your soul.  *Please.* ❤️"

"Don't look at it as a 20% chance to die, but 80% to live.   That said, there's nothing wrong with acceptance.   My mom died a few years ago from cancer. At her initial surgery they were able to get most of the brain tumor removed, but not enough. Gave her 2 years. She made it 4, then passed.   When I told her she had 2, she just smiled and asked to see her granddaughter, my niece who she was seeing for the first time.   She never fretted or worried and was strong to the end. Though I'm still in a world of pain from losing her, seeing her stay positive with life while accepting that she was almost definitely going to die soon and being ok with that makes me so proud.   I hope to see another post from you when you recover, but if I don't then be at peace."
"Until Valhalla, Brother. Hope to see your update soon."
Good luck and godspeed Captain Andrew.
You do not know me from Adam. You know nothing about me. You are upset because I corrected you calling chiari malformation a tumor. There is a reason it is called malformation and not chiari tumor. I am not presuming I am speaking for all in healthcare. I do not find myself superior to anyone I was just correcting your mistake. It isn’t a tumor. I was just stating a fact.

"I've been in a 5-level pain for over 1 year. I'm also 14 and I'm turning 15 in a month. It does something to your head, I'm not suicidal, but I don't care whether I die or not. On 1 side I get no more pain, and on the other I deal with more of it. I've been in 3 life or death situations so far, and you know how people say you have a fight or flight response? I just choose or.  Anyway dealing with that pain at that age isn't normal. Your brain is still developing and it isn't good to develop around that pain. No it's not normal to feel that way, but remember, it isn't your fault. You have the right to feel that way, and I understand. Good luck, I hope you come out okay."
"I'm sorry to hear and I can emphasize with being really sick and young. I have my fair share of conditions gout, crohns, almost diabetic, and today they called because they found a black mass in my lungs. I'm 26 and I know that's not as young as you, and I'm definitely not trying to compare. I'm saying I understand the not being scared part. Today I was being warned i could be 6 feet under if I don't change, yet I don't fear death. My mom asked why that doesn't scare me and it's a hard thing to explain. I hope everything goes well my grandfather has a similar issue and I'm aware of how painful it can be. Keep positive and I'd love to hear back from you sometime."
"So sorry to hear this. I’m glad you’re at peace, and I really hope that the surgery goes well."
Age is so important. I got hit by a truck at 16 and survived. It was all about my age and the same will go for you.

"He never stated that the doctor was the one who told him; he could have looked it up. And the physician or surgeon involved might not have taken the time to determine the difference between his odds and any other patients, because they often don’t. If the doctor didn’t expressly sit this patient down and explain how their odds relate to other people who have undergone similar procedures, specifically to discuss how this patient is different than the typical, then they most likely didn’t. It’s common, with the express purpose of preventing the patient from panicking themselves by googling their procedure. So who knows.   Although, I’d point out that you saw a comment where I try to let a child know that they are less likely to die than they assumed, and your response is to…. try and make them feel worse? Try to demean me? I’m not sure what’s wrong with you, but I couldn’t imagine behaving this way. Whether you’ve got some form of inferiority complex about me and my career, or you’re just a hateful person, I’m not sure. I sincerely hope that you find whatever help you need to be a better person.

"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying.  That's not true. Life is amazing but it's also terrible. I love my life but that's a privilege, not a right. No one has any right to tell you how how you're allowed to feel about life. Least of all someone who's never been in your shoes."
I've gone through 5 hand surgeries for a double fracture and limb lenghtening and I'll go through the next one maybe in 2 weeks to remove a metallic rod. It all went good and it will be better for you and for me from now. I promise. My thoughts are with you and I wish you to be strong and to think about something or someone who motivates you to go forward in life. Much health my brother!
YOU GOT THIS DUDE! GOOD LUCK :)

Prayers for you &amp; praying that you’re saved! God’s has his arms around you if you are♥️
Praying 4 you. Really waiting for the update. Plz be okay Kid. God's gotcha. Sending love through the binary to you.
It's not weird to not fear death. I don't. I do fear prolonged pain and suffering. I fear being so incapacitated by it that I become fully reliant on others for everything and being a burden.
I wish you the best and hope you make it and live a full and wonderful life with your pain managed to a sustainable level for you as an individual.
"Man, for 14 years old, you seem to be more intelligent and articulate than some 20 something's.  As far as your friends saying its not cool for you to be okay with dying... Well its not something young teens are faced with much, if at all. They are saying that because coming to the idea of your friend, or really close friend not being here anymore is confusing and brings about lots of emotions and questions that are difficult to sort through.  In a good selfish way, its because they want you to stay. In a not so good selfish way, its because they dont experience the physical pain that you endure every second of the day, for something such as pain, something that you cant necessarily ""see"", they cant even fathom what you must battle daily, even getting clothes on, or using the bathroom.   You are brave dude. Youve got support from tons of strangers here that im sure are willing to be an ear to vent anything to and a shoulder to just lean on at any time.   Xo"

"I also have MHE and when I was 15, I too had to have a rib removed due to a growth the size of a softball.  While it can present challenges managing MHE, it is possible to live in relative comfort over the course of your life. Sometimes that does require the occasional operation, but just stay positive.  When I had my most major operation at 15 (which was over 20 years ago by the way), I received great follow up care despite some complications. Medical science has advanced considerably since then.  Just take my advice on one thing and dont be stubborn like I was - listen to the doctors who tell you what physical activities you should avoid for the next few years. I promise you that it will get better and that after some time has passed, you will be back to 100% with better quality of life.   P.S. grabbing the back of your knee and using your leg is a great way to get yourself up during recovery without much pain"

"In the days I lived in the jungle. In a house hidden away from the world. I had some strange visitors trekking through the jungle stop by. Lou was nothing like you would imagine a massive musical talent to be like. And tony was exactly what you would expect from a middling 80’s tv star. I offered them water and Lou politely refused while Tony turned his nose up. The biggest mystery was not why they were there. But how this unlikely duo came to be. As I endeavored to unwind there tail an unnatural mist filled the forest floor with foreboding and dread. We nervously huddle to together and sang Mambo number 5. The sharp edge of the fear was still there, but blunted just enough to keep our sanity. Minutes crept by… a little bit of Monica in my life, and turned to hours… jump up and down move it all around. We woke the next day. Stacked like fire wood. None had a memory of sleeping. Only the shafts of sun light beaming through the forest canopy removed the weight of an unknown fear still pressing down. I don’t know how Lou kept it up. But I have now doubt he saved our lives. I left the only home I’d know for years that morning. With a glance back. And when I feel the fear creep back in… A little bit of Sandra in the sun. Thank you Lou. Thank you forever."
Well done for being so brave! I hope the future brings you good fortune

If you're bored or want someone to talk to, just dm me or reply to this comment.    I 100% understand your position. I don't think you are wrong to be ok with death.

"It's not wrong to be okay with dying, it's ideal. Everyone dies, and you can die at basically any moment from a million different things. Being okay with it is a long way from actively seeking it, and it's far better to accept your fate and go peacefully than to die afraid and unprepared. I never saw much reason to fear death anyway.   Either things improve or stay the same, or you go out with less pain than most. Whatever the destination, I hope the journey treats you well"
"The first thing I’ll say is that the probability of your death is based off a large sample size of people with varying degrees of severity, other problems and age. Therefore, you aren’t necessarily inclined to the survivability of that average.   The second thing I’ll say is that medicine and medical technology are advancing rather rapidly, and, without unnecessarily nerding out, if all goes well with your surgery and you can tough out another 10-20 years, I’m sure you’ll be able to take some form of medicine (whether that be a direct treatment/cure for this, or something else that indirectly treats/cures this) that allows you to live a long, pain-free life."

"I have MHE too and have had 28 surgeries. Each surgery is scary and unique in their own way. And it is hard hearing all of the risks involved with surgery.  It has helped me to be in touch with other people with MHE too. We have a website called mhecoalition.org as well as several Facebook groups. If you would ever like someone to talk to, I'm here. Your emotions are so valid and dealing with the pain and the struggle each and every day can be so exhausting on your own."

Hey man how are ya now
"I live with chronic migraine with a pain of 6-10 every day. I started getting them when I was 2. I know this because it’s the first memory I have. I once had a migraine that lasted 4 years with an average pain of 8 out of 10. I’m not suicidal, but in the past I’ve prayed to die and the rest of the time I didn’t care whether or not I did die, because at least that would be an end to the pain. I would never ever wish this pain on even my worst enemy, so I understand not “your” pain exactly, but exactly what you mean. I truly hope this works for you. I don’t know you, but I wish for you much less pain and for you to walk out of that hospital. Good luck. 🙂🙂"

"I also have MHE. So does my dad and his dad, along with one of my uncles and his son. My 12yo son just had his first surgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN last month. He had 4 areas on one leg operated on to remove the osteochondromas.   My dad had one turn malignant and lost his right scapula in the early '90s. If you didn't know that, you couldn't tell by meeting him. He's had over a dozen operations at this point. The advancements made since from his first operation in the '60s to my son's surgery in February are absolutely astonishing. I can't believe that my son is walking without a limp 3 weeks after having his ankle, knee and thigh operated on. I hope you make it through and your recovery is faster than expected!"

The doctor came in in recovery and said that he didn't think it worked. But I got better!!! At the 2 week check up the doctor walked in and said ""I rarely have had to do this in my career, but Mrs ___  I was wrong. Your tests came back clear. The surgery was a success."" At times I had to be realistic about things 💯.  But always keep the faith! You are a badass!!!"
"Well, perception and sentimentality regarding death varies greatly between people, so maybe turn off that lizard brain for a sec and try using something called empathy."
"Perhaps there is a 20 percent chance of failure, where failure does not mean death, but means that the tumor(s) could not be removed completely, or that despite removing them the patient is still in pain/dealing with the same (or worsened) symptoms? That seems believable to me."

"While I don’t doubt the validity of his post and condition at all, I was however wondering about the 20% chance of death as well.  I get ECT done three times a week and have to go under general anesthesia for it and from my understanding the chance of complications from that are very very low. Maybe he has additional health issues that we’re unaware of?"

"Pain is a very complex thing.  There is no one single “pain center” in the brain, it is processed through a variety of areas in the brain.  Pain Management as a medical specialty wouldn’t be nearly so difficult if it could be solved so easily.  Even if it could be done like that, it would likely cause more issues than it it would solve.  There are people born without the ability to feel pain, due to issues with the pain receptors throughout the body, and they usually die pretty young because pain is such an important sensation in letting you know when you are in danger of injury."

"Good luck and I completely get that.  Just wanting the pain to be over sometimes is the best thing.  I've seen many who live forever and fully functional, and others who are young and can barely move, constant pain.  The end of pain sounds awesome compared to agony.    Tell your friends to put a clothes pin on them in a few places and sit with it for a few hours. Then how it feels when it's taken off.  That's all you want.  To take off those damn pins."
"Hey, I’m 61 years old and have MHE.  I’ve had 14 surgeries, including having my scapula removed due to one growth being a chondrosarcoma.  I gave the disease to my youngest daughter, who has been operated on many times at chop.  If you would ever like to chat with someone that has the disease let me know. Although the surgery can be painful,  it is absolutely safe.  You are going to love no longer having the tumors-it feels great.  My daughter’s arms and legs were bowed—and now they are straight!  It’s normal to worry, we all do.  I knew my parents were worried.  I used to guilt my dad into buying me a steak dinner the week before surgery.  I promise the week after surgery you will think it’s the best decision you ever made. MHE is a life long disease.  It has been painful but it hasn’t defined who I am.  I have three daughters and a fabulous family.  That’s what you will do to.  Plan on living another 70 years and look forward to having a positive impact in this world.

"Everything will be alright. I never knew of this disorder until I met my wife. She has had 13 surgeries, all on the right side of her body. She had two of her ribs removed on her right side, because she twisted wrong and collapsed her lung, because of a tumor connected to the rib.   It’s a good thing that it did happen, because they found sarcoma in that tumor. Recently, she had three growths removed from her right knee by boring into the bone. She had trouble walking prior to the surgery since the tumors rubbed against tendons, but now she walks fine with that leg. Now she needs another surgery on the left knee to remove more growths, but she says she can’t handle any more surgeries."
My daughter (also 14) had 3 tumors removed from her knee. Her recovery has been quick just finished a month on crutches. Only mild pain after a week or so. I hope your procedure and recovery goes as well.

"Hey op, keep fighting the good fight. Those thoughts are not uncommon especially in circumstances like your own. I’ve been to a couple of group therapies; where some of the people who had gone through life altering surgery, or survivors of near death experiences have expressed similar thoughts about their own mortality. When you make it out of the surgery definitely talk to an adult or doctor about getting help with your thoughts. All the best bro"
Damn bro I hope you will have a great recovery
"You are very strong and wise for your age, probably because you’re living through a hard experience that you’ve managed to adapt to which is incredible.

"I've felt this same way going into every surgery I ever had, my last being brain surgery to remove a tumor on my pituitary. I've been under so many times I like to think I go to sleep in one universe and wakeup in another.  I think it's healthy to have your level of acceptance, it's easier to deal with what is happening right now then to feel apprehensive about what could be.  When you get out of surgery, if you're feeling nauseated or in pain, just take things one breath at a time and things will get better. If you're breathing, you're living. Enjoy the multiverse kid, maybe you'll have super powers with those bionic ribs."

"Everyone can decide theirselves, how they want to worry about their own upcoming death. We will all die in the end, no matter what. Being afraid is ok. Not being afraid is ok. We are all different.  My spouse for example thinks after death there will be nothing. It’s a very relaxing thought for her. For me it’s the complete opposite. I am afraid of dying. Both views are just fine. Nothing needs to be changed. As long as we appreciate each others views, we will get along well.  Your friend might be a bit narrowminded. He/she might not understand your point of view. However most likely, he/she just hopes the surgery will go well. And he/she does not want to lose you yet. That’s why he/she is most likely saying things like this. Instead of trying to guilt you, he/she probably just cares about you a lot. He/she is your friend after all.  And for me… Im just a random complete stranger from the internet… But even I care and worry about you. Hope your surgery and the recovery process goes well! And I am sorry for all the pain you have had to encounter in the past. Good luck and lets hope this surgery can fix it all!"

"A few weeks ago I went through a major back surgery. Before it, I saw a consulting surgeon, who told me a horrifying story of how a patient had died on the table from the exact surgery I was to be getting—a single small mistake, and she’d bled out on the table. It wasn’t necessarily a high-risk surgery, just a *major* surgery, which required extremely delicate vascular work. In short, they had to move my guts and many major veins out of my way to access my spine. If any of those veins had suffered even the smallest nick, it would have been catastrophic—and I could have, in fact, died. I was warned that there was a non-zero risk of death with a surgery as major as the one I was getting. There were other risks, too, including permanent paralysis.  Being told I could die, just like that, was very, very scary. Like you, I was in agony. I could no longer walk. (During the surgery, it was discovered that one of the discs in my spine—the cushions of cartilage between your vertebrae—had *disintegrated*, and pieces of it had popped out into my spinal canal, pressing on my nerves. That’s why it was so bad. We have no idea why no scan we ever did caught how horrible the disc had become.) I decided to go through with the surgery.  It’s been about two months since then. My pain has gone from a daily 5-6, 7 when it was really bad, to a 2 when it’s bad, a 1 when it’s decent, and a 0 when it’s good. A 0. I haven’t felt 0 pain since I was 11 years old, and I am now 33.  It was very, very scary. I was fortunate to have great surgeons.  You’re going to do great. You’re going to come out the other side of this, and you’re going to be amazed at how much your life can change. At least, I hope so. We don’t have the same condition, but I hope you receive immense relief. But I have faith you’re going to wake up. I’m commenting when this post is 6 hours old, so I doubt you’ll see this—you’re sitting in OR prep right now, most likely.  But I believe in you. It’s okay if you end up realizing you’re scared. I was. When they took me from my mom to the OR, I broke down crying and said “I’m scared” over and over and over and she had to hold me for a few minutes till I calmed down enough for the nurses to wheel me away. It’s okay to be accepting, too, of the possibility that you might die. Because I’ve also been there, due to other health issues. Making peace with it is also okay. However you feel is okay. You’re allowed to feel your feelings.  You’re brave as fuck, buddy, and I’m proud of you for choosing a destiny where you have a chance of *feeling better* even if it comes with risk. We deserve a chance to *feel better* and *feel human*. When you wake up, if you want someone to chat with, my DMs are always open.  God speed."
Good luck!
"All surgeries come with a risk of death, from the anesthesia if nothing else.  There can also be the risk of sepsis if the surgical site becomes infected.  Other than that, it depends largely on where in the body the surgery is taking place, if there are any major organs nearby, proximity of major blood vessels, etc."
Best of luck to you

Do you know how long the surgery is supposed to take?

"I feel so lucky. I have a similar hereditary trait called Multiple Osteochondroma. We too get bone grows, ours are random and fairly few, but they can grow long a hook shaped, causing them to literally snag on muscle tissue.  I had to get one in my thigh remove, and one in the middle of a nerve cluster under my dominant arm miraculously broke off on its own after an accident.  Terrifying to think how similar our abnormalities are, but how different they effect our lives.  I hope your surgery brings you relief and freedom. Once that damn chondroma broke in my arm, I could shoot a Bow and Arrow again. I hope you get to enjoy what you've lost too."

"I think you’re getting downvoted because you said something bad, just cause you weren’t exactly getting OP’s point. They really aren’t suicidal, they don’t want to die. They don’t care if they do but that doesn’t extend to anything more than their extreme pain. It’s not a wanting of death or even a apathetic approach to death, they just honestly are completely fine with the chance of them not being here if it means they might not feel the pain they feel. It’s just an acceptance of the odds."

"Just lost my son to cancer. He did not want to die (left wife and kids behind) but due to the pain, and his advanced planning, he was ""ready"" to go. Fight hard...he did. But when the time comes, embrace it as the pain will end (his words, not mine)."
"My friend, I'm 47 yes old and I read a lot of all kinds of things, but I've never read anything that hit a chord so deep and touched me as you just did. Very human, 100%purity is what I just read and I'm not sure where it brought me and how I feel right now because where I'm at is unfamiliar. I admire your bravery and the amounts of pain you've endured and continue to endure is honorable to me as I know from some of the things I've been dealing with since 26yrs old that make me feel very much alone, isolated and most of all unrelatable to anyone I know which causes a person to turn inward at times. Ok can tell you I broke 38bones in a bike wreck in 2001 and I was in a very ungodly amount of pain and I recovered from that. In 2016 something bad started happening to my body and 3trios to er and one to a clinic no one could diagnose me correctly. Within 9weeks I became paralyzed from under my arms down. I had an infection in my spine from a bone spur, it's called osteomyelitis, they took out almost 3"" of my spine and replaced it with more metal. I stayed in the hospital paralyzed even worse it seemed for 8 weeks. I went home and was bed ridden for 11 months with mom and step dad doing everything from feeding me to wiping my butt and I was beyond scared of having to live like that for the rest of my days. By the twelfth month I was up in a walker and today I get around pretty good although the hell that the experience put on my mental and my body seemed to age me a good deal. I don't know how it will go for you, I just know we are amazing creatures and our body's can withstand and endure more than we can comprehend and our lives no matter how bleak or difficult,  I've always been able to find a reason I was glad to wake up even on the shittiest of my days ( and some have been pure shit misery). I we want to say to you that I'm going t ok be thinking about you until I see an update in the next couple days and I will be thinking with positive energy. I also want to tell you that I love you my friend and no matter what may peace be forever with you!"

Idk I'd be pretty comforted to find out that the death rate is lower than I thought
I pray that may Allah take you into his custody and protect you during your operation then guide ur body mind and soul to salvation
"I now see the post, 7 hours after it got posted..."
It sounds like you’ve got the right attitude.  Good luck my man! I’m sure whichever direction your life goes you will handle it.
Sending all the positive energy I have. I hope whatever the outcome you find peace and relief. I understand you're sentiment and will be thinking of you and waiting for what I hope is a positive outcome.
"Just seeing this, but I sincerely hope that all went well and you are recovering."
Good luck bro❤️
"&gt;My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point. It's in fate's hands at this point.  I get this. It's not wrong. It's just looking at life realistically. All the best"

If you ever want to talk or just vent, please send me a message."
You good bro?

Acceptance of what? The fact that OP is going to come out of this happy and healthy and might be the first real life superhero?!

You're right. I apologize. I was so worked up I merely skimmed over it.

One last mission agent: don’t die
The fact he's mentioned it all in the past makes it more plausible. There's no reason he would constantly talk about it here.  Just in case it's true and he reads this.... The procedures you described don't sound particularly bad. The chance of dying is the same as anyone who goes under general anesthesia. The procedures are going to work and your life is going to improve.
"yo OP, how are you rn?"
"I hope all is going well for you, dude, All the best."

You've basically given them an ultimatum to ""believe or else"" when they're in a very vulnerable position.  OP is at peace.  They've found their peace.

"Death is a natural part of life ...  As someone who hurts everyday, has insomnia as a result, death is something I look forward to, not gonna rush it , don't care to grow old . But still have lots of life left I'd like to enjoy to the best of my ability.   And as someone with  a near death experience,  I want to die with a smile on my face , if I had died that night,  wouldn't have been so bad , I was happy, but it also ment I wouldn't have seen this much of life.    It's a double edged sword. But as you said , it either works and you can do something you used to be able to again, you no longer feel so dependent and useless . And if it doesn't work, you don't hurt or have to worry anymore .  I understand , hopefully your family does too.    People would understand easier if you're older , seen life , and hurt. It's sad when you're much younger , but again it's life . Not everyone gets dealt pocket aces and gets 2 aces on the flop or a royal flush on the river .   Sorry you have such shit on your mind, sorry you had to grow up so early."

It’s worth more to the people who truly believe than just that. So let those who need it find their way to where they wish to go and let those who don’t need or wish saving go the way they wish."

Thinking of you OP.
Dying and after death is always an interesting topic. What ive learned. Everyone dies. There may be an afterlife. There may not be. If there is well find out sooner or later. If there isnt. It doesnt matter. What a ride huh? When we sleep i think is like being dead. Just lights off. The exciting thing is waking up. But when asleep. I dont have concept of time or anything. Just out. Then i wake up. If i didnt. I dont think id know the difference. the waking is where im aware. Unless theres an afterlife. In which then itd be like waking up in some strange world to explore or be like getting off a ride or something. No idea whats after death. I hope something! But alas theres always that though of nothing being after. But then i wouldnt care id be gone. Maybe its heaven. Maybe its rebirth. Maybe its some ghostly thing. Maybe its another dimension. Maybe its nothing. Either way. Its exciting...but im in no rush to go and im enjoying it while i am here. Suffering is no fun and that peace that release from the suffering. To just fall asleep and the suffering stops is an alluring thing and i can see where it would entice people to check out early. But we could die at any given minute anyway so why not hang around until the end? See what happens. Im not implying anything or anything like that. I just enjoy the subject and discussing it with people as the possibilities are pretty infinate. Heck maybe life is the dream? Good luck. Have fun and thank you for playing!✌
Hoping for the best. Seeing this post 7 hours later and hoping you’re coming out on it with great news. Best of luck and really looking forward to an update

I had a surgery that could have killed me. I still libe with a condition that has less a chance to kill me now that ive had the surgery(airway problem). What I've learned through all this is that there is no reason to be alive than to find out what happens next. That's it life death whatever. At least I got to see what happened.
Good luck! Praying for a quick recovery

"Being young, you have your whole life ❤ ahead of you, so go into surgery with positive thoughts and I will look for your update, as your odds of making it are quite good. As for you worrying about not fearing death, it's what we are born to do. It's part of life's great cycle. Every living thing on earth experiences it. We seem to be the only ones who fear it. I am like you, I do not. When I almost lost my life drowning, but saving my son, it was him or me, I decided it was me. I had such a feeling of peace come over me, it is almost indescribable. As my son who was panicking pushed me down for the final time to get up my foot hit bottom and I was able to get both of us to shore. No blame, he was only 5 at the time, and yes, he was in a life jacket. I wasn't because we were just swimming offshore when he suddenly panicked and grabbed onto me. That feel of not fearing death has not left. Later, when I was diagnosed with a brain tumor, no fear. As a firefighter, when a burning roof collapsed on me, no fear. I think that once you overcome the fear, it does not come back. I can't be sure because I'm not going to charge someone shooting a gun or anything, but if my examples are any indication, you have nothing to fear in your future either. I hope that the surgery reduces your pain, for many years of living."

"I wish you the best of luck to a successful surgery.  I hope it really helps reduce your pain levels.  I completely understand your way of thinking, it's not wrong.  Your friends are wrong for not caring that you suffer.  Not saying this is your current situation,  I believe if we can let our furry babies go so they don't suffer, we should be allowed to let family/friends go with dignity and not let them waste away in bed and suffer. (If they agree with it)  I've told my family if anything happens, don't hold onto me out of selfishness,  let me go with dignity.    Sending you healing energy! 💛"

Why concentrate on 20% chance of death. Concentrate on 80% chance of living
"I think it is totally normal to have made your peace with the possibility of death, especially given that you experience chronic pain. I don’t think anyone who doesn’t experience chronic pain can understand that. Death is tragic but it’s also natural. We will all experience it one day, and the fact that you’ve made your peace with that at such a young age is a sign of maturity. I wish you the best whatever that may be for you and your life."

"Yeah i always think to myself was my life worth Living? And i always realize even if i never achieved anything great i still say to myself even if i experienced only pain atleast i felt something instead of nothing. my dream is to be remembered nothing more nothing less, i probably will not achieve my dream, but i was alive and i felt and i will die one day most likely, I think these thoughts everyday and it kinda makes me mad that people try to ignore things like what is the meaning of life or what is my dream, the hardest thing to accept is your and my dream will most likely never come true but the even harder thing is being happy with that. i always try to live like i will die tomorrow because i may i do not always do the best job but i will try, but the most important thing you should keep in mind not just you but everybody is fight back live, even if you do not think you will be happy you are still feeling feelings you may never feel again and i wish you good luck man i know you can do it. Sorry for the whole meaning and life rant i just think its important.    Also sorry for the bad grammer its late where i live.    Looking forward to your next post :)"

"Damn, when you find this and it’s 7 hours old…GOOD FUCKING LUCK OP  OP doc’s, you’re at work right now. Do what you do"
You’ve come to terms with your condition and life and your a brave young man. I’m sorry you have to deal with this pain and the complications that come with it. Any one of us could have died today on the highway or at work. What have you. I have faith the surgery will be successful and you’ll have more mobility and be able to walk with less pain. I wish you the best.
"I’ve had autoimmune issues including arthritis since I was 14. I’ve had multiple surgeries to help me walk. I’m now 28, walk with a cane, exist at a constant 4-6 pain scale, depending on a bunch of factors but normally I just blame the weather, and for one of the first times in my life I’m contemplating actually being ok with living. It’s hard growing up constantly thinking you are going to die soon. It’s harder when life smacks you in the head and reminds you that you are still here. It doesn’t get easier, if anything it gets harder, but in some ways it gets better. I hope you have the best outcome for you. Your suffering is valid but also not unique. There are others who can support you if you need it and if that time comes I encourage you to seek out support groups. At the end of it all though life goes on one day at a time. I hope the best for you, but we have no real power to change anything. Things will happen how they happen. And so it goes."
when you come back from surgery you'll be happpy to learn that your new nickname will be boner.
It's been 7h 👀 hope you're okay lil man
"Oh, and I forgot to say. Regardless of what the odds of survival truly are or are not with you, you are facing your mortality in probably the strongest and healthiest way you possibly can.  When you live through this, I can't wait to see how fulfilling your life will be from here on in. I'm super proud of you for facing it the way you are."
Not being afraid of death and being suicidal are two completely different things. It’s sad your friends don’t understand that but I wouldn’t really expect them to since they aren’t in your situation. You just gotta do you and be happy with your own life. Good luck kid
Wish you the best man

"You may or may not be a Christian, but just wanted to let you know I prayed/am praying for you to come out fully cured. Keep fighting brother, all things are possible for those who believe. Stay strong."
"My brother has lived with MHE for his whole life, and the pain is indeed debilitating. He's had life threatening tumors on the inside of his ribcage that were in danger of piercing lungs, severed tendons, more surgeries than I can count, and is still going strong. He's one of the most resilient and stubborn people I've ever met, and what seems to have carried him through all of this pain and uncertainty is a ""fuck you"" kind of attitude, along with lots of rest.  There's nothing wrong with a healthy acceptance of death, as long as you can still hang on to a will to live. Hoping your procedures are successful, and that you regain your mobility and are able to live a fuller life."
"&gt; My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point. It's in fate's hands at this point.  &gt; There is a 20% chance of death with all these very complicated procedures  It’s a real possibility. Making peace with what’s essentially out of your hands and having that realistic outlook shows an impressive amount of maturity at such a young age."

You got this brother. Ik you’ll walk away from this stronger then ever.
When I saw this was seven hours ago 😳
Hope you survive it bro! I hope to see you've typed an update tomorrow. God bless and God willing things go well
You're a courageous young man. I sincerely wish you well and hope you can be pain free after your operation. You have many things in life to experience. Don't give up on yourself.
!remindme 12 h
"You've got this! I can tell by your story that you have incredible strength and you are gonna pull through. My thoughts are with you mate, all the best ❤"
Good luck op
R u still alive?
You made it kid :) there is so much ahead for you. I hope this helps ease your daily pain!
"7 hours later, you ok OP?"
This person is not worried about dying. Why mention sin and Hell? Why are you trying to invoke fear instead of embracing PEACE.   Ew.
"OP, I hope you make it out of this. I 32 M also have this disease, and I know with the right attitude you have just the thing to beat this disease, ""MHE does not have ME"""
"I think it’s great you’re not afraid of dying. We all have to die one day, including your friend unfortunately. So better to accept it and not live in fear.   Btw- I recently discovered something called Death Cafes, they happen all over the world. That helped me to overcome my fear of dying."
How is it that hard to believe? Lmao.
Willpower does amazing things! Keep optimistic and know many reddit strangers will be cheering you on from miles away!   Good luck! Hold your head high and go forth.
Here we this post is 7 hours old :((
Hello?
Well yes that’s different. But it should be fairly obvious that karma-farming is the accusation.
You got this! You are allowed your own opinions and outlooks on life. You are a strong individual it's clear from your words. Good luck on the surgery and what's next to come! Sounds like a well prepared young man to me! Wiser than your age.
Hope the surgery works out for you and if it doesn't well you took the risk so you'll go down as someone courageous
🤍

"Ah man. You’re the same age as my youngest.  You sound very brave to be honest.  Good luck to you.  Even though we’ve never met, me and about sixty thousand (as I type this) other people are rooting for you."

"OP, say something. It's been 7 hours."
"Just came across your post, from 7 hours ago.    I have every confidence you'll have made it just fine thru surgery.  And personally, I think your attitude towards life and death is just fine.  Your not saying that you want to die, and at the same time you've accepted that (unfortunately) life is going to be painful.   I think it seems pretty healthy actually.  Seems to me like you have a pretty good handle on things, accepting that we do all eventually pass and at the same time accepting/adapting to your limitations and still trying to improve things for yourself.  Seems pretty responsible, mature and realistic to me.  You seem to me to as much as you can, not letting or at least adapting your situation to not let it interfere with you going on about the business of living your life.   Please let us know how things are going and I hope this surgery brings you some relief."
We all get to process death by ourselves. This is your process.
Omg it’s been 7h. I hope you are well

Hey man I am sending all of my best wishes toward you! You have a very healthy mindset and I’m hoping your surgery goes well and you have a restful recovery.
Meh you’ll make it. 20% is low  Gl
"I have this same disease. I've never heard from anyone else like this and I've been struggling with a lot of the same stuff. My back was messed up so badly for a while I couldn't even lie down in bed without being in pain. I'll admit I also thought about what would happen if this progressed further. I couldn't walk, couldn't even stand, couldn't lie down without pain. Was worried about dropping out of school, losing my job. It took PT, a brand new bed and pillows, new shoes, and constant back brace to even get back to a baseline, which was still chronic pain all the time. I thought maybe if my tumors just got cancerous enough, maybe I could just pull the plug. Living in pain constantly changes how you feel about death and that's not a bad thing. But now that I'm recovering and I can enjoy life again without constant pain, it's easier to appreciate living. But this disease is constantly here and lurking in the back of my mind.  We got this. If you've made it this far with all these bones, it takes a lot more than surgery to knock us down."

"Little dude, You are completely fearless in the face of the unknown. Very few have that courage. And you’re in it, RIGHT NOW.  No matter what happens, nothing can take that away from you.  I pray your destiny is to live to read this post, without pain."
I have cowdens syndrome. It’s similar to your condition except my tumors grow on my organs. I also have an increase in lower age of death. I’ve had one cancer scare so far. I’m 34 and have had 20 surgical procedures since I’ve been 11. Which is roughly 1-2 a year. I’m not scared of death. It’s not suicidal to say your not scared of death. Every surgery I’ve ever had I just say “well I hope I wake up”. I’ve been fed up for about the last 10 years. My kids keep me going to every surgical appt. Your feelings are valid. A chronic health condition sucks.
Can’t wait to hear back from you after the surgery. You’ve got this.

Oh my god no one cares
You are facing a truly difficult obstacle like a fucking man! You’re gonna make it out just fine and I’m sure you will learn to never live in fear of anything including death. Keep fighting brother
Godspeed
When you see the post is 7 hours old!! 😰😰😰😭😭😭
Your gonna pull through and be running like forest Gump pal!!
"So this popped up on my feed just now…right at the seven hour mark. I hope OP pulls through and really hoping we will get an update in the next day or so… And if OP sees this, your friends simply can’t understand the amount of pain you’re in constantly and how it can affect you/your position on living or dying.  They’ve likely not had to live in agony on a daily basis and can’t understand if they tried…nevermind that teenagers are by and large sociopaths and narcissists simply because they are hormonal whirlwinds (so it passes for most). Try not to hold it against them or let them make you feel like less.  Most of us reach that indifference after a lifetime of experience, trauma, pain, laughter, anger, and everything else that goes with 70+ years.  You just got fast tracked.  I hope if you do pull through, your pain is eased and you’ll be a candidate for other procedures down the road that will further the possibility for a better quality of life."
I understand your thought process. I hope it alleviates your pain.

Accepting death is probably one of the bravest things someone can do, if you do happen to pass away (which I really hope you don't) just know that you'll go to the next level. Wether that be heaven, the afterlife, or something else who knows. atleast you'll be going there strong and accepting. Its so empowering that you can look at death in the eye and not be afraid.

You’ve accepted the fact that surgery may work, but it may not, and you seem ok with that, which is what we should all be thriving for as we meet our maker, acceptance. I can’t even imagine your pain, as far as those who know you personally, they should accept whatever views you have on your outcome, this is your fight, not theirs. I am praying hard for you to live but also praying that your suffering not be prolonged.

But there is beauty and redemption often worth observing. All we can hope for is to make an impact on those close to us and maybe a larger circle by our actions.

"Your friends might think it's weird for you not to be scared if death, but they don't live in your shoes. They've had the world sugar coated and painted pretty color for them. But you on the other hand have had to learn life while dancing with pain. No one but you can know how that is and it brings a maturity to the table that at your age is not normal. Fearing death does no good for anyone or anything. Acceptance that death comes and goes for all living things, at a schedule unbeknown to us is the greatest peace you can ever find."

"As someone with health conditions, albeit less intense than yours, I understand the feeling. I feel like allot of people who tell others who are suffering that they're wrong to be fine with death don't quite understand what that individual has gone through to stay alive. How much it takes to just persist.   It takes allot of will and bravery to come to terms with death, and no one should try shame you for it. It comes for us all eventually, and people have different extents to what they're willing to put up with to prolong the inevitable.  With that being said, good luck mate. You're a tough individual, and while I know words won't change your condition, I still am sorry for the hand life has dealt you."

A knee and rib surgery have nowhere near a 20% death rate...  Getting an entire knee replaced has a .001% same day mortality rate. Most of the time...nothing to do with the knee...it's from anesthesia. Which means it wouldn't significantly raise due to rib replacement either.  Brain surgery has a 2% death rate...yall are gullible.

"I just went through tumor removal from my spine two weeks ago. It was fucking scary, and not nearly as high risk as your surgery, but I understand your fear and pain. I had the same attitude going it— it either works or it doesn’t. I won’t lie, the aftermath was excruciating, and I wasn’t prepared for it, but the one thing I learned is that (as cheesy as it sounds) a good attitude goes a long way. Finding small things to be grateful for and plastering on a smile even when I felt like I was dying was the only thing that got me through the worst days.   Godspeed and I hope everything turns out okay for you man."

I hope you come out of this surgery with a much brighter future that is filled with far less pain. If you don’t make it out of surgery, I hope to meet you on the other side. ❤️"

"What a reply. So first of all, there are orthopaedic surgeons who specialize in bone tumors, and I think they'd have a much better idea of survival statistics than someone with an inflated ego prognosticating based on essentially 0 information of the patient's condition. You're playing a guessing game of what a physician may or may not have said/may or may not know. My issue with your reply was that you're potentially overriding well-informed information given to the patient by their physician, who undoubtedly knows infinitely more about this condition and its clinical course than you do. You'll also notice I replied to you and not the kid, who I have nothing but the utmost empathy for. So no, I didn't take anything out on a child. Also... Inferiority complex? Keep thinking so highly of yourself, I'm sure it'll do great things for you pal. You're aren't this patient's physician, or even a physician at all, so leave the work to them and don't go out spreading potential misinformation."
"if it’s gods will……it’s okay. honestly for me, death is such a blessing. and not in a “i’m a dark and twisty person” kinda way. i really think that to be free of this cruel and hateful world. is such a gift. imagine being 14 and already having ur mindset. one can only imagine. people ask why the good people always die early. i’d like to think god is saving them from what’s coming next and what life u might’ve had. there’s so many pointless things at this point. i’d like to die. i want to die. but i’m not suicidal. i’m not depressed. just want to meet my maker and thank him for this extraordinary life."

"When I was young my father used to read me a poem by William Ernest Henley called Invictus. Then roughly 3 decades later when my first son was born 10 weeks premature at 2 pounds 14 ounces (he’s fine now), I would hold his hand and read that poem to him. As a mantra of sorts - of defiance to what challenges the world throws at you…  “Out of the night that covers me,       Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be       For my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutch of circumstance       I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance       My head is bloody, but unbowed.  Beyond this place of wrath and tears       Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years       Finds and shall find me unafraid.  It matters not how strait the gate,       How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate,       I am the captain of my soul.”"

"This will be OK.  I am a physician (but not your physician). No surgeon is willing to do a surgery of this nature if they think you will die. No one wants that on their conscience.

I hope you have a speedy recovery from your surgery. Unfortunately, this is a long road ahead. These lesions can potentially undergo malignant degeneration into a chondrosarcoma. Remain vigilant."

I’ve been where you are. At 21 I went in for my first brain surgery &amp; made my parents a ‘love you if I die!!’ Card. I wasn’t ready. I knew they were even more NOT ready. I was more worried about them than me. I’m nearly 42. 3 craniotomies &amp; lots of other surgeries later…I’m here. I have an 8 yr old amazing son. I own my home.

"We were given absolutely no information about what a physician may or may not have said. That was my earlier point. What I do know, intimately, is statistics. Specifically in the medical field and regarding surgical outcomes. And everything I said, given the information provided, was accurate. It is entirely possible that this child has never spoken to, or seen, the surgeon(s) involved. We don’t know where the information came from, and you’re out of your mind if you think that individual surgeons take the time to calculate the statistics for each patient. We have no idea. So presenting my informed (because I am, regardless of what you think) opinion on accurate information regarding this kids surgical outcomes is not prognosticating. I told him what I can reasonably determine given the information provided. Also, you cannot “override” information (whatever that means), regardless of what you think.  But more to the point, given he directly replied to me, do you think the kid may have seen what I wrote, and check the replies to that? I stand by what I said, but that’s not the point. You saw a message that made a child in a crisis situation feel better. And your response was to try and… what? Make it worse for him? Take away any hope it may have given him? Go “uh… actually”. What’s the purpose of that? You saw something you have no knowledge of, and was benefiting a child, and chose to behave poorly. That’s where my determination about your inferiority comes from; confident people don’t feel the need to lash out like that.   And I suppose what makes me mad is this: what if I was lying through my teeth? What if I made it up to make the kid feel better? Is that something worth undoing? If the lie was right and he survives: then he would recover and go on with his life. If it wasn’t, then at least he died with a tad bit more hope than he might have otherwise. I’d like to reiterate what I said is accurate. However, something made you such a bitter and small person to see that situation and make the choice you did. That’s where my judgement of you comes in. You don’t know the science, so I’m not going to even argue that. You hide behind this weak “well I didn’t reply to him directly” excuse as you lash out in a way that could very well hurt someone who may desperately need help.   I’ll say this again. I sincerely hope that you get whatever help you need to be a better person. But in this moment, right now, you’ve made an ass of yourself. So go fuck yourself."

I had surgery recently which was 1h long and it took me 1.5h to wake up from the anesthesia after. I was also super groggy and drowsy for at least several hours after so I wouldn’t expect to receive an update from OP that soon given that his surgery was likely quite long and also need to factor in him recovering from the anesthesia.
"This may sound wrong to others. I hope everything goes well for you and if not, I hope you have a peaceful passing."

"If you listen to stories from people with terminal illnesses, a lot of folks struggle with being able to talk about death with their friends and loved ones. Terminally ill people want to be able to feel whatever it is they feel - fear of death, acceptance of death, guilty about leaving loved ones behind, resentment about their situation, etc.  These are all incredibly heavy feelings, especially in a society which does not have a very good relationship with dying (or that has virtually NO relationship with death and dying).  Layered onto all of this are bad ideas we've inherited about the ""strength"" required to beat illnesses. When you call someone a survivor, the implication is that those people who didn't beat the disease in question are *not* survivors. When you praise someone for ""being so strong"" you are contrasting that with those other ""weak"" people with the disease. There is a lot of baggage we carry around about how a person is supposed to face a terminal illness, and very little of it is actually helpful to a person with a terminal illness.  Then you have the feelings of the people around the terminally ill person: a lot of people want to live in denial, or in fantasy that things will work out, or turn to God or a ""master plan"" for solace. People who will live on after someone are trying to figure out how they are going to do that. The way that supporters of people with terminal illnesses cope with their own feelings may not be the best way for the terminally ill person to cope with their feelings, but unfortunately this inevitable gets projected on to them, too.  I think the most important thing you can do for someone who is severely ill or who is dying is to be there with them (when they want you to be), to listen to them, and most importantly, to just sit with how they are feeling. You don't need to solve it, you don't need to make them feel better, just let them feel how they're feeling, and feel it along with them if you can. They are in a situation beyond anyone's control. It can be a terrifying feeling to not be in control. But it's a feeling that comes from a correct assessment of the reality of the situation.  If it gets to that point, you can be with them when they die. That's about all you're able to do in those situations, but it's actually a lot.  It takes a great force of will to face death. This is just as true for a dying person as it is for people close to the dying person, and we all have to come to it in our own way."

Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

There are so many days when it feels like ""well, if I'm gone at least the pain is gone"" it's a very real thought, and it's a valid one.   Living the kind of lives we do can be incredibly difficult. There's days where you feel like you just can't keep going, you can't picture continuing this way for the rest of your life. And that's a very true reality.  There's also days when you realize that there are some amazing things and people in your life, that wouldn't be there if you hadn't gone though what you did. Does it make it easier? Technically no, but it's wonderful and important to hold on to. And if you don't have those things yet, you will.   I'm 30 years old, and got my diagnosis at 11. The conditions may not get better, but our lives, your life, will.   Looking forward to seeing you on the other side my friend."

"Religion can help many people but it is best to let those who wish to be saved discover the religion, and their personal way to worship that religion, on their own. Religion is a very personal thing and should be treated as such. Not just recited to make someone believe. It’s more than just petty lines said to convince others how they must be saved. It’s worth more to the people who truly believe than just that. So let those who need it find their way to where they wish to go and let those who don’t need or wish saving go the way they wish."
"Your friends do not understand chronic pain.  They think from their pain-free perspective not realizing what we endure each and everyday.  Finding the right pain med, then dealing with insurance pre-approval, then meeting all the govt restrictions and limits because addicts abuse good pain meds, taking the meds, hoping you do not become tolerant, taking only enough so you can still be productive to live life.  And the times when nothing seems to help the pain. Until they can actually empathize they will NEVER understand the acceptance of our situation.  Not they we wish to hurry it along, or hurt ourselves, but acceptance that modern medicine still cannot fix everything, nor can they stop us from dying."

"Think of it this way: he/she may not believe in hell.  So what you're *actually* doing is condemning them to hell as a threat to advocate for your hateful rhetoric: renounce before it's too late.  Telling a dying kid they're going to hell if they don't sign up for membership before it's too late is unbelievably fucking sick.  It is shockingly despicable.  This is what makes christians like you despicable; you pretend that salvation and God are about love, when it's really just about fear.  If it wasn't, and hell was truly not a threat but a justice and consequence to sinful behaviour, then it would make no difference whatsoever if OP believed in Jesus or not.  Because then, the only criteria for salvation would be to be a good person and *nothing else*.  Why would Jesus care if anyone gave him credit, so long as they practiced the compassion and kindness he sought to teach?  But the fact that the ONLY way to heaven is through Christ, means it isn't about justice - it's about membership.  And that hell is a threat.  And here you are threatening a kid facing their morality down because you need to sell your sick fucking cult for your sick fucking ego.  OP found their peace.  And here you are disrupting it and threatening them with damnation.  *Exactly* how Westboro Church does.  Who also claim to be about ""love"" and ""salvation"".  If you really cared about OP, you'd ask what they believed first.  That compassion and understanding your zombie wizard apparently tried to preach and pass.  But you didn't.  Because yours is a religion that has always preyed on the sick and vulnerable precisely like you're doing now.  Love.  Please.  As if you even know the meaning of the word."

"Your physical body dies, but we all have a soul. Why can’t all of humanity take a dead body, even if the body has only been dead for one second, and bring it back to life? They have everything physical that they would need for a living person, but there is MORE than  just the physical body. We cannot create life. When our soul leaves our body, then our physical body turns to dust. But our soul is eternal."

"""People who reply with quotes think they are quite smart."""
"I think they meant that they’ve already spent time with ppl they care about, not that the surgery is done. the surgery should have started about 2 hours ago"
Maybe you should blame every goverent that's still spending money to solve their own starvation and poverty because they aren't donating that money to Ukraine. According to your logic they're all assholes. I don't understand how you have the audacity to call anyone selfish.
"We broke the Law (the Ten Commandments) Jesus paid the price. Being a good person comes from human thinking, not God’s thinking. NOBODY is a good person. As I said in my first comment, everybody has sinned and death is the wages of that sin.  Asking the OP what he believes is not important to reality. Whether he believes in hell or not doesn’t change the fact that hell exists.  Love from God, true, unconditional love from God, is shown through Him giving us His Son, He paid for our sins so that we don’t have to. How is that not love?   John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.   Jesus laid down His (perfect, sinless) life for us. That is the ultimate love."

But we are all in this together, one way or the other, with more time or less time, our time is limited and our existence is basic survival. I know it’s hard, but try to hold on to hopes and stay positive, life is good!"

Yo we better get an update! Fucking pull thru dude.
"You are right, I didn’t even bother to think how long the procedure would be. For sure gonna have to check in here and there."
"My brother had Duchenne’s MD, the doctors told us when he was 13 that he’d die within a week, so from the age of 11, I was constantly in fear of him dying. He lived another amazing 15 years with us. I know you’ll make it through this, and have many great years in which you teach those around you more than they could ever learn without you. You exalt all of those around you, even those you’ve never met before, like myself."
"Well your friends are wrong. They also do not live your life. Only you can choose what is right for you. If i was in your shoes i would think the exact same. The chance of reducing or eliminating the pain is would be worth it. I think its normal not fearing death, when the opposite is less than ideal. You are a strong person at age 14. Whatever happens. I wish you the best in life."
But this is some 30yo Indian guy waiting for money in his DMS
And I still can't imagine actually losing the battle.   Thank you!
Good luck !!!! Good vibes your way.

"From another that beat all odds, you got this. Here's to hoping you come out the other end!!!"
"I hope you will do a little better after the surgery. It’s a rough hand you’ve been dealt. As someone who lives in constant pain, I completely understand being okay with dying. It’s a very valid feeling to have when one doesn’t have such good quality of life. I wish you all the best though. Let us know that you’re alright when you can."
Praying for you man. I believe in miracles. And you will be healed!
"Dude you're going to be the best rainbow some have ever seen, influence somebody, than pass on cause even if this surgery were a success, you really don't have anything but more pain to look forward too. Just being realistic. Sure, You may experience birthdays, happiness,  sadness, maybe even love and heartbreak, but that lvl 5 reminder of death will always stay.   Sooo, if that's what you really want than I'll say a prayer for you and hope everything works out.  Personally, I've been trying to speed run this run-through of life but it keeps on preventing me from dying lol.  Like phones, life is just a thing only the living get to complain about. Once your gone, the only ones who suffer are people still alive. It may be callous, morose, morbid, or despicable of me to say, but in a hundred  years who really will care, or even know.   Do what you can, with what you got, where you are. I hope you come back as a giant, ass star!"

You’re not alone little brother &lt;3 I (19f) had 17 surgeries by 7. Technically died twice before I was 4. Had several more surgeries since and am hanging out at 21 right now. I’ve got a whole host of health problems and am one of those people who couldn’t leave their house for months when COVID first hit. I’m still alive and kicking and going to college for my dream job.  Young bodies are amazing as is determination. When you’re conscious again choose to fight bud. Life is tiring and hard and sometimes a forever nap sounds great but you’ll be amazed at how much better life gets with time. I never had friends as a kid and never thought I’d find love because of my disability. I’m still working on the whole friends thing because I’m socially awkward but I am dating the most wonderful man I’ve ever met.  I know you’ll wake up in a few hours drugged up on the good stuff and won’t even remember you made this Reddit post at first but when you do know that all of us internet strangers are supporting you and sending love and good vibes/prayers/whatever their equivalent is.

"sActually, you sound like a very well-adjusted person -- it takes a great deal of strength of character to acknowledge reality, face it head-on, and accept whatever comes.  It is perfectly reasonable to accept that death is a possibility in your circumstances because it IS.  Your friends are like most people, who fear death &amp; so refuse to discuss or face it.  And many people believe that a positive attitude is the key, but of course it doesn't matter how positive your outlook, people die because their body fails.   Its sad for them because acknowledging death is important for living fully.  I hope fate, and your doctors,  gives you more time for living and the physical means to walk through it.  Your in the thoughts of many people today.  Good luck"

"Wow. I think your in an ok headspace your not wrong you just have a different perspective then most your age. Hell most people only get this kind of claritrty when they are in their retirement. Being a peace with your potential death is not the sign of some sort of suicidal thoughts or mental illness. It’s similar to people who don’t want doctors to “do everything they can” just to get a few extra months on “living” in a hospital bed. I forget exactly what it’s called I think Do not resuscitate is involved. So yeah don’t worry about your friends they just don’t have your perspective hopeful they will come to terms with their mortality in their own time and fashion.

""ghost"" Energy cannot be created nor destroyed and your soul is made up of the energy firing in your synapsis and all throughout your body. when the body ceases function, the energy is not destroyed. if you have affirmed the intention to assimilate and remain, it is definitely plausible, right? i mean, after they proved energy reacts to intention i feel like that was all the proof we needed for the spirit world. God Bless, or whatever, lol I wish you many rebirths and a healthy dance with temptations that allow you all the brilliance our energies can experience.

"He literally went into Surgery two hours ago? And that's if there wasn't a delay. Are you aware some surgery's take over 6 hours? And it may take another 4-10 hours under sedation post surgery to recover? Anaesthesia, pain medications and sedatives take Days to wear off.

"I(30M) have the same thing, Osteochondromatosis.  292 growths to be exact. 13 of which are visible. I haven’t been to the doctor’s in 9 years. Mine were all benign back then. They grew until I hit 16/17 and just stopped(this disease usually stunts growth. Makes you shorter. Fingers, arms, different lengths) but like you stated some days I wake up and the osteochondroma is in a bad spot and the pain can be excruciating for hours, days, sometimes even months.  My hips and left knee are the worst and the growths are highly visible there. I had a few sawn off from my right shoulder and forearm when i was younger( 8and 11 years old). The pain from surgery was expected but the relief from constant pain was worth it. It is very rare tumors from this disease are malignant. Most just inhibit your growth but you can definitely live a normal life. Good luck OP. Keep your head up."
"I just scroll through Reddit here and there but tonight I’m so glad I did so I can pray for you and the best outcome. With much love, a Mom."
Thank you for sharing that. This is all daunting and I applaud all of you for getting through life with MHE. Reminds me to not take my health for granted. Wish you all well!
"&gt; If it works, great, I can walk again. If it fails and my condition stays the same/deteriorates, I've adapted to this disease enough. I can probably handle a few turns for the worst. And if I die, well, I suppose then there is no more pain.  I know exactly how you feel and I think it's ok.  I too live in constant pain that will never go away. I have 4 grown children and a new grandbaby so I do not in any way WANT to die and I would never consider taking my own life but if I didn't wake up tomorrow... no more pain so I would be OK with that.   I think it's ok to be at peace with death but please hold on to the part that would PREFER life.  And BTW if there is something after this life, my [Jake](https://i.imgur.com/BJxMSIH.jpg) better be there or I'm fuckin leaving!  (lost my best friend 2 years ago today)"

"I am. It’s also the chemical released when you dream. I think you have a fantastic interpretation of my experience, thank you for sharing.   To explain a touch further, I’m not religious and was barely spiritual at the time. However it was the first psychedelic I had considered trying and I prayed about it. Went outside by myself, it was literally a breeze less night. I sat down by a tree and asked God if he wanted me to make this choice, if it was the right thing to do etc. As soon as I asked a lovely breeze ruffled my hair. So that may have contributed to my experience.   The second time I did dmt a few weeks later, it was more of a fuck it let’s get high (I was making many horrible choices at the time). My trip that time was terrifying. I was Anne freaking Frank, I went through years in the attic. When I came to, the nazis were just about to come in. I had somehow gotten under the bed and was throwing up.   Both of my experiences felt like years even though they were actually only 15 minutes.   Memories I haven’t thought about in years and I haven’t done DMT since, though I would if given the opportunity from someone I trust.   Kids- Take drugs from friends, never strangers."

Hope things turned out well for you! I’m very familiar with MHE. Several of my family members (including my mom and sister) have this and it can be very debilitating at times. After my sister’s last surgery some years ago she went back to ask about removing a tumor in her shoulder but the doctor said they wouldn’t do it because there was an artery wrapped around it. My aunt had one tumor turn cancerous at the age of 9 and lost her leg up to the hip. That was probably nearly 50 years ago. Now she suffers from phantom limb syndrome and has to be taken to the ER from time to time to deal with the pain in her nonexistent leg. Thankfully no one else has suffered such serious complications although my other aunt just had surgery for one on her knee and has been having a difficult time recovering.

Being comfortable with the truth of your future death is healthy.   Have a positive procedure and a quick healing  --- fyi  One of the foundations of Buddhism is impermanence and one of our practices is the creation of a diary for our death bed so that those who sit with us in death can read us back positive memories of our lives. Because the last thought of this life is the first feeling of the next. Meditation is itself a practice for both living and dieing with a loving open heart.  Generally speaking Americans have an unhealthy relationship with death and grieving. I'll make the generalization that is true for most western developed countries.

"As a person who has been in similar shoes facing possible imminent death head on, what happens next is what happens next (fact of life that you know). And there is nothing wrong with you being okay with that. It’s a good (immensely wise) mental place to be. Many things around us are simply out of our control. Worrying about what may or may not happen will not change what happens next, just your own emotional experience leading up to the pivotal moment. So to me, it sounds like you are in a very good place mentally. I wish you the absolute best outcome. And no need to fret. It’s wise to be calm in these hours. Enjoy these moments you know for certain you have. Living in the moment can be very freeing - which I’m sure you are experiencing right now.   Loved ones and other well meaning people will project their fears into you. It’s just how it goes. They can’t help it. They care and don’t want to possibly loose you, which is understandable because you seem like a really wise, great person.   I’m here wishing you the best. Sending all my love your way. No matter what happens next, it will be okay and it’s truly awesome that you know that, and are at peace with whatever is to come. Though we are strangers to one another, my heart is with yours.

"I have the same bone disease.   In 2015, for a period of roughly 6 months, bone spurs on and around my knee began pinching nerves and putting me in crippling pain every time I bent my leg. I then had a surgery in which these bone spurs were removed, alongside bone spurs that were stabbing into my adductor muscle and causing it to cramp for up to six hours at a time.  Following that surgery, I had another surgery one month later to remove a rather massive benign bone tumor from my calf on the same leg. The doctors were unsure if it was benign or malignant at the time, but it was caused by the same bone disease.   I had all the same thoughts about how either of the surgeries may have wound up being the end. Made for a rather meditative experience, all in all. Being okay with dying makes sense when you're looking at your options and you know it's a genuine possibility, however small - you need to make your peace with it if you want to move forward without fear.  I'm assuming you'll get through the surgeries intact, in that the specialist surgeons nowadays are very competent. That said, the hardest part of all of this is the recovery. The nerve pain you'll be dealing with for a few months is quite intense, especially for the first couple months. Pain meds will take the edge off, but only somewhat. Because nerves heal slowly, you'll likely find yourself wondering if you will ever get better, or if you'll have to just deal with this from now on. It's far from a speedy recovery, but for me, my nerve pain was largely gone around 4 months post-surgery &amp; totally alleviated within 6 months. Your mileage may vary.  The best unsolicited advice I can give is to do physical therapy / exercise (within reason) every day as soon as you can bear to do so. Post-surgery muscle atrophy isn't fun, particularly because your leg muscles can weaken to the point that they're in a state of semi-constant hypertension - or at least, mine were. I could stretch for an hour and find temporary relief, only to find my muscles went right back to being painfully tense shortly afterwards. Avoid that by doing your physical therapy early and often, when you can. (I eventually got relief when I was treated by a massage specialist who works with MMA fighters and other athletes, for what it's worth.)  Best of luck with this &amp; any follow-up operations. Hopefully you don't try to eat the first alcohol swab you see upon waking up post-surgery, like I did."

Good luck bro, I can't even imagine what I'd have missed if I checked out at your age.

I've had an extreme surgery with the risk of death and it didn't bother me either. Being dead is easy. It's suffering that's tough.  I also didn't mind being in the hospital. Most people don't get that either. The pain meds are great and you don't have any responsibilities. I'd lay there and watch a web cam on a bird feeder and fade in and out of consciousness for hours. It was quite pleasant.  Good luck and enjoy your stay!

Percentages for survival change overtime. When I was born I had a surgery that claimed less than 1% chance of survival. Now decades later we know its closer to 98% chance of survival.  I then had a similar surgery at 16 with similar odds. at the time... now those odds are improved drastically.  All these surgeries tended to be performed on children to teenagers.  I think you'll be ok. Good luck. Hope you feel better.

"The abled don’t like to think about death and don’t have to confront it because they don’t have painful chronic conditions that might kill them or  make them wish they were dead. So you confronting your mortality and seeing it as a friend instead of a scary foe doesn’t make sense to them.  If you really want to see how healthy people react to the idea of suicide for those with health problems see the comments whenever anyone brings up euthanasia. The Nazis get thrown around like allowing people with extremely painful or terminal conditions to die on their own terms is the same as genocide of the handicapped. We treat our pets better than we do people.   I am almost 45 and have dealt with very painful conditions since my 20s. I’ve even had a stroke at 26. My family other than my husband still doesn’t like to talk about my condition and my wishes if I got to where I couldn’t make my own decisions about my health. (I really need to set of a medical power of attorney and a living will).   When you’re young, surgery sounds really scary. It’s scary for adults, too. The surgeons always have to give you all the facts including all risks so the patient and in your case your legal guardians can make an informed decision. The odds of you dying is incredibly low. The surgery should help your condition and give you some relief although the grows might come back.   If you’re in the US, doctors are weird about giving young people pain meds even when they need them. There is a risk of addiction, and people confuse dependance (your body has to be weaned off the meds if you take them long term) with addiction (taking opiates will cause you to crave them so you run off and start taking them without medical need). There are pain management doctors who are anesthesiologists with extra training in treating pain and helping people by prescribing opiates and other medications. There are non opiate meds that help pain. If you don’t already have a pain management doctor I really suggest you get one. They are amazing, and they have procedures that lower the risk of addiction.  If your pain isn’t controlled after surgery, or God forbid, the surgery doesn’t work, you can ask for a pain management doctor referral. You could also do that in other countries. If you feel like you can’t stop taking your opiates after surgery, cut them in half and then fourths and gradually wean off. Surgeons aren’t the best at helping patients wean off their pain meds.   You should be fine. Your surgery should really help. I hope and pray it does. It is scary to have surgery. There’s some meds the anesthesiologist can give you after you sign your consent forms in pre op. Tell them you’re nervous, and they’ll give you something to relax. The warm blankets also help.   I always lean back under my warm blankets and image my happy place. Which for me is lying on the warm sand under the sun listening to ocean waves. YouTube has a lot of relaxation videos that are several hours of calming nature sounds. You could listen to one in pre op.   Good luck, and I hope the surgery is 100% successful."

"I never comment on Reddit, but this especially hits home for me as I have this disease and began surgeries when I turned 13. I won’t lie to you, the process is grueling and the road ahead is arduous. In my case I had six procedures: three bone surgeries each, totaling 18. You are so strong and you will make it through this. Technology has come so far and orthopedic surgeons have gotten so good with minimally invasive techniques. Today, I am able to walk normally and can lift weights as tolerated. I was able to go to college at 18 and walk around campus lifting my backpack. In fact, if all of my scars are covered, you would assume nothing was out of the ordinary about me! I got gifted the ability to live a (sonewhat) normal life, and I hope that is the same gift that awaits you at the end of your recovery. I will be rooting for you, CaptAndrew12. You’re a legend, never forget it."
Really hope to hear back from you OP.
"You're going to be okay.  I've gone through a few Oh Shit moments myself, with cancer and other things.  My only advice, that I think encapsulates the mindset you need to have going forward is: Push. Push forward. Fuck life. Fuck everyone who has wronged you. And fuck this fucking disease. Push. And that includes anything after.  Good luck and I hope you make it past this."

I was wanting to ask the same. I’m originally from a country which for some reason seems to have a high prevalence of this or a similar condition.
"I desperately hoping to see OP reply...  Edit: leukemia survivor here, have had 8 reconstructive surgeries and more to come (to fix the dmg from all the chemo). I cant empathize with your prognosis, but I can with dealing with pain every minute of every day. The idea of being pain free becomes welcoming even if it means death.

"it's kind of weird for your friends to tell you what's right or wrong to feel about life when you were dealt a really unfortunate hand.   they have the luxury of giving you that ""it gets better!"" and ""fight to live!"" perspective because for them, they do not have the struggle of knowing the agony and having one's mortality dangled in front of them. it's easy to say ""you should not be okay with dying"" when there is no more threat of passing than what they generally experience as a layperson without critical medical conditions. there's actually quite a few threats to life during the course of one's day, getting in a car at any point being one example, but no one really thinks about that because it'd be kind of silly to always look at life through a mortal lens when one does not have to.   there's a bunch of comments here that suggest your odds are better than you may realize, and i hope it works out for you.   i think it's okay to have your perspective on life, as you seem to recognize that at some point we're faced with the reality that we don't live forever, but unfortunately you had to see it much earlier than anyone expects to."

When I went to the ER on day 5, they confirmed the heart attack with a simple blood test, informed me that my heart was only pumping out 30% what it should be, and scheduled me for an open heart bypass.  All told it was 8 days in the hospital, they cracked me open like a lobster and put me back together with a bunch of wires and brackets on the inside.  Yeah, technically, any of it could have killed me, and I had a year of complications following it with congestive heart failure and low blood pressure that made me pass out multiple times.  It sucked. There was a TON of pain and agony and I still have aches to this day 1200+ days later.  But I survived. You CAN do this."

My brother died of Leukemia at 23, so it might be a hereditary thing. Either way, I understand the level of shitty you’re talking about. If you told me you believe in Christ, then I sincerely wouldn’t worry the least bit. If not, dude, please open your heart to the possibilities. The main point is it’s a 50/50 chance.

These times you rly hate drug companies because of their money making business.  She also had sometimes pretty bad boosts of heavy pain where she couldn't move at all, she just laid in bed screaming and criing of pain, but she refuses to take any kind of painkillers at all... Pretty strong woman, much respect for everyone dealing with this kind of shit!!  Do you have randomly boosts of pain at all?  Go for surgery, she had like 15,16 surgery's at all.

"Heyyy, how are you? How did it go?"
"I just wanted you to know that I found your thoughtful comment very beautiful. I struggle with a lot of death anxiety. Grew up in a doomsday cult lol. Armageddon was always around the corner, in my eyes as a kid/teen. I figured god was gonna unalive me because I knew I didn’t wanna be in it and was suicidal for a while when I left - but it all changed when I started doing LSD and MDMA and had a point of reference for what it’s like to feel…I can’t explain it but it’s a certain type of happiness. I think mindfulness, possibly? A certain type of contentedness. Sorry for the rambling response lol. Idk it kind of made me feel better. These days the LSD still helps with the death anxiety; I do it about twice a year. Long enough to keep the magic but close enough to remember the point of reference.   The first time it ever made me feel better about dying, my visuals turned to sugar skulls amongst the geometry. They were more vivid with my eyes closed, of course. I thought about what they represent. I really like them in general so it’s probably why my mind showed me them, but it helped. I’m overweight and it contributes to my health anxiety so I’ve been slowly getting healthier. I realized that one way to not fear death is to try to make the best of things and take care of the weird meat machine that enables me to interact with the world, lol. Try to get therapy because dissociating takes me out of my body and I really should try to be more present in my own life.  I didn’t mean to infodump…everyone is asleep and I’m just kind of up alone with my thoughts. Your comment really got me thinking. And some of this stuff is so big to me that I’m not completely sure what to do with it. I’m an atheist and had the most spiritual experience of my entire life and it had nothing to do with religion or even believing in a higher power. If there’s a higher power it’s something like gravity or time or energy itself idk lol. But there’s nobody I can really tell who would get it, so I tell strangers on the internet lol. Idk, thanks for the thoughtful comment :)"

"ok so i (15f) also have MHE, and there's a few things you should probably know. I've been diagnosed since i was 4 and have had surgery a few times a year since i was 7, I had my twentieth in January, and the doctor said there was high risk on most of them. either I'm the luckiest bitch ever or they're overhyping how dangerous it is. as for your friends saying it's weird you don't care about dying, it's not. I'm not actively suicidal but I am passively suicidal. I'm not gonna hang myself but I'm not gonna take any action to prevent my death either, like a seatbelt, simply because existing is so incredibly painful id honestly welcome death. i know you're already out of the OR but i gotta say a few bits of advice: recoverys gonna be a bitch, make sure you got the beefiest insurance ever when you turn 18 (if you're in a country without universal healthcare) and please, please, please, watch the pain meds. i overdosed on ibuprofen after one surgery where they took off both my fibulas so i could walk again, and as a result of that overdose, even though it's been 4 years i still cannot take ibuprofen and have to take antacids twice a day to prevent the stomach issues it caused. please don't make the mistake i did lol. also if you ever wanna dm me about anything MHE related I'm happy to answer, cause i definitely got the experience lol"

"Just commenting to say I’m happy to read that you’re alive and well.♥️ Been through a rough day with my anxiety and all, but reading this kinda restored my faith in life. Hugs OP."
So glad to see you made it mate! Best of luck on a speedy recovery!!
Yes!!!!!! Congrats I hope you don’t have to do that again!
Godspeed my guy
Glad you came out of it okay dude!
You got this bro
My man! Congratulations on the successful surgery and Godspeed to a healthy and fruitful life!!! It’s only up from here champ! Don’t worry bout nuttin!!
How are you now man?
The crazy bastard did it. And only at 14. Keep on kicking life's ass
"Fuck yeah.  Happy to see you made it, OP."
"I love the way you write out your thoughts as you have them. Gives a glimpse of who you are. Most people probly just call this rambling..i tend to do this.  Your comment made me want to share...not sure how reddit works yet. So dont know if appropriate..but im sharing..anyway..  .. ive analized / life / death / religion etc...so much ive come to believe we ARE the Energy.   It explains alot....someone told me when you die you lose 6grams of weight ( or something like that.)...life force...soul...energy..  Is released from body...and maybe we just merge into surrounding energy.     The near death tunnel of white light ??maybe not a path to anywhere but we.die and merge into the light.  ? Maybe people see loved ones at end of tunnel cuz their brains gave them that comfort to accept death.   reincarnation...1 soul through many bodies??....how about many souls ( energy) into 1 body being born.? (... Baby born ....energy  in room enters baby?   .  People remember past lives...usually traumatic death...but dont remember whole life...just bits pieces maybe the sudden death....makes some of that energy stick together....and baby will have the memory of the sudden death.    Maybe strong talent sticks together also...explains child prodigy....baby born gets a large ""chunk"" of  energy of beethoven can play outrageously talented at 4 yrs old.  It explains ghosts....if you can die and keep your consciousness (energy) together...you would be a ghost.?  Astral projection?...the ability to control (and travel) the consciousness outside the body.  But what about evil ? Ive seen evil..many have...    Energy has polarity  neg/ pos.   I believe...right?   Baby gets born a little too much neg energy.....bad seed/ evil...more positive energy goes in baby you got mother theresa?  It kinda makes yin/yang make more sense.     Didntthe alien ships found use some sort of thought to control ship.  What if space travel is not speed of light... but speed of energy....aka thought....  Ever have ESP stuff happen while on LSD?  I spoke with a friend that was clear across a smoke filled dark room ( no chance of lip reading or gestures) that had concert size speakers blasting so loud..you couldnt hear someone screaming in your ear. we had a 3 or 4 minute interaction speaking calmly and clearly...didnt reaize we were talking with our minds until next day.    Stay strong ....emotions arent too bad once you feel them...ive met person extreme (VERYtraumatic childhood) HID FROM LIFE for years and years and she is now starting to experience feelings....finally..having them i guess is Not as scary as the thought of having them. Good luck. Thx for sharin"
So happy for you! Hoping for a fast recovery!
"I’ve literally been worried about this all day at work, So glad you’re ok my G ❤️"
"Godspeed, OP."
GOOD TO SEE YA PAL!!!!
"Not really the same but I'm blind in my right eye and have scoliosis no I have a hunch and people always hated me bc I was ""ugly"" but I love my blind eye its part of me. the scoliosis tho? Nah fuck that lol"
"OP is alive!! Wooooooooo!!!! 🎉🎉🎉  Now sit stay and heal, OP!! 😁👍"
LETS GO OP!!!!! KICK SOME ***
Hate be be cynical but this isn't the first time someone has posted something like this which turned out to be fake. It's amazing how many people still fall for this.
"There's nothing wrong with accepting death. Not being scared of dying is actually a really unique and rare sign of strength. To know you might not make it to tomorrow and to be okay with that takes SO MUCH mental fortitude and honesty.  People think it's weird or not okay because your brain tells you death is scary, but it doesn't have to be. You're a strong person, OP. Society may not think the acceptance of death is okay, but society doesn't live your life.  Glad you made it out okay! Best wishes to you and your recovery."
HE’S BACK!!!
You are so fucking brave
Edit 2 is so good. Happy for you!
"AAAAA CONGRATS OP, YOU FUCKIN DID IT"
LETS FUCKING GOOOO MY G STARIGHT WS
"I somewhat agree. Personally, though, I can only give it the benefit of the doubt; and to me, a few simple, kind words would never hurt."
I understand why your friends would tell you what they did. But these are also likely people who have not had to live with a chronic debilitating painful disease for a very long time. When you go through things like this you begin to realize things about life or death that other people would not even think of because they don’t have a similar experience. It is quite reasonable for you to feel the way you did before going into surgery. And honestly I think it’s rather healthy. To recognize the fact that you are not afraid of a potential outcome means you also don’t have to manage the anxiety and the guilt and the fear and you can just live in the moment. I’m glad surgery went well I hope recovery improves your function.
"Congrats on pulling through! Glad you're still with us, and I hope you'll recover quickly!"
This made my day!! So happy for the update. Sending you all the good vibes for a strong recovery. 💕🎉🦄
"&gt;I'M ALIVE, LES GOOOO. Recovery pain's a bitch but otherwise, I'm fine  I'm sorry.  You'll just have to suffer with life like the rest of us ;)"
damn boi you now have reddit remium until you die.
Gaggle of geese?
Good luck in healing and recovery. Your outlook on death is not unhealthy. To me it sounds like you have accepted that you cannot control every outcome in your life and you are already willing to live with the results.   You are young for this sort of maturity and it will serve you well. Your mental fortitude is going to keep you in the game LONG after this surgery is complete.   Best wishes
I have a scale it is 0% to 100% is I have 50% something bad will happen I will think if I have 40% than I will fell ok but if i have 50% or higher I would be scared
"Wooooh, let’s go! U the goat my man 🐐!!!   (this emoji, for this one time, is necessary, okay Reddit?)  Edit: woops, I don’t know why I replied to you, but my message was for OP lol.."
That’s the kinda update I was waiting for.   Speedy recovery dude.
"I can read. Before I slept there was no second edit and when I woke up there was another edit, so it worked and I’ll do it again."
"OP, sending this because I’m thinking about you this morning. Hope all went well, saying prayers for you!"
Hahaha is that what you go round saying you little nonce. I hope you get fucked by a pedo we’ll see how often you’ll say it then
"Look at this strong ass badass no fucking given ass surviving major surgery ass go ahead and cut up my bones ass I'm still standing ass motherfucker!!!! I'm proud of you man, enjoy your life!"
Did you live?
WAY TO GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
"Thank god it went fine. As a 13 yo, I admire you. I don’t think I could handle something like that. But I hope you never have to deal with anything scary like that again, and you can go back to living your life. Good luck"
Great job bro - hope you have a quick recovery!
Glad you made it through! Yay.
Glad you made it OP!
THEY NADE IT
Glad you're okay dude!
Fabulous to see you made it through the other side!
"First thing I did this morning when I woke up is, come on here and check to see if you made it through and I'm glad you did. Stay strong and keep going."
"Yo, check his page! Kid lived!"
"So happy for your OP!!! You’re alive and that’s so amazing !! Not many people are as optimistic or glad to live as you are, let alone have a community of people being so proud of u!! :)   this made my day, thank you OP!"
"As someone who deals with an absolutely insane amount of pain with no expectation to ever not, yeah they probably are trying to be supportive but it rings badly because they are still projecting that you should want to live and not be okay with dying without listening to the reason or that you are trying to be at peace with the situations you face.  Honestly they probably just don’t want you to die and you being okay with dying probably just sets off alarm bells for them.  Edit to add: as someone who has faced down death often enough to become at least a little numb and accepting of it if it comes, I understand what you mean. They, likely, don’t. It’s not experience I’d wish on anyone. Be safe and happy recovery. I hope you live a long life and find a day you aren’t in agony and don’t have to face this stuff down again."
CONGRATS ON SURVIVING BRO LMFAO
YOU LIVED!!? LETS GOOOO MAN.
"OP the best thing you can do in life is to accept death, and that It will inevitably happen at any point in time. After that nothing can phase you. I hope that you beat the odds and made it out alive but if not, I hope that you are at peace finally."
Your a badass in my opinion op. Hope stuff starts to get a little easier for you. Your attitude and mindset is quite inspiring it's not that you look forward to death you just have no fear of it. I guess that would be kind of freeing in a sense to no longer fear what comes for us all in the end. Anyways I wish nothing but the best for you and I'm glad you surgeries went well. Your the real MVP to me and probably quite a few other people so don't forget it. Have a great day bro
"WAY TO GO OP!!!! Congratulations! I wish you a full and beautiful life with lots of laughter, lots of cute animals to pet, and tons of fun activities with your friends! :D"
Glad to see you did it :)
What sort of hobbies do you enjoy?
Congrats on the surgery! Best of luck going forward!
Fuck👏yes👏
Wtf did u say? That made no sense
You are way stronger and wiser than your years! Your outlook is very poetic and I wish you all the best 🙌
Exactly so. I do recommend respecting psychedelics!
That's great news that you made it through surgery.  Hopefully recovery goes well and your pain recedes.
Exactly my thoughts too!
WTF lol

Don't accept death! Accept Jesus Christ instead.  Call Lord Jesus with every breath you take.  Who ever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved! Believe it and it's done! Your faith shall make you whole.

cheers to a successful surgery!  Hopefully you are not in the US
Glad to hear all went well. Best of luck for your recovery!

"You made it!! I’m happy you made it out. Strive on and make the best out of it, you got this"
IM SO HAPPY YOU'RE ALIVE!
"I read your post last night, and am so relieved to see you are alive and healing. You’re a brave mother fucker, OP!! ❤️"
One hour till surgery. Wish you the best possible outcome.

A group of rats is a mischief!
"Energy can’t be created nor destroyed, it’s consumed by bugs and fungus lol. And than that energy is made into fertilizer, which feeds more etc. that’s where I think that phrase comes in. I don’t think it means “consciousness is energy so it transfers”. Consciousness is a byproduct of our prefrontal cortex. It’s a product, it’s not the source of “energy” as the brain generates it.  So that energy, is consumed and than turned into energy for whatever chooses to feast on us 6ft under. That’s what I think that means lol. Sounds morbid but it makes the most sense to me."
"i am so glad to see the update. happy to still have you here, friend!!"
You got this bro ! Thank you for update ! Take care of you !
Congrats bro!! Here's to an awesome life 🍺!!
"I realize that I forgot to clarify that part but was tired and going to sleep. But yes, I meant after they’ve recovered from the surgery. Maybe like 6 months after surgery"
"I’d think anesthesia wouldn’t even take the case on, they’d nope right the F out of the room"
"I meant for him to do it 6 months or so after his surgery. Not for him to do it right now. And this work for most diseases, like diabetes and others but of course most people don’t believe this and can’t stand going without food and water for even 1 day likewise 3."
Praying for you mate 💪
"Came back just to see, so happy for you dog"

"But you literally remember now, right now. Life isn’t a dream you’re thinking back on. Well, it could be, but we see no evidence to suggest it is."
Did u die?
"He has deleted his thread about it. It was in his prior posts from over a year ago, same title and all but he was 17 in that one.  It's a karma whoring post."

"Yoooo congratulations, hope you can recover and finally enjoy life better now."
"I can say that I’m definitely an open minded skeptic… whenever friend of mine want to show my films of ghosts they took on their phone I’ll always watch and ask questions.   If I heard of a medium that was really good, didn’t try to exploit others emotionally with their information, and didn’t seek to profit with their gift I wouldn’t be completely opposed to it."
He lives!
Yahoo!  I’m so glad you did not die. PrAying  for the pain to subside and for the surgery to help.    Keep fighting for as long as you can!  God bless you!

"So happy for your second update, I’ve been checking this post every couple hours. Recovery is a bitch but you made it this far you can do it!!!!"
HE LIVED! YEAAAAA
Congrats on being alive buddy.  Was thinking of you :)
HE LIVESSSSSSSS
You mad lad
"“I LIVED, BITCH”  I’m so happy you’re making a recovery!!!"
HE SURVIVED! FUCKIN GG BRO!
Are you alive?
YYEEEAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
Congrats on having survived!
"OP, I have to say to you how strong and level headed you are.  I understand what you're saying about being able to accept death as your fate, and not wanting to tamper with it through suicide.  Being able to accept when death knocks on your door is when we are truly at peace with our lives, and can actually live. Usually that only happens in old age.   I would like to share one of my favourite passages from one of my favourite books, ""Life's search for Meaning"" by Viktor Frankl with you:  &gt;A rich and mighty Persian once walked in his garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death, who had threatened him. He begged his master to give him the fastest horse so that he could make haste and flee to Tehran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented and the servant galloped off on the horse. On returning to the house the master himself met Death, and questioned him, “Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?” “I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Tehran,” said Death.  This is a condensed version. It's better in the book, but TLDR; for Reddit.  If you're interested, you can get the PDF for the book here:  [https://www.pdfdrive.com/mans-search-for-meaning-e188905816.html](https://www.pdfdrive.com/mans-search-for-meaning-e188905816.html)   If you're bored with nothing to do while you recover. :)"
LETSSSS GOOOOOO
No worries brother.
"LET’S FUCKING GO :)) I WAS WAITING FOR THE GOOD NEWS SO BAD You did it, my man!"
Let's goo congrats
YES KING!! YOU ARE PRO  i wish you a strong recovery &lt;3
"It’s not up to me to make you like it, it’s still the truth"
I had no further operations because other tumors do not impact normal life much. I still have couple that are relatively big but i can just live with them. They just stayed the same after i stopped growing.

"Everything will be fine. If it is exactly the same disease, it is not a neverending struggle. They stop growing, you get all the problematic ones removed and just live :) Surgeries are always scary but i am sure in couple of days you will be all good :)"
Remindme! 1 week
I’m so happy that you’re here warrior &lt;3
Happy for you dude
Congrats Bro!
Good your still alive!
NICE! CONGRATS. Glad your still alive.
HELL YEAH LETS GO BUDDY!!!!! Prayer warriors doing the damn thing too! Keep fighting friend! ❤️
Hey I'm so glad you made it man!
Hi dude. I told ya you would make it.   Proud of you. Thanks for the update
Ayyyyy lesss gooooo
You are truly inspiring! I’m in awe of your strength and general outlook. My daughter went through a 14 year period of just not knowing what was wrong with her they constantly told us it was nothing and was just in her head. She suffered more from that than anything else but finally when we were seriously at our limit like an angle Dr. Green at UAB  said he was not going to release her until he found out what was wrong and what was causing her pain. And he actually did. She had a rare form of chrones that affect other organs as well and she had had pancreatitis and gallbladder problems inflamed spleen and lungs. Because of the wonderful team there she was able to get the help she needed finally!!  My point is when things seem there most dire that’s when miracles do happen medical progress has came so far.I don’t know anything about your medical condition but there is hope if your strong enough to have faith. I will pray for you and send you loving positive thoughts. Your in my prayers!!! Good luck and I’m proud of you!
I’m so happy for you! Good luck with your recovery!
"I’ve never jumped on reddit after waking up quicker in my life. I’m glad you’re still with us OP. Wishing you all the best with your recovery, now go and kick some ass!"
RemindMe!

I've read your post yesterday and really hoped you'll make it. Welcome back in the world :) keep fighting kiddo.
lol. not messing with you but i had taken my sleep aid prescription and was extremely groggy.
He does care if he wakes up. I think he really wants to be alive but he is at peace with the fact that this procedure might result in him not. It’s not that he’s suicidal it’s that it’s worth it to him.
Thank you for saying what I was thinking
"Great,your over that part.Here's to a speedy recovery!😘💓"
He's alive
"Let’s goooo!!!! I’ve never followed up on a post to get updates before. So happy to see you’re in recovery, my dude. Sending you joy and well wishes 🤘🏽"

"Pain is just weakness leaving the body. You got this young blood.  You’re very mature for your age. You have mad courage and I give you props. You’re a lot stronger than I probably would have been at your age. My brain would have probably shut down at these thoughts.  Don’t ever give up though. Always keep pushing yourself. You’ll overcome this and carry on to do great things with your life, guaranteed."

"Idk? Personally I believe in what i see or experience   I saw the thread 14 yrs wow! I thought my boy was 14  mom died 7mos before , then to me at 14, I wasn't out of control, on my own. Kind words I never heard much  I feel stronger better when I show or help a stranger  in a spot,  That I can't trust anything anyone   Is why I came back"
Lmao all you're doing is calling names and being toxic. Every reply I've had is contextual and has a point. Gg

"I’m so glad you made it, how was the feeling heading up to going under? Any regrets and other thoughts? If you don’t feel like sharing I totally understand."
"I was pretty calm when I went into the operating room. As said in the post, I had come to terms with all the possibilities. Also, I got laughing gas for a while befpre I fell asleep. Very nice feeling lol.  I didn't really have any regrets. I also didn't think much lol. I do remember humming Sabaton's 'To Hell and Back' when I was going under tho lmao."
Love you brother. Stay in the fight with us.
I'm so glad to check this post today and find you are in recovery from surgery.  It really made my night.  Wishing you a speedy recovery.

"Ur alive buddy? Hell ya! Even tho I lost the Deadpool bet, other than that I’m stoked!"
You made it! Do you know how its affected you yet?
"Well, recovery pain is still a pain, but hopefully after this surgery, I can walk and breathe normally again."
"If that's what gets you through the day, go for it, but show me proof of one soul.  Not a story, but proof that someone who has died had a soul, and that it is still around ""eternal"".   Once a person dies, the only thing that remains are the memories the person's friends and family have. Once the friends and family members are gone, and once they are no longer recognized in photos and memories no longer exist, the person no longer exists. If you have had accomplishments in your lifetime, the story of you might last longer because of articles written about you, but it's not even memories anymore, just a story.   It's OK. Nothing lives forever. You're born, you live, you die. Period. It's not sad, it's not disheartening. Make your own heaven on earth now, because there really is NOTHING else after your last breath."
"In response to the update: ALL RIGHT, LET’S GOOOOO!!!!🎉🎉"
"Brian Blessed: ""CaptAndrew12's ALIIIIIIIVE!"""

You're one badass mf!
"I saved this post to see the update, I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. CONGRATS MAAAN, TRULY HAPPY FOR YOU!"
"Just wanted to let you know that there is zero wrong with feeling how you do, modern medicine creates a lot of folks like this and I'm one of them. I'm much older than you and have different conditions, been sick for ten years, JFC enough already. My wife hates the zombie I've become, honestly don't blame her, thank God my youngest child still likes having me in her life but she'll be gone in a few years, what then? Is there any point in existing if I can't even go grocery shopping or play a freaking video game for more than a few minutes without getting dizzy and disoriented?I'm no suicidal but absolutely if there was a surgery with a 20% chance of killing me but a 50% chance of making things better, I wouldn't think twice. Glad you made it out the other side!"
"SO FUCKING GLAD YOU LIVED. YOU'RE AMAZING, OP!"
"Damn,boy I'm so happy.....my next free award is going to you!"
Well done op proud of u for sticking through it
"Omfg u may not believe me but I've known him since he was 7 and he's the sweetest person ever  He cherishes his friends and family a lot and tried to spend as much time with them before his surgery(me included)  He just wanted to get something off his chest to ease the mental turmoil of being put through a life or death circumstance  Anyone else who agrees with this douche, please shut up because you know NOTHING."
So you were worried you’re gonna die from a knee surgery? If I didn’t know better I would’ve thought you were having a heart transplant
Why don't you experience the same constant pain then. Don't be shy. :)
It's real 😐😐
Yepp
Yes he did!!
Woooo!!!! Dude!! You made it! Walk to your future best thread I ever seen. So wholesome!!!

"Congrats! This is amazing news, friend. I'll be praying for a speedy recovery and that you can learn a life without pain like you described"
Thank you homie. I appreciate it. I'm so glad to still be alive.
Ty internet stranger. ❤
Ok sound good. But need to remove them again from time to time i guess
"I've been checking a couple times a day, hoping for an update! Woohoo!"
"On my part, living with this disease has been pretty much normal except at your age.  I had three major surgeries (2 on tibia and knee to prevent nerve injury), but after recovery, life has been going on pretty well. I ended up having testis cancer and diagnosed with something called Lynch Disease, but I don't think there is any direct relationship with MHE. I ended up working in healthcare and I'm finishing a PhD.   I wish you good luck and wish you well :)"
"Just want to state that my yay was for OP’s survival, not having the illness."
Happy you are alive! Wishing you a speedy recovery and hopefully this surgery alleviates your pain!
You made it OP!! I'm so happy!! You fought and conquered that disease 💪☺️
Yessss! I was hoping to see this! You got this! Keep us updated on the recovery process. &lt;3
"SOOOOO HAPPY TO SEE YOUR EDIT 2 😮😃 !!! I came back to this, praying and hoping you'd come through. Bless you. I hope your recovery is even easier."
LETS FUCKING GO YOU MADE IT MAN!
You absolute bad ass!  Remind me to buy you a round of drinks in 7 years or whatever the amount of years left until you can legally drink wherever you are
Oh my god so happy to see you're alive. Please give us more updates. You'll live a long and amazing healthy life!
I CAME BACK FOR AM UPDATE AND I’M NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! YAY OP! 🥰💕
"Congratulations, you deserve a long, happy, HEALTHY life. You did it. I’m so happy for you. You really inspired me. 💞"
Yo how’s it going
Congratulations on being alive! (I couldn't think of a better way to phrase it)
I'm not so dumb as to believe an obvious troll who wishes they were black lol go write your manifesto gringo
Congrats on being alive Op!
Thanks for sharing. We're interested in  doing in doing an interview/story youtube video about you. Let me know if that's of interest!  &amp;#x200B;  and GLAD to hear that you're ok!!!
I’ve been thinking about this since you posted. Your edit made my day. I hope your recovery goes well and that you’re able to live a better life ❤️
"You're 14, you have so much to live for. I hope you find something worth living for my man!"
coming back to see that second edit makes me so fuckin happy
Weird u have a brand new reddit. As if he told u to hop on and defend his case. Either way he shouldn't have been online his last couple of hours. No one gives a fuck more about him then his family. He's should've spent every waking moment with them. No excuse for this nonsense
You don't need to be a professional to type correctly
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! Obviously it’s not going to be painless right away but I’m super excited for you!
So glad you’re out and fine. Wishing only the very best for you
Good news of the day and I don’t even know you. Good luck with life!
"My god man, this hurts to hear, I can't believe how much of a crapshoot this life is. We're all born either lucky or saddled with ailments. It's not fair but it's amazing to witness the strength and honesty it breeds in people. I'm sorry man, I hope this surgery turns out OK."
Glad you’re alive mate
"Dude you're 14 years old??? You sound so matured and smart, don't let your affliction get you down. You're probably gonna do great things one day, if your attitude with this much bullshit in your life, as a FOURTEEN year old boy, is anything to go off of. When I was 14 my biggest worry was getting bullied at school. Lame crushes on girls 4 years older than me. Stupid shit that doesn't matter at the end of the day, and definitely didn't by the time I was out of HS. I'm 21 now, 22 next month. Beat the fuck outta these bone tumors."
Hey whatever floats your boat but I will say one life of praise and worship and faith is worth forever goodness. May the Lord bless you and have a great day
HUGE W LES GOOOOOOO
Nicely done :)
Yayyyy this is the best edit ever! Im so happy for you. I learned how to use a remind me bot for the first time for you!!
"I've been hoping to hear updates about your surgery. I'm so happy to hear this, I needed some good news today. Ovbiously the pain would suck rn but you're here, that's what matters.      Hopefully once you've recovered things are gonna start changing for you. I'm really happy you've come out alright. Just rest up, you deserve it!"
GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE!!!!
"I'm a pretty tough guy. Almost 30, already a leukemia (APL) survivor. I know bone pain and how it feels to lose mobility. The drugs they gave me made my bones feel like they were on fire, because I had arsenic trioxide being drip fed to me, and I was just too tired and and in too much pain to walk. This post brought me to tears. Both with sad sympathy and pure joy that you're alive. You're far too young to go through this. I was young too, but I'd made it to my 20s at least. I hope that one day you can live without or at least with less pain like I'm gratefully lucky enough to enjoy. I'm so glad you're alive, stranger."
This shit is as wholesome as Mr. Rodgers feeding his fish.
Spent ages trying to find this post again just to check if you were okay. Good news! Stay safe and strong ✌️
Best edit 2 ever!
Congrats! Glad you’re doing okay and on the road to recovery!
"I created an account to see his Reddit post's comments (since he shared it with me) and saw your comment so I defended him on MY OWN ACCORD. And yes people do give a shit about him -- I included. He spent lots of time with them for sure, and what's wrong with spending some time online? And also, there's no excuse for this disgusting post when you have never known him in person. Nice try."
Why would a white guy want to lose his white privilege?
"YESSS I BELEIVED IT CONGRATS GUY, KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THE BEST ONWARD THIS POINT❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"From one dude with a rare condition to another dude with a rare condition... despite the pain, the odds, the suggestions, the will, the circumstances, all I can tell you is never give up. I was told when I was 17, 4 months from graduating High School, that I would be in a coffin in a week. On the 7th day all of my symptoms went silent. I woke up like a normal (but very weak from atrophy) kid, again. Things flair from time to time, but every day I wake up is a miracle and my life is amazing despite living just above the poverty line. I have the chance, every day, to love people and be loved by people.   Never surrender. Tomorrow is, has been, and always will be worth waking up for. Be well."
So young and so brave! I hope you have a speedy recovery!
Whats wrong with with spending time online during your possible last few hours of life?? And it's disgusting to tell him to get off the internet and go spend time with his family? You're a fucking idiot 100%
"Just here to say I saved this post, and seeing the second edit is so good to see  You are amazing. Stay strong. Life before death!"
I have this as well and my daughter has them she is 20. But hasn’t had any removed yet I have had many removed. Get well.. crazy to see more people who have these.. thank you for your post and what state are you I. Cause I was told there isn’t much study in the area of Texas I live in.. just wondering if others had this problem
Omg so glad you made it through and are in recovery! You're so strong. Let us know how your recovery is going ❤️
I am so happy you Oki.
I’m so happy to hear you are ok! I couldn’t find the post and I’ve been thinking about you! You are one brave mother bleeper. So proud and impressed with you. Stay strong!
Glad to hear you are ok
woo hoo! glad to hear you’re okay
"Hey, thank you for talking about your field.   I'm studying biomedical engineering right now, with about 2 years to finish it. I live in Argentina but I want to move to another country. The way you speak about the money makes it seem to me that you are from the US. Would you have any thoughts on my position? Is moving to the US, or another first world country, a likely possibility in our field?"
"Anywhere with a solid biotech/pharmaceutical presence is like a good bet. I know that Germany and much of Europe has decent bme positions, but it will obviously vary country to country"
Did you end up getting metal ribs?
Thank you. I will continue to research about it. Getting the papers approved over there is no easy task it seems.
"This is the internet, there's no such thing here lmao you must be in the slow classes too"
"I read all this days after you posted it all. An emotional rollcoaster in less than sixty seconds.   ""Is this guy gonna die?  Oh there's already edits, say he's in recovery how nice for him"" glad I didn't have to wait for the answer lol goodluck."
"Well your opinion is nothing but negative, and if its true this post was written by a genuine 14 year old in this situation, then you're being negative towards someone who really doesn't need the negativity atm.   But if you want to treat everyone on the internet like they arent real people, that's fine I guess. It just makes you an asshole when you're wrong. Personally I'd rather give people the benefit of the doubt, as it costs me nothing if I'm wrong."
"My brother was writing at a university level by the time he was 14. He is 29 now and he would make a terrible doctor, but when it comes to writing, he is nothing short of genius. Kids can be whip smart, even without the “PHD” in their name. Being a doctor does not equal good writer, and good writer does not equal doctor. It also doesn’t take an actual genius to write as well as OP does at 14."
I had saved this post to revisit it and check for the positive update. I’m so happy for you man. LFG!
Congrats on living. I wish you a speedy recovery and the ability to walk and live a life with less pain!
Ty (:
Wellllllll I'll make an exception this time. Truly hope OP is doing well
Wellllllll I'll make an exception this time. Truly hope OP is doing well
".. I didn’t say you did.  I’m saying that to me it’s suspicious this person writes and punctuates (note I didn’t say “type” which means something else) better than some people I work day in and out with who are creating business proposals, SBARs, protocols, policies and procedures that are high level and for mass adoption - meaning the author knows will be scrutinized and thus are more cognizant of their writing."
"Good for your brother. And no, it doesn’t take a genius. But does it make me doubtful and does it remind me of all those other writing projects people post? Definitely. And I think, think maybe,  having a PHD in English might make you good at writing."
Came back to check at least twice a day after you posted this. I’m so happy for you and am glad that your recovering!
"Hey OP, thought about this post today and came to see how you were doing. Glad to see the edit, man."
"Glad you alive, OP. Be brave and strong forever."
So like are you gonna be fully okay?

"I’m revisiting this thread… I miss my dad so much. He passed in 2014.   I miss him so so much… he was my dad and my best friend. Always had a safe place to go in him when the world would flip top side on me.   Now when going through it, I am reminded of how he used to ground me and sometimes it makes me breakdown. How I long to have one more hug… one more conversation.  I ought to visit one, your post is compelling. And I’ll always miss my dad. Till the day I fucking die. I’ll never forget our struggles and trials and tribulations we went through together as our family schismed."
if you haven't yet you need to research RSO (Rick Simpson Oil)  https://loudcloudhealth.com/resources/what-is-rso/  theuniversalantidote.com/  Cancertreatmentsresearch.com/fenbendazole
Absolute legend
Youre saying theres no such thing as white privilege
Hope u good homie.
"People are downvoting you as if death was horrible, it's not, your consciousness isn't an ""on/off"" thing. You're not even conscious of your hair growing, your heart beating, the blood cells fighting... Yet you are conscious of that because you are doing it. You're doing the whole universe. I think of death as letting go of ""this"" consciousness"
EDIT 2....             :')
Hallelujah on the update! Hope all is going well!
"Doubt you’ll ever read this comment but...   In our society death is one of those taboos that’s there but kind of like a shadow.   It’s not spoken of in Western societies typically except at the moment of death. But this is really unfortunate because we all die. We all have to face it, so really it only makes sense that you would prepare for it.   There’s nothing wrong with contemplating that you might die or having an idea of how you want to go. Honestly we need to contemplate it more.   Regardless of how close someone is or how likely one is to die at any moment, talk to your family.   Figure out how you want to be distributed. Set up your will, decide what happens to your stuff.   Planning a funeral now is stress free but will be so much harder for the family when that time comes and they have to acknowledge you’re gone. Things can proceed and the family knows they did everything they could and that you would be satisfied."
God will determine your destiny. I am so sorry to hear the struggle you are going through. I don’t subscribe to any formal religion or church but I live my life to serve the god of MY understanding. You have one too. We all do. Speak to him. He is always listening
Yessss. I came back and saw the good news. Glad to hear that the surgery went well! :)

"Christ brother.  14 and already been through this shit?  Work hard. Don't aim low. If you ever feel that you can't be what you want to be, reflect on what you've already been. Never give up.  It'll take work,  hard work but if anybody has done it. If all those who have done it before you have done it. Then why the flying f$%# can't you? You've got a bright future ahead kid. Go get it"
"Hey buddy. Read your post, just wanna say I'm thinking of ya and really really wishing you a speedy recovery &amp; a happy healthy life. Best wishes.  :)"

"HALLELUJAH YOU'RE ALIVE. Happy for you, very much"
Glad you're ok. I hope you make a full recovery and are enjoying your favorite activity soon. Stay strong my young friend.
"God i'm so Happy to see edit. Congratulations Bro, you're a true Warrior❤️"
Probably the most articulate well rounded 14 year old I’ve ever heard from. I hope you do good in this world.
Keep fighting and sending positive vibes your way!
Keep kicking ass OP!!!!
It’s so good that I checked your page and saw that you are alive
I have a shark puppet
I am a grown ass woman and I do not have the level of courage that this 14 year old boy has.  My daughter is 14 and if these words came from her mouth I think I would have a nervous breakdown.
Good luck. The odds are in your favor if that makes you feel better
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! YOU CAN TAKE ON THE WORLD!!!! 😭
"I've been comfortable with my inevitable death for a long time. I've lost track many many times Ive come so close to it. There is nothing wrong with not fearing your mortality, if anything for some of us, it provides comfort. Good luck on your surgery and I hope it works out for you"
"I got shot when I was 24 went to the emergency and I wasn't afraid knowing I could die so I know how u feel , like they say ""todos vamos a morir"" we r all gonna die so stay strong big homie."
"I’m glad your okay. Since you’re still alive, do you have any ambitions?"
We love you
That’s some deep thoughts that you had. Accepting your fate. You experienced the most human experience you could ever imagine.  People forget that we ain’t shit.  I’m grateful you made it and hope only the best for you.  Maybe you continue to thrive and enjoy life 😊
You got this 💪🏼
See you in 7 hours! You got this!!
"This was 2 weeks ago lol. No worries, I'm still alive and doing well. I'll probably post an update tmr or the day after."
"Holy shit I just went through so many emotions, seeing your first post, your following post, and then no posts for fourteen days, I'm so happy that you're alive stranger, I've just been given a rough estimate of how long I have left and it's not good."
Hey my phone decided to give me a notification about this post 17 days after you made it and HELL YEAH DUDE IM SO GLAD YOU SURVIVED!! ARE YOU HEALING ALRIGHT?!?
Yep! The healing process is much faster than I thought it would be. I'm feeling a lot better now.
Best of luck to you my young friend!!
"The main question here is: have you accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior over your life? Have you sought forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ who died on a cross so those sins could be forgiven and that God (who is a loving Father) could give you the gift of grace and heaven? Jesus arose from the grave to give each person hope and He loves you as a brother and wants to be your friend. He wants you to be in heaven with Him, the Father, and many others."
Nice larp
"I’m so happy you pulled through! I’ve been through some painful surgeries myself, I pray for a speedy recovery 💕"
The only way to not be afraid is to believe on Jesus Christ
"i’m sorry you have to live like this and i know this was 18 days ago and that you thankfully survived!  but remember in the future that nobody has the right to tell you how to feel!! I recently heard a comforting thought about death, before you’re born you’re in your mothers womb and that’s the only world you would ever know (if fetuses were able to have thoughts lol), but then you get pushed into this world and meet and love all different people and have experiences you could never imagine and when you die the same thing could happen like maybe we get pushed into another world that we can’t possibly imagine maybe we’ll meet and love beings there too. My greatest fear in death is that there is nothing and i know i won’t care if there’s nothing because i’ll be dead but it’s a crazy thought, to imagine life might amount to nothing in the end. But i think there has to be something, the universe is too big and unknown for there not to be.   Anyways accepting death in a situation like that is probably good for you mentally anyways, because it would be unavoidable for death to be a possibility because either you suffer in pain for the remainder of your life or you risk it and get the surgery? And making yourself have anxiety about death being the risk is just not beneficial for you."
"I’m glad you made it, OP. Best of luck to ya"
Here’s to hoping shit changes for the better now 🍺 also do yourself a favor and have a cold one with your dad.
LESSSGOOOOO
Your courage is an inspiration.  You’ve got this.
"I only saw this after your 2nd edit, but wanted to say your attitude seems completely healthy to me, and i hope you have a good recovery and that your life improves."
I love that edit 2 ... it put a huge smile on my face and I chuckled by myself. What a wonderful spirit you have. Thanks for making me smile  :)
"Puts things in perspective. I don’t know you and I don’t know if anyone has told you today but I love you. We never know when our card is gonna get pulled. Your brave, braver then me. Fight the good fight. Fight till the last fucking breath."
Hi check his account now.
Oh wow who would've guessed
the second update made me smile so much. good for you OP. wishing you a speedy recovery!
Hope all is as well as can be expected. Please post an update.
"Awesome to hear edit 2! Hang in there. I recently suffered from nerve pain and have significantly reduced blood flow in my legs (lack of circulation - &gt; damage) and it was absolutely hell for months. The pain that utterly defies anything to alleviate. I was amazed at how much people can get used to a very constant level of pain. When ""I'm doing well"" means it only hurts normally.  Ive been giving better and can't imagine going through that at 14 let alone what you are. You're definitely an incredibly strong person. And while misguided, your friends comments are really about them and a good sign. They aren't alright with having you gone and acceptance is hard to understand for those who haven't.  I wish you a speedy recovery!"
"Nice goin’!  As someone who is immunocompromised. Asthma, the works. Sometimes I wonder why biology/nature does shit like this to us humans? Is it just like stuff not connecting, have too much/less of something, not enough resources to go around in there??"
"Hell yeah man!!! And death is a natural thing. It's ok to be afraid of it. That's what makes us human! But it's also ok to not be afraid and to find comfort in a peaceful death from surgery or sleep. I have suicidal thoughts at times unfortunately. So I'm not really afraid of death necessarily but I'm afraid to off myself. But seeing ppl that have died brings back trauma from my dad's death so there's that. But seeing an animal die makes me sad but I can mentally handle it. Which is important bc I'm going to be a Vet tech so I need to be ok and not cry every time a pet is put down. But animals don't fear death! They don't like being chased and they're intimidated by their predators but Dr. Jan Pol said they aren't truly afraid. Death is a natural thing and it can be a beautiful thing. I think everyone wants control over their own death. Most ppl want to go in their sleep, I'm one of them, and some ppl like my sister want to go out in a crazy explosion or get eaten by a shark or something! I'm so glad that you made it thru tho! You can be an inspiration and a teacher to us all! Only if that is your choice! Or you can keep living the life you've been given and try to help ppl whenever you can! Sorry for the story lol! Your awesome!"
These comments are restoring my faith in humanity! They are bringing tears to my eyes! You are such a strong person! You are a badass!
"I got to see this after your update. Dude, you have it rough but I'm beyond glad you're in recovery! I have my own personal relationship with pain after a injury in the AF. I live with permanently messed up nerves. So I truly at least get a slight understanding of that pain, and I want to say don't give up. My DMs are open if you need to vent to an internet stranger you will never meet to get it off your chest. Us perpetual pain peeps gotta help each other out."
Hell yeah! Lesssgoooo!
"May St Luke Patron of Heaers, pray for you."
"You got this, fates on your recovery and fortune 🙂"
You still with us?
Yes comrade. Healing well.
Sending speedy recovery your way and lots of positive vibes bro. You got this! Keep us posted whenever you can. Much love and respect for your bravery.
"You have no idea how much seeing your post on tomc and then coming here to see your recent comments being mere minutes ago made my night. Hope recovery went well, and I wish you even more years of life."
How are you??!
Wtf
Let’s go OP!
"As a Marine who spent a year in Fallujah, let me welcome you to the club. Embracing your own mortality is a liberating thing. The cognitive space and function that was spent on worrying makes for a unique perspective on life that only a few know. Glad to hear you made it, and yes recovery is a bitch. Therapy is close to being one of the hardest things to do in life. Put everything you can into it and enjoy some family time. Keep tackling every day as you have been.  Semper Fi young one.."
SO GLAD YOU’RE OKAY!!!
Buddy was soooo out of line.. wtf
Let's go mate! Best of luck to you!
Good luck man. You're strong 💪
"Happy to see you survived. Hope you have a speedy recovery, bro"
God bless you you're in my prayers xx
You good?
Huzzah!! He lives!!
"Just wanna say this post made me tear up. You’re a survivor. You risked your life for a chance to improve your condition because you didn’t want to stay stuck in the same place. When I was 17 I was in a similar spot as you, but my afflictions were mental. I’d made a stupid choice that ended up frying my brain for a while. I was driven to madness and then extreme dissociation to the point where I couldn’t speak, walk, or process information properly and I started to become hopeless because I thought I would remain in that state forever. I recovered, due partly to miraculous luck, but if there’d been a high risk high reward medical procedure for me back then, if 17 year old me had the chance to make the choice you did for a chance to restore my sanity and life, I most likely would’ve been too scared to do it. I would’nt have had the conviction to go all or nothing even if I knew I had a fairly good chance of surviving. You took a huge leap and made it to the other side. I wish you a speedy recovery and I hope that someday, when you’re living the life you could only dream about during the hospital days, you look back on that leap you took into uncertainty and tear up with pride and bliss. You let fate decide, and it looks like fate wanted you to have a second chance"
Your amazing! I literally cheered in my room after reading that 2nd EDIT 💪💪❤️❤️🌹🌹 STAY STRONG !!
Hoping for a quick recovery!
Hoping for a quick recovery!
Sending you hugs💙
I respect you for this! A lot!
"Actually had to go into your profile and as it was loading I was begging it was going well, happy it did. Hopefully it heals well and that you continue becoming more healthy as time goes on, hopefully you will be able to walk now too, if not already?"
"Same here. So wonderful op is alive and well, healing."
Congratulations on the surgery! Took matters into your own hands and I hope it continues to work out for the best for you.
Happy you made it through! I hope you heal fast and have much more comfortable life!
Hang in there friend. Glad things went well. Hoping you get to feeling better
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Glad you’re ok my bud. Need some happiness in this day and age. You brought a smile to my face tonight
I’m so glad you made it through surgery—I saw this late but still am hoping it was more successful than expected!  At least the mandatory hall-walks may be better than they’d been. 😉

God be like: _Nah my homie still needs to live crazy ass shit_ xD
"Man do you know Jesus? I'm not trying to be inconsiderate, I'm truly asking."
God was with you in that moment I will pray and hope your recovery goes good
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
LFG my dude !!!!! Let us know how your recovery and (hopefully) improvement goes
Congratulations
Keep crushing life bro!!
"This world was corrupted kid. Be the light.  I feel sorry for all the kids today. Most of them didn’t have the right nutrients growing up, or too many pesticides for a long life.  God can enlarge your days."
"I hope the operation went well, keep on living 🤍 don't know you but love you"
So glad youre still here!!!!!! Sending virtual hugs!!!!
"This guy is the biggest gangster on reddit right now, respect bro you won that shit"
It sounds like you've been living in agony for a good portion of your life if you were 14 So where your head at is very understandable.  Your friend loves you and doesn't want you to go that is also understandable.  I wish you nothing more than peace and relief from agony.
God bless
We love you.
Im sure you won't see this but I am thrilled you made it young dude. Stay positive no matter what ups and downs come your way. Your a strong dude never forget it
Thank you so much.
"They’re 14, they don’t get what you go through"
"I'm so happy to know that you're alive, stranger! I guess, in the end, nobody is an island, and the bell tools for me"
WOOOO STILL ALIVE
"I’m floored, I’ve never heard of this disease and I’m not at all surprised it exists. The best to you and yours. I hope your life is livable at the very least because there is a lot of beauty to experience. I grieve for your experience in this world."
I love. U
I AGREE BORTHA
Player 1 used healing position. Player one health is replenish
There is nothing wrong with feeling okay about dying. It might seem wrong to some people but that is because they have a hard time understanding it. When you are constantly suffering and going through surgeries it gets hard. To be honest it is a sucky way to have to live and nobody in the world should have to go through it. I want to let you know that you are an amazing person and you definitely are strong.   I am not great when it comes to talking at all so I do apologize if this all sounds awful. Just know it is only normal to feel okay about dying. It can also go other ways by other people being okay about you dying or them parsley wanting you to die. No this is not a bad thing. I have a friend who had her 12th surgery this week. She has a lot going wrong with her body and she has suffered for a long time. I sometimes cry and hope she will die and no I don't want her to actually die I just want her suffering and pain to go away and jt is the only way.  People will want the best for someone they care about. It can be hard to admit this to themselves when it gets to that point but I hope it makes sense. But if you ever just want someone to talk to I don't mind talking. I love listening to other people's problems and it can help them mentally.  I do not know the outcome you are wishing for the most. But I do wish you the best and I hope things go well for you. I give you all the luck I have for the next 7 hours or so. Have a lovely night
Life is always worth it man. Your struggle might be the reason someone else decides to keep fighting.
Glad you are alive bro. 🙏🏾
lfgooooo!!! ✨✨✨
"I never met you a day in my life, I’m not sure I’ve ever posted a Reddit comment. I just felt the need to tell you how proud I am of your bravery and toughness and how happy I am for you if this surgery works. We constantly bitch about work, and money, and small first world problems daily, and then I read this and realize there are people like you that deal with actual problems and have to fight for it. I wish you the best and I want to read updates about your recovery. Whether you get the results you’re looking for or not, you should be proud to know you’ve touched everyone readying about you and have the power to put our everyday lives back into perspective. Thank you and keep fighting man!"
Thank you for your story.  There were a few points that stuck with me.  I very much applaud your courage.  Im inspired by that and given strength today.
It's in the title bro
You don't how to read?
"""Who said that?"" Is there a hidden meaning? A hidden letter I have to uncover?"
"By this word, it mean that i never said that i would laugh if  he die"
"Good luck! I would tell you to stay strong, but you’re so strong already."
"You speak wonderfully  Full of emotion &amp; care  I wish for you, your friend, op &amp; all others in pain   To find ease, relief from their pain &amp; suffering Joy in their everyday   Sending you strength, love &amp; comfort for your heart"
Fight with everything in you. I truly hope and wish for the best for you. Stay positive and strong.
"The edits and finding out you made it warmed my heart! I don’t think it’s wrong for you not to be afraid or care, you’ve lived with the disease and this potential of loosing your life so you have had more time to think about it and come to terms with such a real and raw situation. I just want to say you are so damn brave and strong, 14 years old and look at you go &amp; you continue to keep going! You should be proud &amp; I’m praying for you to be able to live a life without pain and finally have some peace so you can move forward. “Kia Kaha” (this means “stand strong” in Māori. We say it to the people going through hardship or those who cannot see the other side or someone struggling in any area of life) KIA KAHA my dude 💪"
Just saw this  I'm so happy you're alive hopefully you'll feel better
"This is insane, your awesome"
Your a soldier of the struggle fight through it and be strong 💪 these trials will only make or break you it’s up for you to choose which path this will lead you and by the seems of it your winning. Good luck on the rest of your journey you have my blessings.
are you okay bro?????
"You deserve a boy scouts badge for not only spitting in the face of death, but kicking him right in the disco stick as well."
"I've felt the ""eh I guess it's my time"" feeling too. Not from physical pain but pretty much my entire life collapsed, was stuck with an abusive asshat and then for the first time leaving the house in years a car drives across the street right before the MC I was riding on and hit it right on. Right before the impact the last thing I felt was peace, a feeling of acceptance and closed my eyes. Ended up with some bruises, cuts and not much more. But I really felt ok with death in that moment. Not suicidal, but content and just so very tired of the shit luck I had for to long. So glad you made it man and hope you luck turns as well ❤️"
JFC you are one tough MF
⭐️🕊🙏🏾
"Glad you are well. If you are not saved, I pray for salvation for you:  Rom 10:8  But what does it say? ""THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach):     Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.     Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.     Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, ""WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.""     Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.     Rom 10:13  For ""WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."""
Glad your okay. God bless brother.
This kid is a scammer. Check post history. Do not feed into him
The kid is a scammer. Check post hx
I cried when i read the edit 2. Im happy you are still alive!
Bless you and everything you do. Seriously thank you for being alive and for having a good head on your shoulders
"I have degenerative disc disease. Currently have ""something"" (likely residual disc from a laminectomy) encroaching on nerves if I move in a certain way. It's like someone stabbing me in my lower back. But. I can deal with it. Before the laminectomy, I felt the same as you. The herniated disc was pressing on my sciatic nerve making it impossible to sit upright without excruciating pain. I could only stand upright (painfully) or lie flat and was on 24/7 narcotic pain meds. I was ready to die because I couldn't live. I couldnt care for my children or home or work. No one knows what constant, debilitating pain is like, until they know. I wish it on no one. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly."
That’s awesome your alive gps bless
"I love this poem, its quoted in one of my favourite books"
"Dang, younger ppl are so much better at handling this mortality struggle"
"Hi, I also have MHE (much more mildly, though my bone spurs as I tend to call them do create dislocations). Good to hear you have come through your surgery and good luck in future. My aunt and father had many surgeries for MHE and both are fairly physically well in their sixties today. I had my last new growth when I was around eleven. Hormones tend to make the tumors grow so it’s possible when you stop growing you will also stop getting new growths."
@op update ?
"I've been waiting too, hope they're alright. 😟"
It'll work.  Your odds are much better than survivng a day in a Chicago ghetto.   Have a complete and speedy recovery!!!!

Glad you made it through. God bless you brother
I commend you OP. So happy for you
"damn, you got this.  Stand firm, stand strong.  Admiral Hackett out."
"I'm sorry for your pain, but glad you're alive. Best wishes, good thoughts, and healing prayers sent your way."
"I am so glad that you are okay. You're so strong for your age and I hope you continue to keep that strength as you go about your journey with your condition. It's okay to be okay with the thought of dying, especially with what you've got going on."
"You have always been loved, You are loved, and You will always be loved."
Thank you for posting this for OP and the rest of us to read. ❤️🙌🙏💪
"I had a 15 percent chance of surviving my surgery. For a cranial hematoma. Was in a logging accident. Blood clot size of my fist pushing against my brain. I had to learn to walk again, to eat and to speak. I lived. And you will too."

"I'm so incredibly proud of you,, if you wanna stay alive and experience your life here, you'll find a way,, there were a few months where i was at 7-10 pain nonstop and I thought I'd give up but, I'm still here. I support you in anything and I'm so proud of you"
"Wethersfield it be physical or emotional,,, we can find a way even if we really think we won't"
"slightly related,, I have a HUGE fear of my body falling apart slowly while I'm still alive,, teeth falling out, joint conditions getting worse,, etc. there's such fear and pain in this form of existence"
"Your story has really humbled me. I'm currently recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery and it's been one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome. I've had alot of highs and lows and seeing you pull through and do something as crazy as this has made me truly inspired and humbled to think that if you, a 14 year old boy can overcome something as difficult as this, then I (19M) too can easily overcome something as small as ACL surgery. DM me, I'd like to talk more about your surgery and recovery times and things like that"
Best of luck my friend. Positive mindset yields positive results. 🙏 God Bless.
You’re amazing.
Congrats!
How I wish I'm as strong as you.
You’re alive!
Glad you're still with us!
I hope you recover man! You're brave!
HAHAHAHAHHAHHA
Way to go!!! I hope the best for you!!!
"You're a real badass, you know that? Here's looking at you."
"seriously screw your ""friends"" for telling you your feelings are wrong.  I think youre a gangsta, and congratulations on the successful surgery!"
You are fucking amazing
You are fucking amazing
"Hey man, just seen your reply, I feel the exact same about my dad, I lost my dad in 2009 and lost my mom in 2013, I only went to see a medium once before my mom passed away but have considered going again just haven’t, I don’t know if I ever will again or not tbh but that one time made such a huge difference for my whole family, I know for sure there are fake ones out there and for all I know they all could be fake but fake or not the difference it made for us was money well spent, for the record I personally 100% believe this lady I saw was not fake at all!! I break down pretty regularly about my parents man so don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s perfectly normal and is just an indication of the love you had and still have for your dad, the way you described your dad and family and story might aswell have been me writing it, keep strong bro, just know you were lucky to have a loving parent like that, many people never get to experience that, even tho we both lost them young, we still had it and still today know what it feels like 👊🏼"
"Yeah I 100% understand that, I’ve only ever seen one and that was in 2009 in Ireland, I wouldn’t even know where to start to try to find a ‘good’ one tbh, also I live in Australia now"
"I wish people used some common sense before replying to this thread, yea the kid had to have an operation but the operation is no different than having to open someone up to fix a broken bone basically, they are not cancerous tumours there was next to zero chance of dying, he absolutely was looking for attention, and before you give out to me I had this exact operation 8 years ago, so him accepting the fact the he might have died that day, you had the same chance of dying that day, as did every other healthy person in the world"
"The point he was making was the kid had basically 0% chance of dying from this procedure!! I had the same procedure 8 years ago, not once was I told there was a 20% chance of death lol, unfortunately he was chasing some attention and boy did he get it lol"
Thank God for your life...
Glad to hear you’re doing ok!
Prayers
:) I’m proud of you dude :)
"Ayo 😳 he hecked into the system and changed the ""success_rate"" to 100% 😳  Anyways it's good to hear that everything went great :)"
You got this mate👍👍👍👍👍
Wanted to check up on you OP. Hope you’re safe :)
"I am, thank you (:"
Literally just came back to this post to check! Omg
Glad to hear that! :)
Glad to read that you’re okay
You're a fuckin sigma male
What's wrong about being okay with dying? They're in the wrong for being so afraid of it.
"I skipped the age and just read From “have a bone disease”. I thought you were a grown adult! I even thought “why the heck were children crying in the hospital? Shouldn’t they be in different floor” which was when I read your age.  You’re amazing!!! Your struggles will give you a greater appreciation in life and empathy for others, which will make you a better person.  Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor?"
nice! how r u holding up now? i hope ur recovery is swift!
Brave MAN for getting over you fear. You should be proud of yourself.
"I just discovered this and am so happy for you, makes my knee surgery seem  a privilege, Live your life to the fullest my dude!!!"
what a shitty thing your friend said
"Given how you survived I can say this and you might happen to see it. I figured this post was also a better place to say it than the other one. But I feel that exact same way about death. Like if I just die oh well what happens next. It's like a weird mix of morbid curiosity, lack of care, and just boredom, but non of it is suicidal."
Good man.
Glad you're still here with us OP 👊🏿
I have the same condition but the God that mine isnt as bad as that while i do have some lumps many of them have been removed wish u the best brother
Did you make it?
"Yes he did. Check his profile, he’s got posts from a few days ago :)"

"I'm in my mid 30s and I still haven't had a real job besides a 3 months summer job in 2010 and since then I've living rent-free and utilities and food all paid by my parents and sibling who lives with us. But in 2021, my mom passed and she was the most important person in my life so it felt like a piece of my heart was shattered and taken away from me forever. My dad and sibling after my mom's funeral kept telling me to get up and look for a job to keep me busy and not thinking of doing anything stupid or regretful because I've tempted to off my life way back in 2016. As for why I'm not looking for a job? I've been addicted to playing games whole life since the beginning of high school. Ever since then I've spent at least $50k on desktops, laptops, consoles, smartphones, accesories, game memberships, in-game currencies, physical and digital games, etc. Basically I haven't grown up and still have a kid's mentality. Our house is paid off so my dad and sibling wants me to look for a job and just pay the utilities and property taxes and they'll cover the rest. I'm not sure if I have a mental illness or not but I haven't seen a doctor since I was 16 which was almost 20 years ago. I have a driver license but I haven't driven a car since 16. However last week, my dad and sibling threaten to kick me out of the house in 2023 if I don't look for a job and help them out. This stresses me out and I think I'm depressed because of it. I am ready to die and I'm not sure if I will make it in 2023 or 2024 but I'm sure they will be happy that I will forever be gone. I just wanted this off my chest."
"Ayyyeee, congrats on making it!!"
are you in surgery yet
"brass monkey, that funky monkey"
Scrolled down to find this. Hope all is well
"Just checking on the posts I’ve saved here, glad you’re still with us"
Amen
He literally appreciated it tho
Update: he survives
