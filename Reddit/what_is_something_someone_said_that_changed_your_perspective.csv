Is there a compilation of all the quotes or something? :)
This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar
"""A negative thought is a downpayment on disaster.""  From one of the most optimistic and genuine men I've ever known: my Grandfather."
Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?
Just commenting on his because the thread is old but I wanna get a comment in before it's archived.    So...  hi.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."
Thanks for the share. Glad people are still answering and sharing even after this long.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most.

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground.

Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work.

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused.

Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar

Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most.

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground.

Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work.

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused.

Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar

Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most.

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground.

Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work.

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused.

Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar

Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most.

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground.

Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work.

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused.

Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar

Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most.

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground.

Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work.

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused.

Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it.

The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life.

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."

"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

This is a good one if you want to read this 😃😃😃.  /u/Sca4ar

Everything started with one day.
"I've had people say to me:  &gt;""Do you even have *any* muscle on your body?  &gt;""You look like a skeleton.""  etc.  It's been a while since I was underweight. They were hurtful words, sure. But I think I'll take that over being called pudgy or tubby any day."
"""You often find that which you are looking for, when you stop searching for it.""  I was tired of being single following a really bad breakup and my coworker told me this. Really changed how I approach those kinds of things."
And what is the process when you're not happy 80% of the time?

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"
":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"

"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."

Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."

"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Your a genius
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"

"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."
Thanks for the share. Glad people are still answering and sharing even after this long.

"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself.
