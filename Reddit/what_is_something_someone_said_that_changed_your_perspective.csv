"When I was getting annoyed with other drivers one time, a friend got pissed at my bitching and said ""Driving isn't a game."". Since then I've tried to chill out a lot more when I drive and not let other people affect me."
"You can't give a fuck about everything that happens. You have to pick and choose. Make sure you give a fuck when it's most important. Otherwise, keep living life and be happy.   (Translation: getting mad at every little thing will do no good. Only let the most important things rile you up, otherwise let things slide off of you. Like don't get upset when your coupon doesn't work or you're in crazy traffic, cause that little everyday anger shit'll wear you down)"

"It's not specific, but anytime I hear a successful professional/artist/athlete who feels like an impostor or like they won the lottery to get where they're at in life.  It brings home the realization that everyone has the potential to reach new heights and gives me a ""if they can, why can't I?"" mentality that I find very motivating.  To borrow from a successful company's motto, ""Set Goals, Act, Win."""
A social sciences teacher didn't care about the school program so he taught us some basic philosophy theories of some of the most influential philosophers.  Plato's cave story definitely changed my way of thinking. I turned from being a quick judging 15 year who jumps on every hate bandwagon to being more myself and not being afraid of having an opinion that's more different from everyone else in the class.  Not trying to be a /r/iamverysmart person right now.

"I used to work in this mail factory when I was a teenager and, like any teenager, would sometimes frantically struggle to accomplish the most menial of tasks. Enter the quiet, huge gold-chained dude from Trinidad -  ""Look mon, you have to make work easy. All you have to do mon. Just make work easy.""  Really simple and profound advice that has helped me in every job I've ever had. Simplify your task, and you can do it better and faster."

That's really soo good. Thanks for linking to a beautiful thread.
"it wasn't anything inspiring or profound but it was to me  I was fucking up a lot in school, doing drugs and shit, stealing from cars.  One of my teachers who I had befriended over a couple years sat me down and told me:  ""Look, I didn't grow up in a bubble.  I had my fair share of fun and trouble.  You have to realize that the things you do, 20 years from now, you won't remember half of those things if that.  But the things you do CAN and will affect you 20 years from now.""  It made me realize its okay to fuck up and have fun but you have to draw the line somewhere.  Always resonated with me and have passed that same advice along to younger folks"
"I'm just copying from which I remember from how he told it to our class so it won't be exactly precise.  You have 2 man chained to a wall in a cave. They can only look to wards the wall they are facing towards to hence they aren't aware of the other person is in the cave (I don't remember how that's importatnt). On the wall their is something projected. A world with blue grass and a green sky. Women barking and dogs making footstep sounds. A tree with brown leaves, and a gree trunk. Everything is inverted in some way from what it is.  The man sees it for 20 years. After those 20 years he gets loos and gets out the cave to the surface. He sees a blue sky, green grass, a women making footsteps, a dog barking etc etc. He gets confused and goes back to the cave and that's prettty much the end I think.  The moral of the story is that the man wasn't wrong. He had his own reality, and we have our own. Their is no ''right'' reality.   I get from it their is no real solid, truth/reality. Everything is an opinion. I don't apply it to everything because nitpicking everything is just useless. Although I do think this might be an explanation for radical behaviour such as ISIS. They have their own morals and ethics and we shouldn't judge them from our ethics/morals point to explain their behaviour. They aren't sick in their head. Killing for god is the same for them as that we shouldn't kill.   Don't picture me like a ISIS supporter, I just hate everyone calling them psychopahts while that isn't the case I think. Also I'm not trying to a superior intellect so don't post this to /r/iamverysmart."

At the time I was feeling guilty because I was in a patch where I was having a rough time with my job, which is a competitive ""dream job"" so I felt like I didn't have a right to complain and felt guilty for not liking that part of it.

"When I was telling a friend of mine that I have a hard time believing that people can like me, since I don't like myself. She told me ""we don't see you the way you see yourself"". I know that depression alters the way I see the world, and that I see myself not as I should, but hearing that from someone else that actually cares about me really made it real. It's my go to quote now when I struggle. It made me realize that sometimes I just need to change my perspective.   Sorry for rambling so much. I never know how to stop, or put anything into words."
"My uncle sat down with me one day and said that ""you only get one shot at life, there's no way of knowing if this or that decision would take you through a route you'd enjoy more, you can't load up your life from a point and try different things. The place you're right now is both the best and the worst place, it's you who decides and makes if it's more one than another""."
"My old biology teacher told me ""Don't judge a book by its cover, but be careful about the library it's in"".   Basically a good judge of character is the people the other person hangs out with. Still get to know them, hence the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" bit, but at the same time watch out for the social habits they have. If they hang around shitty people and do shitty things maybe they aren't the best fit for you"

"Makes me think of one of the reasons I stopped going to church youth groups when I was younger. The youth leader tried explaining that the Christian God/religion were the only true beliefs, which is why we must convert them to the ""right"" side. So I tried pointing out that every other religion thinks the same thing... And that was not the right answer.   Another parallel- people in first world countries think that women in third world countries (namely middle eastern countries) are being horribly repressed and mistreated. But when you think of it how they do- it's simply a way of life. They don't want anything else because it's what every woman around them knows and has done for all of their lives. So while it's true that they are rather oppressed, it isn't true that they're all dying to get away from it, because that's the culture they were brought up in."
"My dad once asked me what i thought he'd be more disappointed about, smoking or cheating on a test.  I'd never smoked, but I was definitely guilty of glancing at the person's paper next to me. ""Smoking.""  I'd always heard the ""don't do drugs"" speech.  My dad just shook his head, ""One of those things is bad for your body. The other is bad for your soul.  Your soul is more important.""  I dunno why that got to me, but it did.  Edit: dear God, a lot of y'all redditors are mean as fuck. I'm officially initiated into reddit!"
"This is more of a conversation that a simple sentence. But, I have been all around the world and visited many countries and like to think I am a very open minded person. But this one encounter changed my perspective more than anything. I was on a greyhound going from Little Rock, Arkansas to Los Angeles which is about a 3 day trip. Sitting next to me and my brother was a HUGE like 7 foot tall black guy(now mind you I'm 6'4 and 190lbs and my brother is 6'6 240lbs so this guy was a giant. Anyway he was dressed head to toe in Red ... red sweatsuit, red nikes, red hat, red backpack the works. The first day we didn't really talk and we were just wary of the scary gangster giant next to us. Then we started talking to him and he seemed pretty cool. He told us he was from Birmingham and was a blood (obviously) he said he was going to visit his dad when he got out of prison. Overall though not a bad guy. Well we stopped at a rest stop for everyone to get some food and drink and me and my brother grab a bottle of whiskey. After about 4 hours of sharing this bottle with the guy, he all of a sudden starts talking about the devil. He opens his backpack and pulls out this huge leatherbound book filled with latin. I am not joking. This guy starts reading us all of these spells and telling us how he worships dark forces and believes that is the key to life. He starts drawing all sorts of incantations and diagrams in his notebook and trying to teach us some of his spells. This continued for like 16 hours until we reached LA. It was beyond fucking surreal. We got to LA and he asked if we wanted to go to the prison to see his dad with him. We declined and literally turned heel and walked the other way into the city without a clue as to where we were headed.              ANYWAY, moral of the story is .... everybody on earth is fucking crazy and there is no way of knowing this until they show it to you. That experience made me realize how strange humanity is."

"*Now I know what you can do*.  I did very well on a difficult test in a difficult class from which I was struggling.  I worked very hard to prepare, and the teacher knew it.    However, when I saw my good grade, I looked up at him and *really* expected him to say ""good job"" or ""way to go"", and when he said what he said, I actually felt angry.  At first.

"""Some doors are closed for a reason.""   Completely changed my life. I used to always be up into everyone's business, inviting them to share, ""do you want to talk about it?"" even pressuring when they didn't feel like it. After all, I believed, if you talk about it, you'll feel better. Truth is, people need to be able to control who they discuss their problems with and choose their own time for if/when they discuss it with others, and the last thing they need is some asshole encouraging them to ""open up."" Get off their backs! If they're not sharing their problems with you, assume there's a damn good reason and let it go. If they need you, they will find you.   (Another truth is, learned this from a psychologist, sometimes people just need to stop talking about their problems and move on with their life. Not everything has closure. You don't make peace with every tragedy. Happiness is not waiting for you *if only* you can come to terms with your childhood or some tragedy. Some mental wounds are like physical wounds. If you keep picking at the scab, it will never heal. Time heals most things, but you have to let it.)"

"The young adult picture novel entitled ""Everyone Poops"" hit me in a way I'm not sure it was supposed to.  The stream-of-consciousness account is essentially a feel-good coming of age story celebrating individual normalcy through defication, and that in itself has its own merit. It was comforting to know that I'm not a weird monster for producing this foul substance and leaving it in a waterchair for the house to dispose of as it will.  The message I took away from the work in my mid-teens was not just that everyone poops, but *everyone* poops. Your boss poops. The president poops. James Franco poops. That guy at the bar who's way better at hitting on these girls than you, he poops. Those girls? You can bet your bottom dollar they drop bombs as well.  It became my mantra whenever I didn't feel on par in a conversation, competition, or argument. It humanizes the opponent, takes them down to your level. We're all the same, regardless of how much money, fame, or power we have. At the end of the day, we all squeeze them out.  Everyone, everyone poops."

"This occurred to me in my early 20s (I'm still nauseous that this is a phrase I say now) when I used to get angry reading all of the news headlines out there. Eventually I realized that I have enough crap going on in my immediate life to worry about that it wasn't worth being so stressed about things I couldn't change. I can do my part, but I can't single-handedly make all of the awfulness in the world disappear."
"That's like a really clever two-headed compliment. Either it means you did great and performed outside of the expectations, or it can mean they're disappointed. It all depends on how you perform.  That's a pretty cool quote. I'm going to remember that."

"It was a comment I saw on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. I don't remember it verbatim, but it was something along the lines of how parents raise good children but should instead be raising good adults. The thought blew my mind and really got me thinking.   Let kids be kids. Let them screw up occasionally and let them be sad every now and then. They're only preparing themselves for the real world and will be ready to face it when the time comes. Most parents do a great job raising good children and when those kids grow up, they're clueless how to handle real world problems.  Wish I had a link to the comment to credit the user that posted that comment."

People seem to think that I'm okay with religious zealots and extremists of various types killing and maiming others based on their beliefs. I'm not entirely sure where you're getting this from, but I assure you, it's not the case. Obviously there are people who take shit too seriously and truly believe that they have a right or duty to murder those they do not agree with. Most of these people are classified as *terrorists* or *extremists*, and for a good reason.   My actual point was that, in the comment I replied to, someone called into the radio show and basically said that working with an atheist would be ""dangerous"" for whatever reason simply because he doesn't believe in the same things the caller and preacher believed in. That's the sad part, that he/she automatically labelled the atheist as a liability without even knowing their name."

"My dad told me when I was young ""everyone will always think they had more influence over the person you've become than they actually had.""     I took that phrase to heart and it has turned me into the cynical bastard I am today and on the backside I'm humbled by the thought that most things I do have little impact on most people I know no matter how much I believe I may have changed or influenced them.

"Not giving a fuck about anything is also highly effective. At the very least, recognising that giving a fuck is an evolutionary adaption more concerned with keeping your genes alive than benefitting you as an entity.  When you think about what most people give a fuck about: Keeping their tribe and family healthy and safe; achieving status as a more valuable tribe member; acquiring the healthiest breeding partners; ensuring the fidelity and integrity of those relationships prior to committing to 20 years of raising a child; and s on...  When you realise ego is sort of a trick, or a form of coercion designed to make you compete and breed, you can have a pretty incredible life living somewhere sunny, eating the best of food, and relaxing for most of your life. Safe in the knowledge that any desire to off yourself because you're worthless to the tribe is really a form of meaningless coercion designed to ensure the survival of the tribe via self elimination of unproductive and undesirable elements.  Suicide is playing into a system that never valued you to begin with. Should you find yourself in a position where you cannot satisfy your ego, realise your ego is working for your genes, not you. You can enjoy a life of hedonistic luxury, and take pleasure in rising above the brutal list of checkboxes reproduction has engineered your happiness around   edit: Don't downvote the spellcheck guy, I edited some of the mistakes."
"I tried to read Aristotle's ethics when I was 15. Almost everything went completely over my head, but he has one passage where he likens a man who holds all the right ideals, correct thoughts and virtues but does not act upon them, to a sick man who carefully listens to the doctor but doesn't do any of what he recommends. Then he says ""like the sick man won't be cured, so is the virtuous man not good.""  The distinction between thoughts and actions and the emphasis on the latter with regards to being good, was mind-expanding for me. It think I would have been a very different person had it not been for that moment."

"I don't think it's ever a good idea to judge someone based on their beliefs. I do think that whatever someone believes can have a big impact on the type of person they are, but I think it's best to keep the two separate, or at least focus on the person aspect.

"Bob Ross, when I was still a child.  I was at my grandmother's house, and she had PBS on 24/7. So here I am, 5-7 years old or so, watching this winter painting. Kinda bored. Wish there were some cartoons on.  Then he adds a single tree to his scene. It's a winter scene, so it's barren. And he makes a little comment, something like ""and maybe it's a dead tree. Lots of people don't like adding dead things to their paintings, but death is natural. It's okay.""  I may be vastly misquoting him. I haven't seen this episode since (25+ years).  Point is, I hadn't really been acquainted with death as a concept up to then. Bob Ross was the first one to really talk to me about death.  Now I consider myself a existentialist, and it doesn't really depress me. Death is a thing. Nothing you do is going to matter in 100 years. But it's okay. It's really more about enjoying the life your have than mourning the fact that you're not really anything in the grand scheme of things. And you don't have to make up stories about what happens after to alleviate the fear of being gone. Just... It's okay."

As we were planning this night out he said to me ""what i want to do this night, is stay together all night and whenever one of us gets a feeling that they want to do something we just have to do it. No questions we just do it, and see what happens.""   It hit me that this is what this guy does all the time. If theres something he wants to do or say he just does it. If he wants to like something or wants to wear something he just will, and ever since Ive tried to do the same everything seems just that little bit better.

She kept raving about how special it was that people lived like this for hundreds of years unchanged, and how it would be bad if they disappeared...   Except, I don't believe she could understand their language at all..  And that most of what the tribe actually said was subtitled after the fact... Which left an extraordinary impression on me.   Because when this world travelling privileged woman, asked what things would make their lives easier? /in her head allow them to continue their way of life and traditions...   The people of the tribe unanimously said they wished they were not goat herders, that they would like to be able to read and not be trapped in this way of life like their forefathers and certainly wished not to doom their children to such poverty...   It changed the way I think... The fascination of living off the land is not to be revered as much, and we of the developed world should be more thankful for what we have... That perhaps it is a tragedy that this tribe has existed for so long unchanged and that the real tragedy would be allowing it to continue to exist.   White privileged lady went out to document obscure tribe in effort to capture their unique way off live before it disappeared: I ended up hoping it would disappear sooner."

I was working a retail job, and as a customer was leaving he said, ""Have a day worthy of you."" For him, it was just a way of saying ""have a nice day."" For me, I realized, I was not worthy of having nice days. I used his words to inspire me to become better, so I might have better days."
"Sweden has a neutrality policy, too--they stayed out of WWII."
"I was a loud mouth, edgy teenager. I would just say whatever the hell I wanted to because fuck it and fuck what people think.   My boss, best boss I've ever had in my life - Grocery Store Manager - pulls me aside and says ""Look, you gotta learn to know your audience when you speak"""
"""You're the only person that can make yourself happy."" - My mom.   She told me that over 15 years ago. I still think about it weekly at least."
"When I was 12, I was criticizing someone's project in shop class.  A girl came up to me and told me very calmly ""you're always criticizing people, why are you so mean?"".  It was a very simple thing to say, but it hit me hard while my personality was still developing.  I think her neutral tone was important too.  Something clicked, and I realized she was right - I was kind of an asshole.  It changed the way I behaved forever.  I guarantee she does not remember the exchange, or even me at all.    Sometimes it doesn't have to be something poetically profound, just something true said with honesty at the right time in your life."

No, my son... all that life truly offers is hard parting, day and night! YOLO!"""

"There are two that stand out right now. The first one is that a teacher posted the Shel Silverstein poem The Sidewalk on her door. I saw it many times and then one day while reading it, the meaning actually hit me. I was a confused, emotional 15 year old and the problems in my life were largely of my own doing. It took me a few years to be mature enough to follow it but whenever drama happened to me after that I would examine the situation, see why I found it attractive and figure out what I could learn from it. It helped me through addictions, bad relationships,family problems, everything.  The second is ""there is no try, there is only do"". I found the quote somewhere online and I remember just staring at it. I had been overweight and unhappy at the time and I realized, if you're not actively trying to change something, you're not doing anything at all. Don't make stories about the grand things you're going to do, just start doing them. It became my motto for years and even now when I'm faced with a tough decision I can't seem to figure out, I just do something. It might be the wrong choice but it's better to do something than sit and stew and miss everything. I don't always need to know the whole plan, just simply one foot in front of the other."

"I think it just indicates that they aren't very strong in their beliefs. No matter what you believe, if you know it to be true, why should you fear the beliefs of others?  **EDIT**: A lot of people are taking this out of context. Yes, it's perfectly okay for you to have a reasonable fear of extremists and terrorists. Sure, some beliefs are legitimately dangerous. But in the spirit of the posts I was replying to, it is *not* okay to shun someone or refuse to work alongside them simply because they're conservative, or liberal, or a Christian, or a Muslim, or an Atheist, etc."

"""Talk is cheap"". I've been promised a lot of things in the past and have put all my eggs in the same basket expecting those promises to be fulfilled particularily with work, business partnerships, legal battles and often in friendships which doesn't always come to fruition. A friend of mine told me this when talking about business propositions in a networking environment and to take them with a grain of salt. That quote often pops into my head and now whenever someone tells me they will do something or make an offer I feel that the onus is on me to get it on paper or make them prove that it can and will happen before I agree to it."
"""Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring, cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing"" - Nas   I don't sing, and I've never been surrounded by people who do lots of drugs in a negative way or anything, but something about that really resonated with me regarding the people I spend time with and how they can effect you. It really does make a huge difference.   There are many similar bits of wisdom out there about the company you keep, it's something everyone should be mindful of."

"I've said this before on here: I used to do martial arts and was woefully average in ability, but I've beaten a fair number of far more talented artists because they just didn't put in the practice time.

"I used to get really irritated with young children who cry over every little thing because I thought they were being dramatic and stupid. But then I heard a comedian explain that when kids are young, anything less than good that happens to them is ""literally the worst thing that's ever happened to them so far,"" it helped me understand them. And I love sharing that tid-bit with exasperated people trapped near young crying kids, because it always makes them laugh a little and stop being grumpy about it. :)"

"I was going through a deep depression about a year ago, and I was sitting on the patio of a bar in downtown Seattle feeling sorry for myself getting wasted. This older homeless man comes up to me and I dismissed him before he even  opened his mouth. He ignored me and said in the deepest Russian accent ""why you no smile? I lose my wife, my three sons, my home and money. But I smile, because I won't give life the satisfaction of knowing it beat me"".   I finished my drink, went home, and pondered it all night. I now feel that way about everything that gets me down. It's not worth it to get upset, and I won't let life beat me."

"""Does it really matter?""  My good friend said this to me when he told me he was gay and my reaction, was ""oh, really?"" The tone I conveyed wasn't positive. The question made me really think about the situation.   To preface my reaction, I grew up in a time and place (Christian high school) when being gay was heavily frowned upon. He told me while we were in college.  My reaction after this question ""no, it doesn't."" The way I viewed people's personal life styles completely changed after being asked this question. I'm honestly a better person for it and I've thanked him for asking the question - so happy to have changed my views on the subject."

"Skinny hate happens a lot more openly and is a lot more accepted. It's bullshit. I used to be an average person at 5' 9"" and 155lbs. I loved my body and my looks and people respected me for who I was in addition to my appearance. I ended up developing numerous digestive disorders over the years and went down to about 128lbs. People said I never looked better (even though on the inside I was starving to death, malnourished, and wished I could just eat a regular meal again) and I got a lot more compliments from random strangers too. I was content with my looks before this and got plenty of compliments then too, but it just increased tenfold when I lost weight. Eventually though, the skinny-hate started to happen as though I had ""been blessed"" with my figure (which is simply a result of malabsorption) and started getting weird back-handed comments from other women about how they wish they were sick like me. Then it started to become clear that other women didn't want to be nice to me or be friends with me, which kind of sucks because I think a lot of them are more beautiful than me and I feel like I have very few female friends anymore. I'm a substitute teacher while in grad school and now every time I sub at a school, there's at least one teacher who says something along the lines of ""you're so skinny"" and makes passive-aggressive comments about how I don't eat. It's so uninviting and it's honestly started to get to me. I would gladly put on 10lbs just to be seen as a human being again."

Nah that's pretty normal from my experience.  Same thing re: parents.  Often the best thing you can do is lead by example.

"I think it's neat that so many people speak English. I can go to a lot of places in Europe and around the world and as long as I'm in a popular city I can probably get around because most of the younger generations know English. I feel like a jerk for not knowing anyone else's language. I took French in high school and did pretty poorly. I also tried the German course on Duolingo but didn't stick with it.     I work in IT and our help desk is in India. While they can be hard to understand at times and say funny phrases like ""do the needful"" or ""received details via telephonic communication"". I'm impressed as hell that they can discuss some pretty technical stuff in a second language.     Yeah I'll never criticize someone for speaking broken English because I can't speak broken anything. I'll admit too that even though I speak English natively my use of it can be pretty broken at times."

"My buddy Kyle was talking to me about how one of his friends got into the med school he dreams of going to. Kyle said that he felt bad that he didn't do as well as her, but ""That's a personal problem I have to deal with if someone else's happiness makes me sad.""   That really made me change how I think. I've always noticed that when I succeed, it makes others feel bad about themselves. Sometimes when they praise me it's to offset the jealousy they feel. So every time I achieve something or get praised by a peer I feel guilty that I caused others pain and insecurity. But I'd never considered that it's their problem and I shouldn't let it affect my happiness."

"There are two for me:  - Sometimes all a person wants is for you to listen to what they are saying.  I had spent a lot of my teen years arguing with my mom and generally thinking she was so annoying being all up in my business. My senior year I read that from somewhere. The next morning as my mom began to talk I actually listened instead of just zoning out and assuming she was just nagging me. I didn't act like I was annoyed, didn't brush her off, just listened. It was an epiphany, like putting in glasses for the first time and the colors become sharper. I heard what she was saying for the first time because I was actually considering what she was saying. I wasn't angry at her anymore, I realized she was genuinely trying to teach me things and express her own worries.   Ever since then I try to remind myself to listen to what someone is saying no matter how much I think I'm right or know better. This brings me to the second one.  - Never assume you know everything about anything. Whether you have a PhD in it or invented it, there is always something more.  It's like a race, you might get really far ahead in your knowledge about it but when you stop learning about it you stand still. Someone will come up and pass you from behind. I never think a question is wrong to ask no matter how stupid it sounds. A new perspective could lead to a new discovery for anything."

Read this for yourself, and come discuss with me if you think I'm wrong or see it differently."". Really changed how I thought from just listening and accepting what everyone said to questioning things I was told, verifying information, and even seeing if it can be construed another way.

We're in America, a primarily English speaking country. When you seem to struggle at English, I try to switch to a very slow Spanish. Response? They laugh and say ""Haha classic American, can't even pronounce other languages.""   Edit: I deleted the last part about English speakers being the most tolerant.

He asked me how how long I had been in Japan (a little under 2 years then) and then asked the kids how long they had been learning English (6 years or so at that point).  The look of shock on their faces was worth it.    Quite a few of them apologized to me privately later in the day, and one girl said she was happy they finally realized they needed to try harder (she studies English like crazy, and is super nice. We made a deal that I would keep practicing Japanese if she'd keep up with English.)  Edit: derp'd and replied to the wrong comment, sorry!"

"I think it's good for someone to point out how fat you are if you've been overeating for an extended period of time.  Gaining weight doesn't happen overnight. It's insidious. It's gradual and it creeps up on you. You don't really notice it at all and that's what makes it quite scary. I was very slim until my early twenties and then I started to overeat and drink more alcohol (which is packed full of empty calories). Naturally I gained quite a lot of weight as a result.  My mother always told me how skinny I was when I *was* skinny and I thought she was just complimenting me and wanting me to feel good about myself, as mothers tend to do! Like a lot of young women, I was always convinced I was grotesquely overweight even when I was actually slim.  But after a while she changed her tune and started telling me I was gaining weight. She was never mean about it, but she was upfront about it and told me I was getting fat. She knew I would be unhappy with myself if I was fat and didn't want that for me. She just wanted to make me aware of it because weight gain is a slow process that creeps up on you and she knew nobody else would ever have the balls to tell me.  I took her advice on board and lost a good amount of the weight I gained a couple of years later. I could still stand to lose a few pounds, but I'm happy where I am for now. Sometimes it is good for someone to point out your weight, provided it is someone close to you who actually cares about your wellbeing."

I envy that kind of ability to learn languages - I almost wonder if it's more training your brain on how to learn a language, and not a specific one that you learn intuitively when your bilingual. I am struggling picking up a second one, yet my husband, who learned German in school, is having a significantly easier time at it than I am.

"Someone posted this quote about suicide a while back and its along the same line. Not sure the source though  &gt;  Not only is suicide a sin, it is the sin. It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront... The man's crime is different from other crimes -- for it makes even crimes impossible."

"Just as a backstory; I was recently fired from Wal-Mart, the kicker here being that I was pulling a pallet and an associate was pushing from behind that resulted in the pallet losing control and crashing into a glass door and shattering it  Before all this happened I was talking to a co-manager about another manager who had a serious grudge with me. In short he had told me ""never let someone else influence how you act, this job is all based on how you performing. An old store manager told me this every time I would get frustrated at something:   'play the game'.   And for the longest time I didn't know what he meant but then when I did, everything made sense. ""If you treat this job as a game and do your best, than that's all there really is to it."" There are days where I see you busting your ass and I've seen what you can do in a short amount of time. If you show up, do your work, and make sure you're doing it the best you can than there's really nothing you have to worry about when someone tries to question your work ethic.""  When he put it in that perspective, it made question all of my previous jobs.  Had I really let others peoples opinion influence how great of a worker I could've been? There were plenty of times of promotions for me, but I was so worried about how others saw me that I never stopped to think how I saw myself.  I'm looking for a job, been out for about a week or so, but when I do get that job, wether it's part time or full time, even temporary at that I'm going to give it my all because I know my worth and if that company can't see it maybe there's another one that will  It's hard to ignore when someone gives you harsh criticism, but they're just words.

"I'm afraid I may give off the wrong message or offend some people when I say this but this was honestly a big eye opener to the world for me when I was a kid.  When I was sitting in church about 6 years ago, I was about 16 at the time, and my pastor told the crowd ""Gays cannot go to heaven."" He then proceeded to go on a sermon long rant about how homosexuals cannot support a family environment and are doomed to fail as parents. This was shortly after moving to the south from the north. Growing up to the teachings of Christ and that you are to love unconditionally, this shocked me as it was the first sermon I had ever attended with such a negative message.  It didn't make me lose faith but opened my eyes to how far modern Christianity had fallen. Christ teaches love, not hate, and we as humanity have no right to damn people. Christians are suppose to love their neighbor, that means supporting them, not tearing them down."

"I think it's brain damage from my diabetes. It developed around the same time my neuropathy and retinopathy did. Just before that, before I knew I had diabetes, I developed an intense brain fog, and an inability to parse information; I couldn't quickly scroll through a web page, or find something on a supermarket shelf. I Had to be methodical and slow in my approach.  Later, after my diagnosis with diabetes, my b vitamins were found to be low. After fixing my b levels, the brain fog improved, although I notice significant deficits, big examples are malapropisms, especially when typing antonyms, like 'route' or 'root, and my general typing speed and accuracy has went downhill big time.  Everything else is more subtle, except the depersonalisation, which can be accurately described as being in a sort of lucid dream. Obviously, I'm not purely watching myself go through motions, like in a dream, but nor do I have the strong narrative or presence I had before.   It's difficult to describe, because we're so used to being almost front and center of our brains. But dream show us we can perform highly complex behaviours without being directly conscious or aware of them. That's almost always the case. Our brains just disguise it. I think, the slight brain damage incurred by my diabetes and b deficiency likely lead to a breakdown in overall brain region communication; hence the profound inability to scan information, and the requirement to break things which I had historically been capable of doing in a very integrated fashion, into small, manageable pieces. Although that has improved form its extreme, I think permanent damage has been done to the connectivity of my brain. Now, I'm not sure whether it's that things are now less compartmentalised, or more so, as a result. I think it could be a combination of both.  If you meditate, you will realise the little voice in yoru head isn't you. It keep running on even when your consciousness is focused on something else. that's a profound moment if you can achieve it. In itself, it's psychologically depersonalizing. You realise your consciousness is more of an add on than an integral part of the whole process.   Depersonalisation disorder, for me, is like experiencing that all the time; you feel seperated from the processes your brain and body are performing; like an external observer. You're still inside your body, sure. I don't physically see myself in the third person. But it's as close, psychologically, as you can get to that. Things don't directly matter, pain and pleasure become increasingly hypothetical. Something you're aware of, but not really feeling viscerally.   For me, it's definitely a combination of a physical change in the way my brain works, amounting to relatively slight, but complex damage, and the psychological knock on effects.  It varies from person to person, as the diagnosis truly covers a broad range of phenomenon, that approximate to a sort of depersonalised state, from someone simply experiencing a psychological disorder, to someone with dramatic physical damage to their brain, potentially creating an extreme psychotic state, within which any sense of personal identity is lost."

People should be more patient when others are making the effort of speaking the local language. Once I was in a restaurant in Germany and next to me was a women with a little kid.  They didn't speak German and their English was very poor. The waiter didn't had the patient and didn't want to serve them.  I went to that table and spoke with her until I understood what they wanted and asked the waiter to bring ASAP their meal and spoke with the manager. I don't know that women but I was infuriated for how she was treated.

"I have understood this to be a Quote based on Buddhist belief, which is how I will answer your question. In Buddhism, there is a notion of suffering, however it usually differs from our common understanding. Suffering, in this context of losing a pet, might be feeling the pain of the loss with the added pain of; wanting the pain to go away, wishing the pet was still here, blaming oneself or someone else for the loss, etc..   At its very basis, this definition of suffering is simply wanting things to be different than they are.   So when this persons grandmother mentions pain, she means the pain we all feel over loss, but when she mentions suffering she is referring to all the stories we as humans have a tendency to add on to that pain which only serves to lengthen and/or worsen it."

Doubt can be an incredible tool if used in the correct amount. That's why I said keeping an open mind is also important.

Gave up trying to be that person.

A couple years ago I was working my retail job and I was talking with my boss and we got on the subject of gay people. I forget what we were talking about but then I started ranting.   When I was done, ever so calmly, my boss just says, ""Why?""   He wasn't mad, he himself wasn't gay, he was just thoroughly confused. And then it hit me.

"I read a beautiful book recently by Haruki Murakami that commented on the same notion. (I've removed a name in this passage to avoid spoilers.)   &gt; I had learned one thing from Kizuki's death, and I believed that I had made it a part of myself in the form of a philosophy: ""Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life."" By living our lives, we nurture death. True as this might be, it was only one of the truths we had to learn. What I learned from her death was this: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning. Hearing the waves at night, listening to the sound of the wind, day after day I focused on these thoughts of mine.

The father/husband refused the cash, saying in disjointed English ""Today you, tomorrow me"", meaning ""You're in trouble today, but tomorrow I might be. I hope someone will help me the same way I helped you"", which breaks down to ""treat others as you'd like to be treated"", or even simpler, ""karma"".  The storyteller then went on to say that he now never passes someone on the side of the highway, and never takes cash, always telling them ""today you, tomorrow me."""

It's cheating yourself out of becoming better. You're not learning something and taking the shitty way out to try to come out ahead when you don't deserve it. This isn't really a good road. I'm not saying that if you cheated on a 2nd grade spelling test, you'll be fucked for life and are only fit to suck cock for coke money. But if you cheat throughout life, you'll eventually come to find out that those tests weren't just barriers that had to be passed, but they were metrics to tell you if you were on pace to get where you want to be.

"That's not because of talent, it's because of the cumulative amount of practice hours he has. No matter how much you practice now, even if you adopt a practice regime that's more intensive than his, you can never catch up to what Usain Bolt has put into running.   Although pretty much anyone has the potential to become an expert in almost anything, it doesn't mean they can be competitive at the highest level in all types of endeavors. In some types of sports it is possible, but in many it isn't, because they're contingent on other factors as well, like age (Bolt is only 29), and he's spent tens of thousands of hours sprinting. Most of us would be too old to compete by the time we caught up.  But in so many pursuits you don't need to be the best in order to achieve success. You can become an expert writer or musician with less practice than many, and produce incredible/highly-acclaimed work. All this to say, it doesn't take talent, it takes practice -- unless we're talking about the best of the best in time-sensitive activities, where in some cases you need to start practicing really young."

"I agree with this so much. So much ""talent"" is garbage, its someone who practiced like crazy. I use to major in music (dropped out cause of health reasons). If there is one thing I learned its that music at its core is muscle memory and training.  Pick up an instrument, to play it well is simply a matter of learning muscle memory, even singing is just muscle memory. You do the action slowly over time, over and over and over and over and when you can consistently do it at that speed, you speed it up a little bit until its at the speed you want. As long as you keep practing you can do that (short of a physical disability).   Even writting music is just a practiced learned skill, if you get through the first 2 years of a music degree you WILL be able to write something in the style of Bach or other composers of the time, it might not be as complex or interesting, but it will sound like that style.   Practice practice practice, no matter what it is, what skill it is. Practice, get the muscle memory down, and eventually (though it may take a while) you will get it.

Of course the opposite is the problem a lot of atheists have, and I had for a while, as the thinking that the only thing keeping religious people from being immoral jackanapes is their belief.  In most cases that's obviously untrue, and people can be moral or immoral based primarily on their reckoning regardless of religion."

"It was on my way home from a playdate in preschool. The kid's mom was giving me a ride home, and I was strapped in to the seat behind her driver's seat. I watched as she clicked her seatbelt *at the top* and I said ""Your seatbelt is *weeeeeird.* She turned to me and replied ""Maybe *your* seatbelt is weird."" It blew my little 4-year-old mind. Maybe my seatbelt *was* the weird one. How many seatbelts had I seen at that point in my short life? I couldn't be sure that my way was the normal way anymore! People have different thoughts and perspectives and experiences, oh my! The world is so much bigger than just ME!"
"Drugs have been both helpful and destructive in my battle against DP/DR. Sometimes all it would do is confuse  me further, fogging up my mind. But at the right time, with the right people I've had conversations that really grounded me,  made me feel feelings again and given me direction. Especially conversations with old friends on stimulants (cocaine/MDMA) combined with ketamine has allowed me to sync with other people again, pulling me closer to a meaningful reality."
"I usually eat everything that's on my plate in restaurants because I don't like to waste food (doggy bags aren't a thing in my country) The result is that I routinely overeat.  My aunt once said to me ""You know, wether you eat it or you let it go to waste, the end result will be the same : the food will be wasted. The only thing that changes is that you won't feel bloated after.""  I think about it every time I eat out, and I no longer overeat :)"

This. I remember seeing this on reddit a few months ago and it still impresses me every time. I think it is so brcause it goes well with my life philosophy.

"In a lot of ways, giving advice is a means of distancing ourselves from others.

"I'm starting to learn German too, my SO is first generation.  I wanted to do something nice for him.  I'm learning it sure isn't easy,  I sound horrible,  but he's worth it. Also,  gives me a new appreciation for others learning a new language"
"It was a reddit post of a big truck, not a deuce and a half, but the one that's bigger. It was titled 'The owner said to get one, because someday you'll be dead.'  Seems like a pretty good blanket policy."
"I ended up in a situation where I was emotionally abused and manipulated for twenty years by people I depended on. Finally, after I removed myself, I had a lot of undoing and digesting, and I was very broken, not knowing quite how to move on. It changed my outlook in every way when someone finally said, ""They're gone, which means the hardest part is over. They don't have to hurt you anymore. Your only job is to just move on.""  And suddenly I snapped out of feeling sorry for myself by realizing that now that I'm out of that situation, I have full control over whether or not I let their actions continue to cause me damage."
"I am paraphrasing since this was said by a history teacher in my first year of secondary school, but ""Everything that people do is self-centered, even helping others since we think about how we would benefit from providing support to them.""  A pretty obvious fact about human nature, one may think, but at the time, having a teacher make this statement so bluntly and from out of nowhere was somewhat jarring to me at the time, even if I didn't hold it as truth from the time that he said it to the present. It remained in my mind, and when, through my observations of people over time, I gradually came to the conclusion that humanity is kind of horrible, I realized just how right the teacher was."

"My grandfather almost instantly changed a lot of my conservative economic beliefs to be more liberal when he said ""not everybody is as smart as you.""   And it's true. Not everybody can just work hard and go to school and get a degree and get a well paying job. That doesn't mean they should have to try to survive on $7 an hour, and it doesn't mean they should starve in the streets when they don't retire with enough money.  I had the mindset of ""if I can do it, anybody can."" Well, no... somebody with an IQ of 70 simply can't do a lot of what most people can."

"I dunno if I'm weird, but this doesn't make me feel any better at all.  I don't really care of you did it on purpose or if you're not self aware enough to recognise it, it still has the same outcome on me. If anything not noticing you're doing something that upsets others infuriates me more than doing it on purpose, on purpose and there's at least a point to the suffering, ignorance is an extention of how little a person cares about others."

"That mentality brought me from a depressed dude thinking about dropping out of college to someone living in an amazing part of the world with a decent job in an incredibly interesting field, a great, loving gf,and awesome friends. I have kickass hobbies, enough money to buy what I want, and I haven't been bored outside of a few business meetings in years.   I was in a shitty way for quite a while, then I asked myself, ""What have I done in a real sense to make my life better? Why should I believe that tomorrow will be any better than today?""   Well, I didn't have an answer. Not one that didn't seem hollow and shitty. So I cleaned my house. Then and there. Deep clean. The next day, I woke up and thought, ""damn, it's nice to have the house clean!"" Then I rearranged my furniture to be a bit more useful. The next day, I woke up and thought, ""wow, this room is a lot better this way."" Then I started learning new things, actively trying to make friends, starting projects, gaining skills. Every day, I tried to do something to make the next day just a little better. I tried to always have an answer to that question.   Now, I still try to make sure things are improving, but life is so good, I don't actually need little boost to live life. If I get it once a week, I just feel so damn lucky that things worked out as they did."
"""A man that expects nothing is rarely disappointed"""
"When I was 11, in sixth grade, I was walking down the hall at school. I did the thing where you walk to close to someone coming the other way and bump their shoulder with yours. I was such a bad ass.  The janitor, an old black man wearing a dashiki, saw this, shook his head and said to me, ""Hey man, don't be like that.""  Middle school didn't stop being awful and the chip on my shoulder didn't magically go away. It was a turning point though and here 23 years later I still remember him. I wish I could thank him."

I could've caught the one that was due to arrive a few minutes later and still would've been on time for class.  Then that thought started manifesting itself in other areas of my life. There's always another test, it's not the end of the world if I don't pass this one. There's always another boy, I won't die alone if this guy rejects me. There's always another pizza, let this kid have the last slice.  **TL;DR:** a slightly annoyed bus driver made me a more easygoing person."

"I think it's because if you read something written by a native speaker with horrible spelling/grammar, it will sounds mostly correct out loud, it just looks awful, since even uneducated native speakers can (usually) speak perfectly acceptable English but don't know how to correctly translate that into written English.  When someone whose first language isn't English uses incorrect grammar, they make mistakes that a native speaker would never make so if you read it out it still sounds just as wrong as it looks."

"I believe the opposite. Talent makes things ridiculously easy. I've been coaching kids (tabletennis) for a while now and it has made that very clear.      One kid I coached had zero talent at all. He didn't know how to move, he had no feeling for the ball, his anticipation was crap and he couldn't combine movements. He practiced more often and more disciplined than the other kids but always lost without standing any chance.      A kid with some talent and an obsessed father is the second example. He tdained every day, his father bought a roboter and a proper table wizh net about 2000 euro in total). He went to every tournament, every practice camp. He could not have trained more without failing school. He plays on a state level and will never be even close to the top.      Third example, kid started playing at 8, gave up playing at 14.

"I like this because it explains when people talk about those hobbies that people complain about them talking about all the time. ""John started going to the gym and that is all he talks about!""  People only have so many free hours in the week. If they are spending 8 hours a week working out, then more hours and thought process on what they want to do, eat, or change, it takes up a lot of their life. Then of course it is what they talk about a lot.  If you are sleeping 50 hours a week, working another 40, keeping your life going with most of the rest, and doing a hobby 10+ hours a week is a big chunk of that, and there isn't much after that. That is why they will talk about it.  I mean if I like the person, I'm not going to get all bitchy about them talking about the gym, running, diet, job, kids (hell of a lot more than 10 hours), or some stupid drama or relationship issues, because it obviously means a lot to them. If they're always talking about it, they are thinking about it a lot because it is probably the most important, or at least biggest, thing in their life at that given time.  Then on the reverse of ""Everyone is the main character of their life."", I'm probably talking about some dumb shit that someone else doesn't care about because it is important to me, and not necessarily them."

"Had to repost this from an old thread it's too amazing:  When I was 15 years old, I ran away from home because I was pissed off at my parents for a reason I cant remember. I didnt have much money, so I decided to hop onto the skytrain(public transport train in British Columbia) and ride it as far as it would go. I reached the end of the line in less then an hour, and decided I wanted to ride it all the way back again, while trying to formulate some kind of plan of how I wanted to live the rest of my life without my parents or anyone. At the last stop, or the first stop depending on your perspective of it, a girl came on and sat in the row right behind me. I didnt pay much attention to her at first, as I was busy writing my life plan on a napkin. It was a few minutes later that she got up and came sat next to me, curious as to what I was writing. I told her the story, and after a few laughs, we began talking about everything and anything. Her name was Amanda, 17 years old, and absolutely wonderful. She told me she was getting off at the last stop, which was also the first stop, depending on how you look at it. It was also the stop I had gotten on originally, and I told her we would ride to it together. The train ride took less then an hour, and what a wonderful hour indeed.  When the last stop did come, we both knew we probably wouldnt see each other ever again(this was before the days of cellphones, and I was a shy little kid afraid to make moves). As we got to the end of the sidewalk which split in two different directions, she went right and I went left. Before saying goodbye she turned to me and asked me a question that has become a wonderful part of my life; she asked me, “Tell me something you have done, or want to do, that you think I should do? It can be anything, as challenging as you want it to be, or as easy. As long as you give me the rest of my life to complete it, I promise I will do it..” I was confused as to why, but I thought about it, and told her, “Sing a song acapella in a room full of strangers.” She said perfect and asked me if I would like a challenge as well. I told her I did, and she told me, “read, from start to finish, “Ulysses” by James Joyce.” I had never heard of it at the time, but I agreed, and we said our goodbyes.  I have a awful memory, and cant remember most conversations I have with most people. But I remember all of that clearly. You know why? Because of the challenge she gave me. In the 12 years that have past since, I have tried to read that book in over 150 different sittings. Everytime I open my copy of the 780 page monster of a book, I always think of her, and I always think of that day. Ive never been sure if it was her intent or not, but she left her lasting memory on me with that challenge. I soon after learned what she did, was a completey wonderful and amazing thing for me. So I decided to keep it going. Ive met a lot of strangers in my life; some that have become friends, and some, due to living in different time zones and whatnot, didnt. I dont want to just have experiences and then let them go. I want to remember these meetings, and embrace the fact that they happened. So whenever I leave someone who has left an amazing impact of my life, I always make sure to add them to my Ulysses Bucket List. I ask them to give me a challenge, as difficult or as easy as they want it to be, and regardless of the fact that they have done it or not; simply something their heart has had wanted to do.  Some have been easy and fun; I met a man in India 9 years ago who told me to, for a week or a month, cook/buy twice as much food as I intend on eating, and give the other half to a stranger in need. I completed that mission 8 years ago, and thought about that man and the time we had all the way through. I met a girl on a cruise 6 years ago, who told me to jump into a body of water on a slightly cold day, without touching or feeling the temperature of the water first. I did that the very same year. I met a couple at an outdoor music festival a few years ago that told me to wear the most bizarre outfit imaginable and walk through a public place, completely oblivious to the fact that you arent looking normal. I did that task the very next day, at the same festival. Some have been difficult, to say the least: three guys I met in Amsterdam and smoked all night with, told me to go to a mall and give 10 strangers 10 presents. That one took a lot of courage, but I did it a year or so after I met them. It was nerve racking, but at the same time exhilerating leaving my comfort zone. A girl I met on a plane told me to sky dive; Im still in the process of getting that done. A couple I met in Cali on the beach told me to tell the 5 people I hated the most, that I love them and respect them. That one was very difficult because of my stubborness, but ive come close to completing that list many a times(still in the process, 2 more people to go).  And some things, have had an everlasting impact on my daily life. I met a girl at a music festival, who told me that whenever I get mad at someone, walk away, sing my happy song in my head for 5 minutes, go back to the person im mad at with a clam heart and mind, and work things out. Ive made this my way of life. I once met a man at a gym in a hotel I was staying at, that told me “whenever your body and brain tells your that you are exhausted and done…use your heart instead and push out 2 more reps.” Ive made this my motto when working out or working on any kind of extrenuating exercise in which my body demands me to quit. I also use it while working on anything, and while studying. One of the best pieces of advice ive ever received.  There are many others that each brought joy to my life. There are still many tasks I have yet to accomplish, and everytime I think of these tasks, I think of the people that gave them to me. It amazes me how well I remember all these people, while I cant remember so many aspects of even yesterday. These experiences, not only do I take from them a “mission” or a “challenge”, I also take from them a memory of them that never fails to appear inside of my mind. I opened my Ulysses book for probably the 300th time yesterday, and read a few pages, which prompted me to share this story with you today. Im in the final 30 pages of the book, also known as the most dreaded of the read(in the last 40 pages or so, James Joyce doesnt use a single punctuation mark; no periods, no commas, no nothing; a straight 50 page run-on sentence).  I never saw Amanda after that day, nor do I know if she ever did get a chance to sing a song to a room full of strangers. But what I do know, is that she gave me a gift that has never once stopped giving. So wherever you may be, thank you for giving me the Ulysses Bucket List. And I swear i’ll finish it one day. My life advice? Simple: Create your own Ulysses bucket list."

What do you do for a living? I'm blown away everytime I see one of your posts. Just crazy.
"It can be just plain annoying though if the post otherwise has completely correct grammar and just uses one incorrect homophone.  I type really quickly, so even though I know my grammar I can sometimes use the wrong there/their/they're or to/too, because I'm typing almost as quickly as I think and I don't distinguish between them in my head.  Since I see people who otherwise write well often making the same mistakes, I doubt that I'm the only one who does this.  But if I was typing in another language I would definitely appreciate getting corrected.  I'm trying to learn French and I know I'm horrible to the point of being almost incomprehensible, but I don't know specifically what I'm getting wrong."

"I just read slaughterhouse five for the first time. It's often touted as one of the greatest anti war books, but I think the anti war message serves as a frame for the idea of addressing what it means to be proactive towards any kind of goal. Throughout the book death is treated as an occurrence only, and not a tragedy. That war is just a part of the reel of life, and if it upsets you you can always just focus on the happy moments instead. But the best part of the book (I think) is how this philosophy, repeated constantly, can inspire the reader to think the opposite.   At one point the serenity prayer is quoted. The book has been expressing the idea that nothing can be changed, so don't let it bother you. But the prayer made me realize why the book was downplaying the horrors of war as ""just what happens."" When I read the prayer, I focused on how easily it could be used to justify the book's mentality of acceptance and ""inaction."" But I think the real intent is for the prayer to make the reader reject that mentality in favor of the desire to change. Because even though the wisdom to know what can and cannot be changed isn't guaranteed, change is still possible.   Like I said, I *just* read it, so hopefully my thoughts aren't too jumbled."

You know - oddly - I think I had the same realization from watching that same episode of Joy of Painting. As a kid I loved that guy. He was so soft spoken and mellow. I would try to draw the things he was painting - and I remember an episode where he said that. My uncle Don had just died in his 40s and though I did not know him well - it was my first experience with death.    Everyone in my life was very religious so there was always this idea that God is running everything. My thought process was -It made no sense to kill someone early when they were not bad people.  Why would God do it?   Bob Ross's statement made me consider the idea that all of us are just these finite blips. I eventually discovered science and physics. It became clear to me that we are programs that emerge but ultimately end.  But we got to see the show. We got to be a part of this bizarre painting of existence that popped from a quantum blip of immense improbability.   It's cool I got to play this game.  I'm cool with the game eventually ending.

I could sense the hole how the bullet had somehow cauterized every blood vessel but and burned through my brain and I got angry at the person who had moved or whatever and I yelled at him in anger and something about the anger that I was feeling caused my heart rate - blood pressure to rise and that caused all the vessels around my brain to break and blood flowed into my brain andmy vision instantly went incredibly woozy and then I dropped to the floor with blood pouring out my nose and mouth and I could feel myself dying and the last thought in my damaged brain before I went out was that if i just had not gotten angry I would have lived and I died in the dream.  Then I woke up pretty rattled and it was so poignant that to this day when I'm about to get an angry or lose my temper I think about it. I got angry maybe twice since then and this was years ago but that dream comes to mind and it really calms me down a lot."

"Let yourself feel pain when pain is present. But let the pain recede when it inevitably starts to do so naturally. If you can't let go of the pain you will only cause yourself to suffer.

What you can do is understand that the emotions they cause are temporary. By doing so you can let them go when it's time for them to pass."

"My mother told me, apropos of nothing, that I had ruined her life. We were walking on my college campus that I had a full scholarship to and was getting great grades at, and she had driven up one weekend to tell me about her stay in a mental hospital after it had happened. She knew I hated that she dropped these bombs after there was nothing I could do about them. I'd told her this. Naturally, it made her pull that more.   In that moment, I realized that the problem in my life hadn't been me, at any point beyond the normal teenager stupidity. The reason she had screamed at me, chased me around the house, threatened to kill herself every winter and made me talk her out of it, the reason we were homeless, the reason we always got kicked out of places we managed to couch hop to, the reasons we never seemed to be able to hang on to family friends.....   I hadn't ruined her life. How could I have?  That moment is etched into my brain as the moment I realized that my mother was the source of all the outsized strife, pain, and fear in my life. It was the moment I fully understood that what one person saw as the ultimate truth was in another's eyes total nonsense.   After that point, I realized that relying on her was detrimental to both of us. I cut ties. Now, seven years later, I have great friends, an apartment of my own, a reliable job and great coworkers, and am fairly mentally healthy and resilient. I graduated from college and have a pet cat. I live a good and stable life. And it's all because my mother told me I'd ruined hers."

Perfection is boring -Pharrell Williams
"That reminds me of (The Office spoiler) [Andy Bernard's last quote from The Office on the finale. The delivery, the line, and it being the finale made it really tough to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJK4eZgKMd4) I got teary-eyed and even cried at The Office sometimes when I binged it for the first time throughout the last couple of months. Binging is a bit sad for me because you're actually watching these (in most cases) people become friends and have fun together and knowing that the end is coming is just really sad to me. And this quote fit perfectly with how I felt watching the show. And I think it's *such* a good performance because it's actually what Ed Helms felt like in real life. Sort of like the Goodbye Michael episode, that's the most I've ever cried at anything. Movie, video game, show, nothing compares to watching [that scene with Jim and Michael.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF5gk_HPRWc)"
"""The only person you're cheating out is yourself.""   I started wrestling in 7th grade back in the 80's and started out not winning any matches. During workouts, I'd keep telling myself that I had to work hard, because I deserve results. Ended up being a state ranked wrestler, and I honestly think it's due to my effort during the workouts."
Often I wish I documented my first steps when I reach a goal. We then teach others but we never have a complete and honest history of how we got there.
"This reminds me of that first shitty year of wrestling. Most people lose most of their first year matches and get discouraged.   Guys who come back for a second season get better, win more, and gain love for the sport every year."
"With all the examples in your list, those aren't things where I would stop and think about how they think they're the main character. That's just plain being an ass so I would probably fight with them.  What I was thinking was when they tell all these great stories that happened to them but I don't care. That's when I think, ""They just wanna tell something that happened to them. They're the main character of their life and anything great that happens to them they clearly wanna share it. I do it too, but others actually wanna listen. So I'll just force myself and react."""

"""I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom, for me and you. And I honk to myself.. What a wonderful world."" - Louis Armstrong  I was in a pretty bad funk for about 6 or 7 years. I would classify it as depression though I never went to a doctor to be officially diagnosed.   One day this song's lyrics just hit me. Even though I couldn't see the green or the red nor could I see that this is a wonderful world, the song gave me hope. And little by little I started to see the green and I saw the red. This song was my ray of light when all I saw was black and grey.  Having made nearly a complete 180 this song always brings a smile to my face and reminds me that the little issues I have are nothing compared to where I came from. And if I could pull out of that, there's nothing I can't do. Plus, it's just a simple reminder to notice and appreciate the small beauties in life."
"Similarly,  when I've been in that state my boyfriend has said ""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you""."

"That's not a fast metabolism, you are not eating enough. I used to do the same thing, I was really overestimating how many calories food has.

"It might seem dumb, but my therapist taught me to say, ""It's not ok to do that (insert whatever is not ok)."" Or, alternately, ""I'm not ok with that.""  By far, the most powerful phrase I have ever learned. It doesn't threaten, it doesn't intimidate, it doesn't force, it just says, ""I'm here, I'm a person, and I don't consent to be treated like this.""  For someone with serious issues sticking up for herself, it really helped me out."

"It's not that they don't realize it, they just don't think about it. The standard for much of the US is English only and aside from a Spanish 1 class in high school a lot of people don't know the hard work and dedication it takes to become fluent enough in a second language to even survive in another country, let alone have conversations in your second language."
"A co-worker once told me ""The answer is always No, unless it's Yes!"" That has stuck with me for years...you never know unless you ask..you'd be surprised how many things you are afraid to ask because you *think* the person is gonna say no, ends up being just the opposite!"

"I had two university professors make off-hand remarks that changed my perspective.  The first said:  &gt;""Don't be a slave to your appetites.""  Up until then most everyone in my life had lived by the philosophy of ""do whatever makes you happy"" which many people interpret as ""do whatever feels pleasurable in the moment."" They almost take pride in not placing limits on themselves. So, I suppose, that remark made me realize the value of discipline.  The second said, referring to what he sees on campus:  &gt;""I walk around here and all I see is guys with this look on their face like someone owes them something.""  That remark in and of itself isn't particularly profound, but it resonated with me personally because it made me realize that I was probably one of those guys."
Thank you. The wording of the end confused me.

"In Canada, English and French are constitutionally equal, we all learn the other language throughout our entire education. Any French speaking person will at least be able to conduct a business transaction without too much problem, a very good proportion (over 30%) are considered perfectly bilingual, the number is even bigger if you only consider the people under 60. Anybody from anywhere in Canada can go anywhere and speak English to a cashier somewhere and I'd say 99% of the time, they'll be served in English, broken if anything.   Now, try those numbers the other way around, it's laughable, even given the same opportunities to learn. The sad truth is that most people are lazy and, given the chance, they won't do shit. English is usually a language you can speak anywhere, therefore many native speakers won't bother to learn anything else, as where most speakers of any other language will at least learn some English."
"I was in the car riding shotgun while my S.O. is driving, and I had my feet on the dashboard to reach that full extent of relaxation. Now usually her attempt to get my feet off the dash would fail from her reasoning that ""I don't want it to get dirty"".. Then the other day she said ""because what if I were to get into an accident?""  Immediately I thought of the scenario, the carnage that would be my body, all the broken bones from the airbags, basically folding me in half.. Never fucking putting my feet on the dashboard again"

"I get where this is coming from, I truly do. But unfortunately then this gets to work both ways. When parents horde approval because of something they don't like...well that pushes kids away. I don't mean something destructive, just different political, religious beliefs or career path. Again in my experience it becomes much harder on the parents when the relationship falls apart than the child. I mean it is hard for the child too, but nothing like the parents. Idk if my parents get to not like me for dumb stuff well then right back at them. There is plenty of stuff that they have done/believe that I can ""not like but still love them"" for."

"I asked my dad once why he played this overweight kid up front. I wasn't exactly a marathon runner myself, either. He explained ""The big guys, they are the ones who learn the game best. They learn positioning better than the fast guys."" My way of explaining that to people later was ""You see, what speed really gives you is the ability to make up for mistakes or to take advantage of others. When you don't have that speed, you have to know the optimal positioning to outwit the option.""   That went a long way as a coach and as an educator. Only when you are a coach or a tutor do you realize that you will *never* have what most people consider ""ideal"" conditions, and that kind of thinking went a long way."

""That's not what I want.""  ""That's what *everyone* wants.""  ""Not me.""  ""Then what the fuck *do* you want?""   ""I want you to grow up and be happy with what you are.""   First person who'd ever said that to me.  Totally shattered me."
I dont know if that nihilism as much as it is existentialism
"This is... very poignant for me where I am right now. It's beautiful, thank you."
"Definitely not. I've learned both French and German and French is much easier than German. For starters, there are only two genders for nouns, there is no such thing as 'case', the general structure of a sentence is more similar than in German, and there are more words that are the same in both languages. French does have some pretty fucked up verb tenses, but lots of them are rarely used and you can get by just fine without ever learning them."
"That's what I was telling someone before. I'm not really a person to care about what happens in other peoples lives. But usually I sit through it and react because I'll be shown as an asshole for being like, ""I don't care.""  I have friends who talk about the same things all the time, and so do I. So i just be fair and listen to everyone because i know what happened to them is important."
Smoke'm if you got'em.
"I used to be a lot more religious, and I kept kosher as that's how I grew up.  I was in New Orleans with a group of friends and we were at a restaurant that had really good seafood. Our group of friends were all admins on an online game, and the company was paying, so everyone was getting the nice seafood and I ordered an okay steak. The woman next to me (who was actually the game's Producer) asked me why I wasn't getting seafood.  I explained the rules of Kashrut as explained in the Torah, and how things living in the water must have scales and gills so most ""seafood"" fails the test as they have exoskeletons rather than scales.  When I finished my explanation, she said:  ""I didn't ask why jews don't eat seafood. I asked why YOU don't eat seafood""  My only response was ""habit, I guess"" and I realized that I was getting basically no fulfillment of any kind from keeping kosher. Not eating pork or shellfish wasn't making me feel like a better person or making me healthier or anything like that. In fact, I resented it because I love to cook and taste food and I wasn't experiencing everything the world had to offer.  Not long after that I stopped keeping kosher, and started viewing my life as ""Don't care about why OTHER PEOPLE do something, instead focus on why I do something and decide if it is/isn't worth it for ME"""
"Often it's easy to spot someone who is writing in another language compare to someone who is just thick or more often, lazy."
"As a 20 year year old that often takes classes with 30-40 year olds and sometimes people even older, you are more than capable. You might feel out of place, but I know that personally I really appreciate the experiences and conversations you bring to class. You put in a lot more effort and definitely deserve to be there a whole lot more than the immature kids who still treat it like high-school.      I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I prefer taking classes with people older and more mature than myself. It keeps me more focused and engaged. So honestly, thank you. You've probably made much more of a positive difference in others learning experiences, and even lives, than you realize!"

"I've read in several places that English is the only language that is an official language in every one of India's states.  However, India has its own English.  Just as American English and British English differ from each other somewhat, so too does Indian English differ from both of them - and a little more so.  Sometimes when Indians speak what seems like ""bad"" English to us, it's actually good Indian English, it's just not the same as our English."

It's a *long* time -- we're talking a long-term hobby or skill you do/practice regularly, not an obsession that lasted a few months or a week of skiing each winter.

"""You aren't stuck in traffic, you are traffic"".  I was commuting to college at the time.  The drive should have been 45-50 minutes but typically took 2+ hours with rush hour traffic.  It used to always make me really, really mad when I would I sit at stand still.  Then I heard that and realized it's a selfish view-it's not that everyone else is in my way.  We're all in each other's way.  I have no more right to be on the road than anyone else.  Since then I just go zen when I'm in traffic, and I never try to change lanes when one is moving faster. It's really always exactly like that scene in office space where as soon as you change, the lane you were in starts moving faster.  Just chill out and wait and you'll get there at the same time as you would have otherwise.  No need to make yourself extra stressed about it."

Over the last two years, however, I have gained a great support system of people who care about me and want to share my burdens. I thought it was better, until I found myself sharing all and suffering a lot more than I used to. When I share, I often end up focusing on the negative far too long because people want to talk it out. I know that some people need to talk it out, but that's not how I learned to cope. All it does is prevent me from moving on, and create a dependency on others.  Currently trying to find a balance again where I can be healthy both in myself and in my relationships."

"""Never compare your private reality to someone's public persona""  For too long in my life I always felt like everyone had it better than me and I was failing in life where others were getting ahead. For some reason the first time I heard this it all just clicked. You have no idea what is going on behind the scenes in someone's ""perfect life"". That amazing house could be mortgaged to the hilt, those gorgeous cars could be leased, the extravagant lifestyle could be all bought on credit, you never know. I realized that my financially sound and emotionally healthy life may not feel exciting at all times but it is real and it is mine and I don't spend a single day worrying about when the fake show is going to come crashing down around my ears.  It was the most freeing thing I have ever experienced in my life and I pass that lesson on to my children at every opportunity."

"I don't know. It might sound very strange, but I don't believe that talent exists. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like most people who are considered ""talented"" have been practicing whatever it is since they were very very young. Small children are basically able  to do anything, which is exemplified in their ability to acquire any language with about 0 effort. Adults, by contrast, cannot learn new languages as flawlessly (they will always have an accent, or whatever). This example translates to other things, like art, sports and music. Ever seen a child play the violin at master level? Compare them to an adult who has had the same amount of practice as the child.... they are more often not as great. If we want to entertain the thought that talent exists, I think it most likely stems from an individual's experience. That sounds obvious, but what I mean is something like this - Lets say you're the type of person who has grown up working with your hands...  you then enter an art class in high school and demonstrate you're actually good at portraits ... people may then say you have a natural talent, but really, your advanced ability to shade comes from the hand eye coordination you've developed doing something else. I think it's incredibly difficult to make the connection sometimes between what you're good at and what your  experience has been, so people assume it's some magical ability.  I guess I have to tie up some loose ends and say that I  think some children suck at certain things because of mental factors like lack of interest, fear of failing, etc. Also, if you believe in talent, that's totally cool... it kind of relates to Chomsky's nativist theory of language. I don't... I'm more of an empiricist I guess."

"That's annoying.  That is why when I am friends with people and they do socially awkward things, or things that people would find annoying, etc. I point them out.  It was always very awkward and it is a hard thing to do, but good friends will do that for you.  It is funny because it always seemed to be a wakeup call to them, like a bunch of things they would connect for them.  It is like they were blind to them.  I also found the more people had a hard time getting people to hang out with them, the more 'things' like this they exhibited.  If you are serious about having difficulty, I find most people that have this problem are people who are clingy.  Do you have anything 8nteresting going on in your life? Or do you mostly just focus on getting people to hang out with you?"

It was the saddest thing to find out. He remembers holding her in his arms before she passed.  But my best friend absolutely hates people with autism. She has an autistic kid in her class and all she does is complain about him. The saddest part is that the kid knows he has autism and he cries about it.

I can play some pretty nice songs, and I can learn new songs in a short amount of time.   Now, when I play for others I often hear ""you are talented!"". I myself completely disagree. Ive been playing for so long that it would be a talent to not be able to play. I learned slowly, but I've become better and better and now my skills are quite impressive. If a talented player started where I did and put in the same amount of time, that person would be so much better than me.   Talent just seems to take away the impressive amount of time it took to learn something and just assume genetics played a big part. I think talent is a word that shouldn't be thrown around so lightly. Notice the effort it took to get that skill. Know that you could be able to do the same and don't use ""but he's talented"" as an excuse. That's nonsense."

Low blood sugar and nutritional deficiencies that make you feel like shit are a given if you reduce your calorie consumption but don't make sure the nutrition in those calories count.  There can be mental health issues at play.  Food can be a coping mechanism.

"As a fairly private person, who doesn't need to ""talk about it"" all the time, and carefully chooses who she confides in, I second this.   A friend I hardly see had heard that one of my parents was ill and came up to me at a party recently. After the usual niceties, she said ""so is it your dad who's ill?""   I stood there feeling visibly awkward, clearly didn't want to discuss it with her - she had guessed the wrong parent anyway - especially at a party, but she just stood there waiting until I expanded on it. Was angry about it for days. I did not want to open up at that time. If someone doesn't tell you something, and you know there's something wrong, wait until they bring it up. If you really can't help yourself, just say  ""hope you're ok, I'm here if you need to talk"""

"To be fair, living in Japan for two years is a much better teacher than studying English in school for even 6 years. It isn't surprising that your Japanese would be better than their English!  How is your pronunciation now? I have a Japanese exchange student living with me and his English pronunciation is still really bad even after living here for 6 months (and learning English in school for 3 years). I've been learning Japanese for maybe 3 years though (and never been to Japan) and he says my pronunciation is 90% perfect.  Basically we've come to the conclusion that Japanese is a lot easier to learn than English is. Have you had a similar experience?"

"You're not wrong. As a teen, I was incredibly obsessed with Harry Potter and was constantly hanging around Harry Potter forums and chat rooms.   My grade for English shot up around that time, because Harry Potter chat rooms were filled with grammar Nazi nerds who would try to win arguments by attacking your grammar.   So yeah, Internet people being shit to you can help you actually help improve your English.   I used to see people on Reddit correcting language problems all the time. Some of them were mean while others were politely educational.   But these days, I don't see that happen as often anymore. So many ""they're""  and 'their"" mix ups go uncorrected.   It's great that people are being less of a dick when it comes to language use. But I kind of think that people correcting language mistakes politely should stay.   How are people with English as their second language going to learn if they don't ever get corrected? Even native speakers have some issues with grammar.   But it has been a lot of years between my Harry Potter phase and now. I've lost interest.   Which means that my writing has been deteriorating for some time now. Reddit isn't really helping much."

"It's pretty obvious when someone doesn't write well because they're foreign vs uneducated. Someone who grew up speaking English natively will make very different mistakes than someone who learned it in a classroom setting.   For example, I grew up speaking French and English but I've only ever living in English-speaking countries. My reading and writing in French is shit because I write what I hear, but I can make myself understood even though I have a small vocabulary and make a lot of mistakes. My classmates who learned French in school are going to have a much harder time making themselves understood even though they know the rules of language and they are more likely to communicate more respectfully because that's what schools teach.   TL;DR: uneducated speakers are easier to understand but lazy, foreign speakers are hard to understand but have a deeper understanding of the language than a lot of native speakers"

They're also older so companies see them more as a liability than anything as health problems increase with age and you never know what's going to happen with that person in 5-10 years because you know they sure as fuck aren't going to take risks like younger people and potentially switch around jobs.

Im not a jainist monk or a even a vegan or vegetarian, but ive always remembered that, and i remember i didnt kill bugs for fun anymore after that.

Barista: ""So it's gay to enjoy a delicious beverage?""  For some reason, it just kinda hit me that using the word 'gay' in casual language as an insult is not only offensive to people who hear it, but it's also lazy, crude, and boorish. Since that day, I've never used 'gay' as an insult.  Thank you Ms. Random Starbucks barista for correcting my ill-mannered behavior. You truly changed my life."
What is the point in forcing yourself to believe in something? At that point aren't you just lying to yourself?      Why is it so important for you to be Christian if you know you don't believe in it? Do you think it will make you a better person? It doesn't. Are you afraid of dying? Mortality is a beautiful thing.

"Just finished my major in computer science I have learned that majority of the people in my degree were a lot older then I imagined. There was countless people in their late twenties and mid thirties that returned to school to do computer science. Partially why I guess they always offer night course alternatives to most of the courses a lot of people would come after work during the day to do a class at night. At first it surprised me when I realized the person sitting next to me was talking about his kids but throughout the years I realized especially in comp sci it is certainly not uncommon. It's just like when I learned there are usually quite a few senior citizens in my english classes that have said it's a delight to come back to school in their later years just to talk about and do work on books that they love since they didn't get a chance when they were younger. Made me realize that after high school the path can turn into a whole bunch of loops and thats alright.   EDIT: Those seniors certainly made me think about my future after I retire and it not being as depressing as I'd originally thought it would be, especially since you pay next to nothing after a certain age to go back to school here (to encourage seniors to be active and stuff)."

"Aw man, I'm sorry. I had a Yoshi for a couple years. He was a street dog as far as we could tell, yellow pit mix with big ol brown eyes we found at around a couple months old. Super sweet dog but STRONG and wild. My wife at the time became pregnant not too long after we got him. He did pretty well with my son for the most part but still made us nervous because he could be so unpredictable. We thought getting him neutered would help. It didn't. After a few close calls we started looking for a new home for Yoshi. No one wanted him. Too big. No good with kids. No good with cats. Not great with other dogs. Rescues wouldn't take a pit mix.     Finally one day I got the phone call I had been dreading. He had jumped the dog gate and charged down the stairs snapping at my 3 year old niece. Fortunately she wasn't hurt but it was the last straw. I took him to the humane society and they told me with his temperament and history he would not be a candidate for adoption and would be put down immediately. I broke down crying, with this 70 lb dog sitting in my lap, shoving his football sized head under mine, lapping at my tears. I wasn't expecting him to be put down so swiftly and it really caught me off guard. I thought he would at least be tested for temperament first. I wished for some other way. Someone to call in that moment and say they'd take him. No one did. I hugged him tight and told him I loved him and that I was sorry. Then they strapped a muzzle on and walked him through the door.     I still hate myself for not going through that door with him to get the shot. I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't watch the life go out of those big brown eyes.     Sorry for the sad story, just had to get that out."

Our vocabulary is based in Germanic with a heavy Latin-French overlay and tons of minor borrowed terms from everything from Algonquin to Tagalog, but our grammar is heavily modified Germanic with slight Celtic features and a stubborn adherence to Latinesque ""rules"" on top. Nordic and Low German speakers seem to do alright with it (or at least get taught well), but Romance and non-Indo-European language family speakers seem to generally have a tough time of things."

"This has happened to me twice so far. The first time I was very young and it was my first year in kids pitch baseball league. I made the all-star team and we were at our first tournament. I struck out in every at bat in the first game so I was really discouraged.  I was talking to my dad between games and told him I couldn't hit because I wasn't used to seeing different throwing motions and breaking balls. His response (which I'll never forget) was ""well son, all-stars adapt"".  The second time was my freshman year in college and my sociology prof. was leading a class discussion and asked for those that felt that viewpoint A was correct in all cases to raise their hand. I was one of very few people with my hand up and he called on me and said ""why do you believe that?"".   The first quote made me realize that there will always be new challenges and if I wanted to be one of the best at what I was doing I would have to learn to deal with changes and sudden spikes in difficulty.  The second quote made me realize that a lot of my beliefs were based on what I had been told not what I really thought."

I see, and hear about even more often, people who are insensitive and rude to employees of companies (among other examples), and when I think about that now it disappoints me and makes me want that much more to treat others with kindness and respect, because when I do, I have a good day, and I know the other person at least has a good minute or two out of their day."

I've lived by a condensed version o this: do it right or do it twice.
"By ""top 95%"", they probably meant the 95th percentile. It means that 95% of people either meet or are below your level, with only 5% above you.  However, I haven't seen anyone call it the top 95%. Usually when you use ""top"" with a percent it means the highest ranking, so the ""Top 10%"" would be the highest ranking individuals within the first 10% of the sample size.  The 10th percentile would be amongst the lowest ranking, because it means (if you were apart of it) that 10% of people are at or below your level, while 90% are above you.  They mixed them together by mistake, but I'm sure they meant the 95th percentile."

All we can do is try to leave the world a little nicer than we found it, but even that goal can bring a person to despair if they can't make peace with the idea that nature will inevitably reclaim our efforts. It's all temporary, and that's okay."

"""Not everyone is going to like you.""   Mom told me this in 7th grade and she told me how not everyone likes her either. I was shocked because she is nice and not mean and she said parents in our old neighborhood didn't like her because she kept complaining to them about their kids being mean to me and that bothered them to have her keep coming to their house and ringing their doorbell.   So it's true that not everyone is going to like you no matter what kind of person you are. You can be a nice person and still won't be liked or laid back or kept to yourself. So I shouldn't worry if I will be liked or not or even care. If I am not out being mean or bullying anyone or harassing anyone and if I am not out harming anyone, I shouldn't care if I am liked or not or even worry about it. Also people will have their own reasons for not liking you, it could be due to what you like or wear, what you believe in or what your philosophies are, or what car you drive or what you don't like, what your favorite movie is or because you are too quiet or because you don't drink or do drugs or don't know how to solve a math problem in your head or know how to do algebra."

They're adults, but some of them were so insulated from understanding ""the outside world"" (even as anthropologists!) that trying to break them out of that shell was not something I was in a position to do. I'd have grad students repeat to me almost word for word what came from a teacher or book- there was never any reflection or critiquing of what was being said.   I'm not saying I was special or better than them (I worked full time during school, which made me a bit of a leper), but I know more than a few of them hit a hard wall after graduation when suddenly jobs and loans became their new reality. At least one hit it before the next day."

"I was eighteen at the time and I had just finished walking down the aisle of a military chapel in Arizona. I'd just graduated an eight month Intelligence Analyst course. Essentially a crash course in how to do my former job overseas. I prided myself on being the humorist in my class. Always had something to say about everything. I was a bit of a loudmouth, but it consistently got the laughs, so what.  As I approach the back of the chapel, with soldiers trailing behind me ceremoniously, each with their certificates, just like me, I come to a line of instructors; the faces I saw every day, all day, for months. I get about halfway through, and the Staff Sergeant (the only uniformed guy. everyone else was part of a team of intel contractors) who oversaw my course shook my hand. But he didn't let go.  He looked me in the eyes and said, ""Just remember. You're never as funny as you think you are.""  Those words always stuck with me for some reason."

"A friend once pointed out that very often, when somebody is listening during a conversation, they are really only waiting for the right moment to make the conversation about themselves. No matter what the speaker is saying, people actively listen until they have found something about themselves that is somewhat relevant, and then start talking about it the next time the speaker stops for a second. She told me that her goal was to not be friends with people who do this, and it's stuck with me for years now. I find myself about to do this almost every day, and have to stop myself. It's basically the normal pattern of dialogue, and it's horrible."

"I asked my brother to read some of my first writings once.  He asked me, ""why am I reading this? What's the purpose of the story?""  I've always had the reader in mind in all my writings since"
"I think learning about a variety of subjects has helped shore up my blind spots.  - Economics. no brainer. Understand how the economy works. Try to get at least 3 core econ courses under your belt in college: Micro, Macro, and the third:  - Money and banking. I took a good course on coursera. Gets pretty technical but useful to have a big picture understanding of what the heck it is banks do and how they work. - Course I took in college, called ""Relationship between Business and government"". From there I understood how groups with something to gain will invest more into lobbying and fight harder for their agenda, which actually doesn't benefit the majority of the population who doesn't have incentive or awareness to invest time to fight back. Helps you understand politics and the government a lot better, and also useful if you plan on going into business. - Hearing about people's anecdotal experiences with sexuality and gender on reddit. Made me see that gender and sexuality can be a lot more complicated and variable than black and white. This made me more open and accepting of people's sexual and gender choices and preferences. - Seven habits of highly effective people. Taught me about being proactive. As someone who used to be pretty passive, this lesson changed the way I approach things in life. - Bitcoin. I don't mean just learning about the mathematical solution that allows it to work or the technical aspects. I mean the economics, the theory, the philosophy behind it. You learn about economics, currency, government, distributed decision-making, assets, finance, human psychology, the history of economic systems, the history of gold, etc. Bitcoin is such a huge concept to understand because it encompasses so many different fields.. it could be a major in itself possibly. - Hamming's ""Learning to Learn"" lectures. almost too deep for me.. haven't made my way through the whole thing. Pretty good for scientists and engineers though. - Computer Science 101. Finishing just an intro course to understand how programmers begin to make code.. very enlightening. - TRAVEL. key to understanding different cultures, foods, economies, and people, is to go there and experience it firsthand. If you integrate with the local culture as much as you can while you're there, your brain can't help but expand because you'll see that there are different ways of doing things. Imagine you had just one hamburger your whole life. You would begin to think that that hamburger is the only way to have hamburgers. But traveling opens up your imagination because you begin to see that now there are ten hamburgers, hundreds of hamburgers - and all of them work in their own way. Some are better, some are worse than the one you are used to. In the end your mind is opened to new possibilities and is not as rigid anymore. - Successful Business/Entrepreneur/Athlete/Artist/Others' stories. Very useful for cultivating a success mindset. What do they do that's different from others? Useful if you are ambitious. - The Economic crisis of 2008. A must-understand. Take a week to read about this because this recent crisis is really relevant to a lot of decisions being made today. Even if you want to just buy a house, for example, understanding what happened in 2008 can be helpful. - Fitness and Nutrition. Really vital that everyone these days understand how to exercise effectively and how to eat healthy diet. Nutrition alone can take people years to study but to get the basics for losing weight or staying fit you can learn these in a week.  - Watching Star Trek. Seriously this opened my eyes to new possibilities in a way that is hard to explain. You have to read mind-blowing sci-fi to really get it.  I have a lot of blind spots though. right now those are probably, among others:  - Chemistry.   I failed the AP chem in high school. Chemistry, or at least the way it was taught, just never clicked with me. - Physics.  This will be a blind spot until I complete a few physics classes. - Engineering. Just ugh. Eyes glaze over when people get really technical - Construction and building things in general. again.. *yawns - Food. how to cook it, prepare it, the nature of taste, and flavors, how those mix, etc. - Music. I don't understand music theory. I studied violin/viola for many years but I was more of a one-trick pony who could only play those. If you put me on a different instrument or asked me deep music questions I'd crumble from a lack of true knowledge"
"From The Art of War, ch 4  &gt; 1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.   &gt; 2.

"I was guilty of doing this when I was younger despite the fact that I could speak 4 languages myself. I'd make fun of kids with accents because it's just what we did in my house. My parents always had funny accents and my brother and I would just roast them when they just couldn't pronounce the words right. The context then was different than making fun of another person not in on the joke. As an adult I respect the hell out of someone who moved across the world, learned an entirely new language and is surviving or thriving in their new environment."

However, I will sometimes come across people who are obviously ESL (sometimes they admit it, sometimes not), and I'll try to beta for them if they're up for it (and I have the time). I've seen a number grow even just from chapter to chapter in how well they can write on a mechanical level."
"Byron Katie, an author and life guide type of person asked the question ""Is it true"".

The moment as a kid that I realized that not everyone can be perfect, that one has to empathize even with people that one would usually dislike or even disrespect. Many actors are actually victims, most people are lead by emotions, being less intelligent or capable doesnt make you evil, all that can be okay and circumvented. Expecting others to always act perfect and rational is just not realistic or even fair. That game confronted me with incredibly deep topics, and on top of that it was really good and fun."

"Definitely is.   The Foreign Service Institute evaluated the time commitment for an English speaker to learn each one of 62 selected languages. German was a category II language, requiring 750hrs. Only category I languages required a lower time commitment, and there are only 10 category I languages (one being French), so German is effectively 11th out of 62. This means that German is the 11th quickest language for an English speaker to learn out of the 62 selected. I would call that being one of the easiest languages to pick up for English speakers. Just because French is easier doesn't mean German isn't still one of the easiest languages to pick up; those are not mutually exclusive ideas. French and German are two of the easiest languages for an English speaker to pick up. Learning French (600hrs) or German (750hrs) would certainly be considered easier to pick up in comparison to Indonesian (900hrs), Lao (1100hrs), or Korean (2200hrs).

"Mine more applies to stuff like learning how to be good at drawing. You really don't need a lot of shit to be good, you just need to practice, practice, practice, watch other people and try to glean some new techniques of your own. Loved drawing since I was very young, still don't consider myself very good, and whenever I decide ""I'm gonna start trying to teach myself to be better"", it's hard to motivate myself because trying to be better includes trying to learn a few things from people who have already done all that, and when I see what they can do compared to what I can do it just makes me feel pathetic.

Right! I come to really enjoy the phrase.
That's from an Orwell essay called the hanging.
"**tl;dr teacher makes a joke that makes me question my sexuality for years to come and puts me through years of horrible depression.**  To begin, I'm male. Sex was never a concern to me. I never went on any dates or anything. Sure, I had crushes, but it wasn't something that was ever really on my mind.  One day, one of my ""cooler"" teachers mentioned/joked how guys think about sex every 7 seconds (which I know now isn't necessarily true). This concerned me, as I basically never though about sex. Even when masturbating, I wasn't thinking about sex so much as just fantasizing about whatever it was that turned me on at the time.  I began thinking about why I was different. ""Is something wrong with me?"" was a common thought around then. I realized that I never ""checked out"" girls or noticed that someone was ""hot"". In fact, I didn't even know what ""hot"" or ""sexy"" looks like (still don't). I thought maybe I was gay, but I realized I didn't check out guys either. I started trying to force myself to look at women that way, but it felt weird, so maybe I was asexual. I never really had a strong sexual attraction to anyone, so I accepted that for a while.  Throughout those couple of years, my thinking changed a lot (accidentally and intentionally), and I can't explain it completely. At one point I realized I used to thinking about a guy friend back in middle school (years 6-8) and that I would sometimes look on Google for pictures of Naruto and Sasuke naked together. Long story short, now I think I'm probably bi, but I've still never even dated anyone, and I'm too afraid to ever ask anyone out I have a crush on. I go back and forth between extremes of what gender I'm attracted to, so it makes me confused and stressed. But I'm alive, so I'll be fine :)"

"Mozart had no natural talent?  &gt;Mozart was a child prodigy. At the age of three, he was picking out chords on the harpsichord by ear; at four he was playing short pieces, and at five he was composing. He wrote his first symphony in 1764 – he was only eight years old! Starting when he was six, his father Leopold began taking him on concert tours throughout Europe. You get the picture.  That's natural talent that virtually no one else has that he was born with.  I agree that hard work is very important, but the idea that natural talent doesn't exist is just a comforting lie.  I used an extreme example to make the point obvious, but everyone has varying degrees of natural talent that is not just attributed to hidden interests or mental effort."
"I don't think this is an accurate characterization. Kids who are ""good"" by adult standards of children overwhelmingly do better in a variety of ways than kids who acted up.  I think the distinction between the A+ kid and the B+ kid is more telling. An A+ kid (the best by the educational system's standards) is more likely to be a perfectionist, deeply afraid of failure, scared of displeasing anyone, etc. A B+ kid is probably competent in school, but is probably less insecure and obsessive about failure and measuring up against other people, and with a better understanding that they can't please everyone all the time.   The key distinction for me is resilience. A lot of the A+ kids come out a) not knowing what they want for themselves themselves b) scared to go after it when they do, and c) unable to cope if it doesn't work out.   So in that sense, I agree with you, I just think the relevant split isn't over ""good""/""bad"" kids but resilient and non-resilient (and for the record, A+ kids can totally be raised to be resilient)"

"I WISH someone would've been upfront to me, especially when I was in middle/high school. Nobody would. I feel like I would have been more motivated if anybody would have been straight with me. If I asked, I'd get the ""You're growing/it's babyfat/you're just fine"" bullcrap. I knew they were lying, I had shit for self esteem anyways. They should have helped me, since I was 160lbs at 10 years old."

"That's a lot of assumptions. I know quite some 25yos who have shit work ethics and are constantly ""sick"", while my 59yo mother misses a week per year tops. Young people also get pregnant, 40yos don't. And why would older people job hop more, I'd imagine that they would be glad to have a job at all and be *more* loyal than the constantly job hopping 25yos.  And really, painting a *30yo* as a geezer who can't keep up. Ffs."

"""apologizing isn't about admitting you're wrong, it's about acknowledging someone else's feelings."" I can't remember who exactly said it to me but I know it was a friend, when talking about other troubling friendships. it's made me far less stubborn. I also had a good friend make a metaphor using teapots and teacups to describe the appropriate amount of emotional support you should give people and nothing more than that, that I've always remembered. it was something to the effect of ""everyone is a teacup and you shouldn't try to be a teapot just to hold all of the shit your friends want to throw at you. that teacup is for you and your problems and other people's problems as well so don't try to fit a whole teapot of feelings into yourself."""

Think about it hard cause if you'd spent as much  energy and time fixing your life as you do blaming everyone for it, I bet you'd be in a better place. You're such a dumb fuck now. You got potential but you're wasting it. The epitome of wasted potential. The poster child.

Not saying phelps didn't also work crazy hard, he just also got lucky and has the perfect swimmers body making it easier for him to be so great."

"Ten years ago I was walking from the bus stop to my house in a rural area and a homeless man approached me on a bike. He rode beside me for a bit, trying to strike up a conversation.  ""Hey man, nice day isn't it?""  ""This bike is great, it's awesome to not have to walk everywhere""  ""You live around here? Nice part of the country.""  Regular old grumpy/introverted me responded with vague answers and noncommittal noises because I just wanted the guy to leave me alone. He finally took the hint, but as he cycled away he said ""You gotta thaw out that heart of yours, man. Life's not meant to be lived that way.""  That struck me. I've tried to be a more open, friendlier person since then. Thanks Mr. Hobo, who just wanted to talk about the warm weather."

"That isn't very well documented. The best sources trace the quote to the [Mathausen complex](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18913/did-a-jewish-prisoner-write-this-quote-about-god-and-forgiveness), which was an extermination-through-work camp that mostly housed intellectuals who refused to take the oath to Hitler, and later for prisoners of war. Only a minority of prisoners were Jewish. The atheism evident in the quote as well as the well-formed expression of the language might suggest the author was one of the many intellectuals imprisoned by the Reich rather than a Jew questioning his or her faith in extremis.   In any case, there doesn't seem to be any photographic evidence of the quote's actual existence. Despite its power, it may be more urban legend than a fact."

Spanish is easy.  The tricky part comes with all the different locations native speakers learn it.  My wife from Guerro can barely understand someone from Mexico City.

We can communicate it just sounds totally different depending on our accents.
"I was bawling my eyes out at my best friend's wedding, at which I was the maid of honor.  My BIL had been killed by a drunk driver 3 months earlier.  My husband left the wedding because one of the groomsman was joking about drunk driving and just wouldn't stop.    The priest sat me down, and I fell apart.  I thought I should have been over the death by then, but I wasn't.  It consumed me.  He told me that grief is like the ocean.   Sometimes the waves lap at our ankles and we can handle it.  We just keep on walking.  But sometimes those waves knock us over as we keep struggling to stand up.  They don't start out big and then go to small, and stay that way.  Sometimes a big one comes when you least expect it.  It's normal.  Just keep getting up.  Honest to God, it helped me so much.  It's been 8 years and I still struggle with his death, but I know it's ok."
"Related:  ""I don't understand why anyone would think that"" is the *worst* reason to dismiss something.  Ignorance isn't an argument, and you are probably missing something relevant.  Keep doubting yourself until you can honestly say ""I understand why people think that, but it is wrong."""

"Yeah.  People say really competitive people hate to lose, but I don't know how true that is.  The easiest way to avoid losing is to just not playing, or avoiding challenge.

Basically after that and thinking  about the implications, I've stopped making fun of people doing weird stuff so much. weird like people claiming to be otherkin or having harmless delusions.   Stuff like that can help a person find stability without hurting themselves or others, and that it's probably not my place too try and ridicule everyone into being ""normal"" even if it's a really out there delusion.   So yeah now I've really strived to see things from another's perspective even if it's a really out there thing, so long as it isn't something like antivaxxer stuff."

"""If everything or everyone is wrong, it might be you.""  My grandma told me that, and while it's something to take with a grain of salt, it's helped me. If everyone says I did well but I doubt it, then chances are I did well but feel I could do better next time. If everyone says an idea is terrible, then I need to make sure I feel confident in it and test as many angles as possible. It doesn't mean I must fold to all peer pressure, it just means I need to listen when a swarm of people I love and care about disagree with me.  A close second is, ""People give the advice they needed."" This helped a lot in situations where I felt like someone was being condescending or acting like I was stupid. These days, if someone warns me not to do something I imagine everyone knows not to do, I just tell myself that they don't think I'm stupid, chances are *they* did it before."

So, now whenever I meet someone, or even people I already know, I try to think about how they see themselves, what hobbies or skills do they think give them value and importance , which can be especially devastating if one of those things is taken away from them or if someone is better than them at one of those things"

"While there is a huge amount of truth to this, it took me 40 years to really come to grips with the fact that people learn things different ways. And, that music is really only taught in one way. Before I was 20 I went through piano, and several brass instruments tiring of the rote learning of chords and theory that had no practical application in playing the instrument the way I wanted to play it. For a good 10-15 years I just gave up thinking music wasn't for me. But, one day I woke up and realized I had music in me. I just had to find the way to let it out.  The moment I let go of the color-by-numbers approach to music, and felt free to explore music the way I felt it, things really opened up. After 3 years, I still only know the frets of the first string, can only play basic chords, and a very limited background in music theory. But, lay me down a chord progression and I can really lose myself for a good 20 minutes laying down some rhythm and lead. Some guys that I jam with who have been playing for over 20 years keep telling me that I'm progressing at an amazing rate. Truth is I'm not really. I don't have nearly the background they do. But, when I listen to them play it all sounds very rehearsed and rigid. When I'm playing I just put out what I'm feeling. And, if it resonates with me, it resonates with whomever is listening.  The down side is I don't really have a roadmap to follow any more, practice-wise. But, in the past 3 years since I started anew practice doesn't seem like a chore. I look forward to playing, and really only stop because my fingers can't take any more. It's not uncommon for me to practice 2 hours a day, spread out over 4-5 sessions. And, I never feel like I'm out of things to work on.  I'm not claiming to be SRV or Hendrix. But, I enjoy what I do more than ever. Sometimes it's good to take a look at your progress and reevaluate if it's taking you close to the goals *you* have, rather than the goals of the teacher/program."

"There's a difference between bad and evil, but I'll grant you that distinction isn't always made. I'm sure even people who get off on being bad don't think of themselves as bad - they think they're above the system and they're taking what's owed them, and that even if they're hurting people, they have some allowance to do so. There's also something to be said about the correlation of violence with masculinity and strength in a time when public approval of violence is constantly declining, but that's tangential at best.

"I unfortunately do not have the source, but I do have the comment saved in my phone:    Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.  This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.  Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket.""  But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.  He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.  No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was startingi to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.  So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...  But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:  ""Today you.... tomorrow me.""  Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.  In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:  ""Today you.... tomorrow me.""  tl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.  **edit: To the OP, sorry to jack your thread, this has nothing to do with Hitch Hiking. I sort of thought I could just get this off my chest, enjoy the catharsis and watch the story languish at the bottom of the page. Glad people like hearing the tale and I hope it moves you to be more helpful in your day to day. **"

"I was in Year 11 and doing placement work in a garden center, I had little to no aspirations or ideas on what I wanted to do in life. I was nagged at by my school to get an idea on going to college and get some sort of trade since back then I was one of the 'coasters', those who could achieve but were too lazy to reach their predictions.  On this job I met the guy who possibly had the biggest impact on my life called Joe. Joe told me that 'find something you are happy with and stick with it, see were it takes you', this was after being told that 'it takes time to find what you enjoy but when you find it, it clicks inside you, you'll know when it happens'. He ended it on the note that 'if you find something you love doing you wont ever have to work a day in your life'.  At that point I took his words to heart and started to love history, like I had been predicted to do well in math and science as I had achieved good marks, but history I loved doing, I find it more engaging and interesting that crunching equations. Now I'm at university doing history with the tutors who wrote the books I did research on in my A-Levels and I couldn't be happier.  It's odd to think that in one week I had gone from someone with no idea about their future to near concrete on what I wanted to do.

"""Why, indeed, there are many types of people in this world, Madame. We must each be true to ourselves.""  This one came from the TV show *Poirot*. It is a line from Hercule Poirot, played by David Suchet. It doesn't seem like much or one of those amazing quotes in other comments, but it got me thinking. I was raised to be pretty conservative and that's how I was for a few years of my life; I was so judgmental, homophobic sometimes, tried to live by outdated values. Things that happened in my life made me completely rethink many things though.   As Hercule Poirot said, there are many kinds of people. Simply true to themselves. This doesn't mean people can't change their ideas and conceptions, but got me thinking of what kind of person I was being."

That way when it is difficult, you aren't surprised or discouraged and instead prepared.  And in the rare occasion that something is easy when you've expected it to be hard just makes life that much sweeter.""

"In an African Fiction class in college I had a life-changing professor. We were going through the atrocities of colonialism and all of that has been happening to the African people for last few centuries  (I hate to summarize something so complex so simply but bear with me) and a student started speaking about charity- how capitalism really relies on the notion of people giving back. Another student elaborated about the problems with ""charity""- how it's only for the giver, how it automatically subordinates someone, etc etc. all of which the class agreed. This discussion of charity went on for a few minutes amongst the students and finally the professor chimed in:  ""You don't need charity if you fix the system.""  Rekt.

I'm probably getting that wrong somehow, but it seems to arbitrary and ridiculous...though I guess there have been plenty of non-religious ""wars of succession"".   People in the office (that didn't give a shit about PR and neither did we) would call the area between our desks ""the neutral zone"" and/or ""the gaza strip"". I've had people ask me if we fought a lot, and we did...but mostly over which restaurant in town made the best hummus.

In the streets they call him real, coz he only talks real shit. His English speaking puts even the locals to shame, you would think him a scholar. He's highly motivated and very  optimistic, he is Christian and wants to be a preacher and he seems perfect for something along those lines.      Just yesterday I saw him in the streets, and he's the kind of dude that will always take the time to show respect and give you a moment just to say ""hey how are you, what's going on in your world, its good to see you etc.. Before he walks away he turns to me and says.     "" just remember things will always get better because they ain't got no fucking choice.""

"For myself, it wasn't necessarily something someone said, but something I read. I was sitting at a pool relaxing after just moving to Florida from up North. All of the animals and plants were completely new to me. I remember sitting there on the chair, staring out at this small brown lizard that I was watching bop his head up and down. Obviously I had seen reptiles before and was familiar with the behaviour, but I had never lived in a place with wild lizards so I decided to google them. They turned out to be a type of lizard called an anole and this little square space I had seen him run around for the last few hours was his home. Each anole has a couple feet of habitat, complete with a sunbathing spot, a spot to eat, and a spot to watch for predators. How strange to see this tiny, inconsequential creature protecting his tiny square home with every last thing he had. It ended up changing my life and how I thought about animals and people. Every person or animal just wants to be safe, to go to sleep, to wake up and eat. To not feel pain. That's it. We are all the same.   Anyway, I stopped eating animals after that and am completely veg now. Just something I'd never considered. I had always assumed that my feelings and wants were superior, but really, they're the exact same. We're all the exact same.   edit: added a word"

"Had a teacher in my senior year of high school basically tell me to stand up for myself more and believe in myself, essentially appreciating everything about me when it felt like no one did or knew. Sounds cheesy, but I sure was in need of hearing that. It really caught me by surprise how she seemed to see and acknowledge what lied beyond my introverted appearance when I thought she was just one of those cool teachers I liked yet never remembered me, and I admit it did make my eyes water a bit."

The real answer is your total weight is 160 lbs. 150lb body plus 10lb head/brain (whatever the 10lb refers to).  So 1.5lb taco being eaten by a 160lb person would mean the person was now 161.5lb   0.93% Taco (rounded to 2 sf)  EDIT: Significant figures.

"It wasn't really said to me but reading and fully understanding the meaning of this poem really changed my outlook.     ""No man is an island,  Entire of itself,  Every man is a piece of the continent,  A part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by the sea,  Europe is the less.  As well as if a promontory were.  As well as if a manor of thy friend's  Or of thine own were:  Any man's death diminishes me,  Because I am involved in mankind,  And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;  It tolls for thee.""      Basically, humanity is made up of billions of people. One person's life or death might seem insignificant in the whole scheme of things... but without each and every person, humanity *isn't* whole. I'm just a small part of humanity... but as a result, when someone dies or is in pain, it's also me that suffers. We're all important."

"Things like mozarts talent had drawbacks, its likely he was very autistic, and his deafness heavily contrubuted for his passion for music. A young obsession for a subject heavily changes how your brain develops. And even then, if he was dissuaded from music or had no interest he wouldn't of ever progressed with it.  The way your brain works from birth has very little to do with actual skill.  For example, the best female chess player in the world, Judit Polgar, was a child prodigy, but she wasn't born with it. From a young age, her father got her heavily interested in chess and taught her how to play and how to think with it. She was apparently much worse than her sisters originally, but eventually passed them with how obsessed she was with chess, and eventually became a grandmaster at 15 years. Why was she so good? Because she devoted herself to it instead of giving up when she failed to do well early."

"I was maybe 7 or 6 years old at Mcdonalds with my dad. They did something silly, like burn our pizza (when mcdos had pizza, remember that?!) so my dad got up with me to go complain at the cash and speak to the manager. He demanded another pizza and a fry for our inconvenience. My dad would often do things like this when something bad happened (like not getting the lunch special because it we sat down at 11:55 instead of 12:00, something that actually happened before) and it would often embarrass me. I didn't like how he seemed to make a big deal over small things, especially since my mother would always let things slide and sometimes call out my dad for being such a cheapskate (he was a lawyer, not like we couldn't afford to buy another small fry from mcdonalds!). Eventually the manager gave my dad what he wanted and we sat down to eat it. I asked why did he always do such things. His response: ""the squeaky wheel gets the oil."" This has stuck with me since. If you don't ask for something, you'll never get it, whether its that new pizza, discount on your car, promotion, date, etc."

But the third rope was still moving: the child, too light, was still breathing... And so he remained for more than half an hour, lingering between life and death, writhing before our eyes. And we were forced to look at him at close range. He was still alive when I passed him. His tongue was still red, his eyes not yet extinguished.  Behind me, I heard the same man asking: ""For God's sake, where is God?"" And from within me, I heard a voice answer: ""Where He is? This is where--hanging here from this gallows...""  That night, the soup tasted of corpses.”  ― Elie Wiesel, Night   After I read that, I started to question what kind of a God would let atrocities like this happen."

Surely an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent being could foresee any misuse of free will and take actions to prevent it?  If the reason humans are free to inflict suffering on other humans is out of God's respect for free will, it must be concluded that God cares more for the free will of tyrants than for the suffering of the oppressed."

And there’s a good chance you spend the other 2 days drinking, so you don’t have to think about that asshole boss at work. Boiled down, the advice therein is: Try to fill your days with things that you love to do, and that includes not only work, but your family and your friends.""  Mind you, I am a senior in high school, so I don't have a boss to hate, but I do have a school to hate and a good portion of the student body to hate, as well (something I can't avoid). My sophomore and junior years were filled with ""I want to go home"" and ""I wish I wasn't here"" and, of course, ""thank God it's Friday."" But after watching American Ham and hearing Nick Offerman's advice, I have taken strong efforts not to say ""thank God it's Friday."" I feel that I am happier, and, as a result, have discovered (and rediscovered) many more things I love doing such as reading more, learning more, and spending more time with my friends."

"Buy then there's the idea that some ignorance can't be helped, whereas malice is always intentional. For example, how long do you think it takes for a person to become a good, safe driver if they put their mind to it? How much of that comes down to practise?  Should we just not drive because there is no way to get from being a potentially dangerous green driver to an experienced one without exposing others to the risk of being on the road with us?  I think also that this way of looking at life makes a lot of people more willing to forgive, which is less stressful than holding a grudge. Somebody cut you off in traffic by accident? I bet you dollars to doughnuts you've done the same thing to someone else. By extension you might hope for forgiveness from the person you've wronged. But if someone cut you off *on purpose*, that person is an asshole, end of story.

We were told to remember that even if a person was getting upset at us, we needed to remember that they weren't just ""irrationally angry"". Everybody had a reason for their emotional state (usually).

"Fourth year neuroscience class, after studying neurons for a couple months and how they work (All just physics). The prof mentioned that if our brains are just neurons firing, can we have free will? Blew my fucking mind. Since then whenever I trace back a train of thought it always leads back to an external que or memory of one. All we are is a complex arrangement of neurons firing in response to our environment. We don't ""choose"" anything, not even our thoughts.   Makes it easier to have compassion with people who are fucked up, they literally have no choice in the matter (even criminals and terrorists). All we can do is try and create an environment (social and otherwise) that helps improve people's behavior."

"When I was 22, my friends and I went to Europe (Amsterdam/Munich) for 10 days.  We landed in Amsterdam, and took the train from the airport into the city.  From there we got a cab to our hostel.  The cab driver didn't say a word, we just told him the address and he drove there, even the money exchange - nothing.  So after we settled in, I needed to hit an ATM to get some Euros - I had no idea how to get Euros, but I knew we had ATMs in America, so I was hoping they had similar contraptions in Europe.   We ventured out - the first man we came across was well dressed, so I figured he could help me.  I held up my ATM card furiously waving it in the air and walked towards him yelling -   ""Excuse me, Sir, pardon me - do you know where there is a mon-ey ma-cheee-ne?  For card (I point to card) I need Euroooo-s.  Mon-ey Ma-chee-ne.""   He looked at me, paused for a second, then laughed.  ""Do you want a large money machine? - such as the ones they print the money on?  After which, they cut it up, stack it, and send it to banks.  Then, once it arrives, you can withdraw with a card such as the one in your hand, from the ""mo-ney mach-eeene"", like that one right across the street""  I was mortified  I contemplated what just happened then just started laughing - so did he, I apologized, he told me to have a good day.

I know in some fields you're GPA matters and being able to say you were Magma Cum Laude can be a CV booster, but being in business, I also had a professor who rose really fast in a lucrative career in business tell me, ""I would never hire someone with a 4.0. That must means they regurgitated the correct answers, studied too much, and didn't experience life. How does a business person excel when they are trapped only by what they are told to know, and not by experiences?"" .... Or something like that. He told me that when I was arguing about my B.

You probably don't eat enough. **Count your calories**. I was the first 25 years of my life skinny. I always thought that i eat enough and that i'm natural skinny. One day i decided to change my life and count my calories. At the first day i realized i'm not eating enough. It was really hard for me to reach my estimated goal of 3000 calories a day but i kept eating. One month after i started i gained 5 pounds and was so happy. It took me less than a half year to reach a normal weight and now i have way more energy and power. Counting calories was probably the best decision i made in my life.  Don't give up and try to eat more. You can do it.

"Well, sorta. Muhammad had no male children that survived to adulthood, but he had a son-in-law, Ali. After his death, there was some confusion about who would lead Muslims since he hadn't appointed a successor (although some Shias claim that he had appointed Ali to be his successor on his deathbed). Basically they got together and decided a companion of his would be made the caliph and eventually, Ali too was made the caliph.   Now most of these caliphs, including Ali, were brutally assassinated, but the issue arose from when a caliph before him, Uthman was assassinated and Ali was deemed to have taken insufficient action to punish the suspects. Another companion of the Prophet, Muawiya, went to war with Ali over this. Even the Prophet's wife, Ayesha and Ali warred. But supposedly, they managed to peacefully resolve their differences after the wars led to a stalemate of sorts. That didn't prevent Ali from being assassinated however. The Shiat'ul Ali then nominated his son Hassan to be the next caliph, whereas Muawiya (previously a governor), declared himself as a caliph. After a conflict, Muawiya convicted Hassan to give up his claim but he too was later poisoned by his wife. His younger brother, Hussain, took up his claim however -- and this is where the true genesis of the conflict can be found -- and opposed Muawiya's son, Yazid (who was his successor following his death). Yazid called Hussain to Karbalah, supposedly for a truce or meeting, and there he basically Red Weddinged Hussain and his followers. Since Hussain was traveling with his family and companions, he was unmatched for the army that surrounded him. They were denied water and food and after a brief struggle, most men were killed.   Thus followed a succession of mourners to Karbalah, which still defines the Shia belief system, in which Shias mourn the massacre on every anniversary of the event. With the power the Umayyad caliphate (under Yazid and his successors) had, the Shias became a marginalised, persecuted group with imams or leaders (of which Ali, Hassan and Hussain were the first three) from the Prophet's bloodline (from his daughter, Ali's wife). Most mainstream Sunnis condemn the event as well and Yazid as a name fell out of favour all over the Muslim world, but with the split between the Shias and Sunnis, over the years, the belief systems diverged even further and the conflict became a religious rather than a political one."

"I came across this post by /u/IamSilke a while back:  &gt;Everything that happens to you is your responsibility. It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility. No one else cares about you as much as you do. No one else has to deal with your shit, whether you did it or it was done to you. I know so many people whose lives would improve if only they'd stop blaming others and get on with dealing with their situation. So what if it's the other guys fault? It's your problem. Fix it. Make allowances for others being selfish, greedy, lazy, whatever - that's your responsibility too.  In the past year alone, I flunked out of college, gained fifty pounds, and burned bridges with some wonderful people because I became such a flaky, irresponsible person; things with my even more irresponsible SO became strained, culminating in a breakup; and I discovered that a close relative had relapsed after I found a water bottle full of vodka hidden under her comforter. I spent my days in bed playing video games and binging on bags of Cheetos, instead of figuring out what to do with my life. I felt powerless, thinking I had done so much damage to my life that nothing could be done to improve it.  Reading that post gave me the introspection I needed to shift my locus of control. It made me realize that some things are and will always be out of our control, and to make peace with that (e.g. other people and their own issues. You can support them and love them, but they ultimately have to be the one to better themselves). However, it made me realize how very in control I was of my life and what I was capable of doing with it. It was my responsibility to change my life for the better, and only mine.  I first focused on wanting to lose weight: I downloaded the myfitnesspal app to track my food intake, and started walking five days a week. The past month has been difficult due to the holidays and all the food that comes with it, but I have lost ten pounds in two and a half months.  I also enrolled in a local community college, with plans to transfer to a university in a few years time. I researched fields of study that would both interest me and provide a stable career after graduation, things I couldn't say for certainty with my last choice of major.  All in all, I'm still a work in progress. The only difference now is that every day I put my all into what I do."

"I've been on that side, too. I can't say I'm never there anymore. Either way, it is tough. Deciding that you won't settle for anyone just to make yourself feel better is a very healthy form of self-empowerment. Make your life about finding what makes you happy, and then sharing it with your friends. If you're still searching for what makes you happy right now, you'll find yourself most easily relating to people in the same wandering sort of position. That's not bad, but if the friendships during that phase are transient, it shouldn't be a surprise.  Some people you just share intersections with, not paths or destinations.  In short... the better you know yourself, the more quickly you know which relationships are going to last. Try to look at your ruminations as an extension of a very natural desire to connect to people, as opposed to a problem-solving process that you're not doing right. In fact, it's very natural to think you're doing it wrong."

"""Stupid people make the smart decisions for you"".      It's not something anybody told me. It's something I've learned after looking back on my life. Every relationship where I was dumped, in hindsight, I am completely grateful for. Every job that I didn't get but really wanted at the time, I would hate to be trapped in now. Every house I didn't get led me to the house that almost seemed to choose me.      Basically if a relationship, job, business deal, etc that you held up your side on didn't go through, 10/10 it's somebody else making the dumb decision and you're gonna come out ahead on it in the long run.      The people I know that are the most unhappy are the ones that tried to force a situation to happen. I'm not saying go with the flow but don't over torque the bolt.     EDIT: Additional thought. Every instance I tried to make up for the other person not holding up their end has ended up taking years from my life. Just let dumb people make life easier by sitting back and picking up the better future they leave behind."

I also have a problem with dealing with shitbags, people who don't want to work or are too stupid to do their jobs.   That quote pointed out to me something that all leaders should know, that you are not ever going to get the right soldiers for the job you need to get done. We simply don't have the numbers or training time needed to make everyone capable or willing to do what needs to get done.  Nonetheless the mission needs to get accomplished so we need to work with what we have, if a soldier is poor at a task then I as his squad/teamleader need to put him in a place where not only can he excel, but where he will gain motivation and further his skill base.   Theres a lot more too it of course. I need to learn how to better motivate soldiers and how to fit my training style to help them learn so that they can do what is needed of them, but it was life changing to stop putting square pegs into round holes. I need to fit the soldier to the task, not the task to the soldier."

The atheist debating you knows exactly what it's like to have a complete belief in something that *must* be true and how hard it is to get past that.  You're right in saying that there is just as much proof either way about the existence of God/Allah/Zeus/etc. The difference lies in our default position when faced with uncertainty. Mine is to keep an open mind on either side until conclusive evidence proves of disproves the hypothesis, but until that happens, I will remain neutral. Something that's unfalsifiable shouldn't have the default belief be that it's true."

"Then replace ""God grant me"" with ""Boy, I wish I had"". The religious bent is largely unrelated to the sentiment.

An attitude of ""there's nothing you can do so just accept it"" should be one adopted with care."

He was right, even after I had some girls like me or hook up with me, the ""confidence"" I was feeling disappeared. It really does have to come from within."

I'm sure he said it to give me confidence in choosing to study what I'm passionate about, but it made me realize how much time I spend worrying that my time could be spent better, and how this is the ultimate waste of time.

I have tried to tell her that no one on earth expects get to get *over* it, but it is high time she gets *past* it. She still continues to linger in this sorrow and it is sabotaging her life."

"Because in modern society we want to believe that there is always an answer, and that getting an answer will make you happy.  That is not always the case.  I am a diagnosed hypochondriac who takes medication.  I used to spend all of my time trying to figure out why I felt certain sensations, and most of the time doctors just shrugged and said ""I don't know, but it's probably not serious.""  That wasn't good enough for me.  I spent hours and hours worrying and trying to figure out what was causing my symptoms, worsening my health, developing cycles of anorexia and binge eating from the stress, creating EXTRA symptoms that were solely due to stress, and ultimately, it didn't improve my life.  Now that I'm on medication I don't care about finding answers, and I'm happy.  I'd rather live a short life and not know when death is coming than live  long, constantly miserable life.  I think that God is the same way.  There's no way to tell whether God is real or isn't, and this rationality thing has only been around for a while.  It's just one way of thinking about things.  There are others.  Who knows which one is the ""best"" way of thinking?  How do you judge the best?  I think it should be judged by what does the most good.  My religion doesn't hurt me, it doesn't hurt anyone else, it makes me happy, and my feelings make me believe it's true.  I don't know why people have such a stake in getting me not to believe."

"My highschool biology teacher was a stout atheist who wasn't afraid to talk about his (non) belief, especially when it came to matters dealing with evolution and creation and everything in between. Prior to having him for class, I was a devoted Christian, and he helped pave the way to my life as a convinced atheist."
"Maybe this works for some but for me as as an already insecure, self-loathing teen it cuts me deep to this day. The unconditional love part just felt like it was an obligation of genetics. Logically I get it now but I still keep her far away both emotionally and physically. I also made a point to tell my son I both liked and loved him as he was growing up. We have an awesome relationship."
"(Or skinny people.) people think that commenting on appearance is okay if you're more socially acceptable in appearance. Look making pointed comments about any physical trait is rude and should not happen. I'm 28, 6' 5"" and I weigh 150. I know I'm skinny and do you really think I starve myself and have not been trying for 28 years to find some way to fill out? Your jokes about me surviving the Holocaust or you having to starve for a few months to get my body are disrespectful, not helpful. I'm not clueless to the fact I'm skinny but it seems some people are clueless to what constitutes appropriate discussion."

"""Whatever you put your time in to is what you'll get""  One of my best friends is a beautiful person who has endured alot of pain in his life. In high school,  he was supposed to be the person who did the most with their life whether it was to be a lawyer or an actor(something he did end up doing) but Instead he struggles with mental illness and schizophrenia That isnt exactly relevant but we've been out of high school now for twice as long as we were in it and most of the people we knew have careers and families-it's a weird time dealing with preconceived expectations, the route life takes you that is vastly different than you imagined and the unexpected failures, successes, anxieties and doubts that permeate early adulthood. So to see my friend for the first time in a while and have him say this to me at a time when I needed to hear it most really opened my eyes because I realized we are all basically experiencing the same things in life. He was going through alot of the things I was going through  On a direct note this quote really hit me because it's true. And relating to the way adulthood is as opposed to how you imagine it will be, time becomes nor valuable than ever and its a limited resource, so you have to learn to prioritize in order to get what you want in life. It also made me realize we're responsible for gettinf what we want in life, we just have to work for it and put the time into it."
"Nothing wrong with making mistakes; Something is wrong if you dont.   If you learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others you are a better person for it.    If you continue to struggle and as a result make many more unique mistakes, you are also a better person for it."
"""Do not quit. You'll have challenging, even heartbreaking days. But you'll also have days so wonderful you can't believe it.""      My bassoon instructor at a fine arts camp dropped this among a few other wonderful quotes on our last day of technique rehearsals. This was during a time where I was questioning how long I'd continue music because sometimes my level didn't match up with what I was being presented with. He was just sharing some quotes he's kept jotted down in his phone, but it made me think of all the wonderful opportunities I would've never had if I'd quit. I couldn't put a price tag on those irreproducible memories if I wanted to."

"You can't argue with someone's feelings.  In other words, if someone tells you they feel sad, happy, angry, hurt, disappointed, etc, you can't just debate them out of their feeling or tell them they're wrong about their own feelings. It's been a very helpful revelation in a lot of situations. For example, if someone tells you you did something that hurt them, instead of just trying to argue them out of it, it forces you to stop and view it form their perspective and think about what you did that was hurtful."
I think the idea is that it's the thing that people can't change that are their biggest insecurities. More of a guideline than a set rule though.
"I was in a Spanish supermarket in the middle nowhere Spain, and some teenagers comes up to me speaking spanish.   I told them I don't speak Spanish only English and he just switched to perfect English to ask 'could you buy us alcohol please?'

"I used to (and still am quite a bit) be very self conscious. I remember looking in the mirror trying to make my hair look good, giving myself a smile and going ""oh hell no this is baaaad"". However, every once in a while to help myself get by I'd start thinking about other people doing the same routine. I know for a fact there's a decent amount of people out there who do the same thing, look at themselves and think oh boy this is gonna be a bad day, just based on how they look that morning. But then I'd really think. I'd run it through in my head and think of times I've walked down the halls at school or walked into work, no one really looks BAD you know? You look at everyone and they all just seem to be normal. And I realized even if I'm thinking my smile looks awkward or my hair looks a bit off, everyone else is so concerned over the same things about themselves that they only see you as another normal person. They aren't taking the time to look at you and pick out what's off about you.   Sorry for the even longer rant!   Tl;dr: took my a while to realize but everyone's a little self conscious. And everyone's too worried about themselves to notice the little things you're worrying about, about yourself."

"Yes.  Timeline:  Diagnosed with depression, symptoms didnt improve... After fainting a few times while exercising, I was eventually diagnosed with diabetes. Psychological symptoms got much worse. Went through loads of anti-depressants. Finally diagnosed with various b vitamin deficiencies after neuropathy and retinopathy get bad Now diagnosed with DPD.  DPD doesn't exclude depression. I don't think I suffer from depression, in that I don't' fell negative about anything. I feel disconnected. I used to have a gf, career, loads of hobbies, etc... It's not that I can't have those things. They just don't do anything for me. I'm not really invested in my narrative anymore.  I just work a few months and travel the rest of the year, on my own. Before I'd have thought such a life wasteful. Now I just don't care.   I know it sounds like I'm painting myself as unique, or iamverysmart material, but that's more representative of what I used to be.  Now, there's definitely a lot of play to be had with whats psychological, and what caused what. But I'm definitely not ego driven, and I absolutely have no personal narrative anymore. It used to be I wanted the best career, friends, wife, and kids. I really was very invested in my narrative, often to the extreme expense of immediate pleasures, strong relationships, and other important things. The course of the rest of my life is to travel and, at some point, die. I can't really say that'll make me happy, because part of the DPD for me is a strong detachment from emotions. But I feel no displeasure or despondency at the thought, and it provides me hedonistic pleasure, which is all I can connect with, now."

"A post that Hutch (the Youtuber) made not too long ago kinda stuck with me:   ""I try to keep this type of thinking in my life: happiness is not the primary goal for me. Can you call what I'm feeling happiness in a moment like scuba diving? Or shoving all in for 2,000 bucks? Or watching the waves come in at sunset when there's no one else around? Holding my niece moments after she was born? First date with the girl I'm now in love with? Driving to Los Angeles with everything I owned about to start a completely different type of life? The moment a video I worked very hard on went live? My sister's wedding? In those moments I feel an wide range of emotions not limited to happiness: excited, curious, vulnerable, uncertain, thankful, confident, disarmed, stimulated, energetic...and the list goes on and on. What I experience as happiness usually comes to me in moments when I look back on all the notable experiences in my life that were colored by just about every emotion you can have. Happiness being the ultimate goal seems like an unrealistic goal, and for me I think it's a harmful one. I'd prefer to have the goal of exploration and acceptance of all the feelings that come along with it. Seems much more interesting in the long run."""

Kiddo B: ""The domesticated wolf!"" Kiddo C: ""Whatever animal has a specific genome!""   I however, was just flabbergasted. Every time I thought a classmate or I had an answer, I painfully realised it was just a description, an arbitrary definition. I just couldn't wrap my head around it, and it kept me busy for days.   I think that was the first day I understood the importance and difficulty of conceptualisation. Concepts are arbitrary, and are just approximations of what is. If an essence is what is shared by a collection of things or patterns, generally only that total collection might contain a perfect essence, the rest is an approximation.     It taught me to challenge everything and aim to understand things flexibly and in multiple perspectives, which benefits me to this day in my studies of the brain and mind.  Thanks Coos!"

It really makes me sad because he was a cool guy apart from that."
"If someone's devastated over something that happened to them that doesn't seem like a big deal to you.. Remember that even if you've been through worse hardships, this may be the worst thing that's ever happened to them. They're allowed to be upset about it. And on the other hand, don't feel bad about being upset with your life just because children are starving in Africa. Your experiences and your feelings matter regardless of how they compare to other people's."

"If you do something wrong and you know it's wrong, don't keep doing it. From a band teacher who was talking about holding a bad note that was blatantly wrong.

It's something I took from being in music that doesn't apply to it anymore."
"I'm paraphrasing because I was very young, ""It's going to hurt, there's nothing you can do about that. It's how you handle the pain now and in the future that will limit you.""

I don't know if he ment it any deeper than that, but it has influenced a lot of how I live my life."

But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!   Now, if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you.

Spanish is difficult at first with all the different verb-formes but once you catch them you feel like the world has no limits.  With English I gave up.

Second I didn't so I don't believe it, I said I doubted it. The difference is large when you think about it. To answer your fourth question, I do it because I'm a BAD person. I am one of the worst people I know. I'm selfish, self centered, and lazy. The purpose of Christ is to help me become a better person. Christian, follower of Christ, I follow his teachings of love and selflessness to the best of my human abilities. Ill mess up and make mistakes, and I can't avoid it. But I can try to, and regret my choices and learn from him. And your last question regarding my mortality, your right. I am afraid of death, like all humans are. To fear the end of one's existence is natural, and anyone who doesn't fear that is lying or a fool. But you are wrong in thinking I follow because I believe I will go to heaven. I do it because I want to be a better person. Because it's what I feel is right. The heaven thing is nice if it happens, but if it isn't- if there is nothing, I still would follow. Because I want to love like Christ did, unconditionally. I hope that helps you understand."

Nothing. So what do you have to fight about? There's no reason. Just break up with him.  I dumped him that next day and it was definitely the best decision of my life.

"I prefer to say that all languages are complex as fuck, it's just that you're used to the complexity of one of them.  However, compare a hawaiian text with a greenlandic one:  &gt; Hānau kū'oko'a 'ia nā kānaka apau loa, a ua kau like ka hanohano a me nā pono kīvila ma luna o kākou pākahi. Ua ku'u mai ka no'ono'o pono a me ka 'ike pono ma luna o kākou, no laila, e aloha kākou kekahi i kekahi.

Silaqassusermik tarnillu nalunngissusianik pilersugaapput, imminnullu iliorfigeqatigiittariaqaraluarput qatanngutigiittut peqatigiinnerup anersaavani. (Greenlandic)  Most people would immediately agree with a statement that greenlandic is obviously much more complex than hawaiian - simply because greenlandic words are scarily long. And if you gave them time to study the languages until they could read the texts (in both cases, it's article 1 of the universal declaration of human rights, btw), I wouldn't be surprised if many still agreed with that. The reason is that hawaiian words are largely invariable - a word won't show up in many different forms, while in greenlandic, verbs conjugate in complex ways, nouns have cases etc.   However, Hawaiian's complexity hides in different areas: which words can go with which in a sentence? Where do they go? Does a word mean the same thing in every context, or does one have to learn twenty definitions for every word? The overall complexity is the same, it's just been shifted around to less immediately visible areas. In English, for example, the Tense-Aspect-Mood system is fairly complex, but it's hidden beneath a pile of auxilary verbs and adverbs instead of showing everything right on the verb with a few simple, but scary suffixes.  Dunno why I wrote all of this."

"[Plato's allegory of the Cave -The Republic Book VII](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave)  It isn't a story about there being no solid reality, and everything being an opinion.  The meaning of this story is the three prisoners are trapped in a cave, they are unable to escape their current reality, so they can only see a shadow of the true reality.   Based on their perception, they start to play guessing games as to what is really happening, and convince themselves that the shadows, and their interpretation of those shadows are the truth and reality.  Now the prisoner is forced out of the cave but is unable to look upon the sun because he has been in darkness his whole life, he is in pain and therefore angry, so he tries to retreat back into the cave, where the light of truth does not exist, and because he is used to the darkness and not the light.  When he is forced out of the cave, and forced to remain outside he experiences the short term pain and anger, but gradually adjusts, and starts to see the true reality and not the one that he had imagined in the cave.  When he goes back to advise the others, they do not believe him, because his eyes have difficulty adjusting to the darkness, and he no longer sees what they see, the others believe he has been injured by the light.  So in the case of Isis, their reality is wrong because their minds are closed to the light of truth, and they cannot comprehend that they are wrong, so they become angry and fight against anyone trying to show them truth.  Let us try a more modern allegory:  For example, let us say that you have grown up in a small town USA with a population of 50. Everyone you know has the same religion, your only news comes from a hardcore local news station hosted by Donald Trump, and the only radio station is talkback radio.  So everyone else has the same viewpoint (kinda like some of reddit's echo chambers). Now imagine that you have been there since birth and are now 50 years old. You have been told over and over that everything is Obama's fault and that the muslims are taking over.   Suddenly out of nowhere someone shows up in your town and drags you out into the big bad world. You become angry, and hurt because you are blinded by all that hatred that you fed on, and you are being forced to see what you don't want to see. So you flee back to your hometown where you feel safe and comfortable.  This time the stranger drags you out of your town and forces you to stay in the city, until you have been deprogrammed, and can see and understand for yourself that everything you believed was wrong.  As you adjust and come to that realisation, you go back to help your family and friends in your home town come to the same realisation. However when you return home you are no longer thinking in the same way as them and you don't see things in the same way because you know the truth. So you don't fit in anymore, they hate you for changing and try to kill you.  TL/DR: Truth and Enlightenment is painful"

"I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s the one that I will wear on my funeral a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion.   The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.  Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind. When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:  Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like. Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.  It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.  Take control of your life Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.  Appreciate the people around you Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted.   It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is.   I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.  We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.   You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. I hope you will make the right choice.  Leave a mark in this world. Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!  Thank you!   Credit: u/mylasttie"

"&gt;Nah man that's fucked up.  I went to Florida for my friend's bday and he brought his other friend too who was cool enough and we could get along but I thought he was kind of a dumbass and I didn't really like him because he reminded me of some other dumbass I used to know.  Anyway, we go fishing and I caught an octopus.  I wanted to take the hook out and throw it back but it put its suckers on me and it was too weird and it has that beak that could maybe mess up my fingers so I was just going to throw it back with the hook, so what?  The other guy who I thought wasn't so great says, ""Nah man, that's fucked up.""  He grabs the octopus, works the hook out in like two seconds and throws it back.  Going into that day if someone asked who was going to sink a metal hook into some animal's mouth and then throw it into the ocean to slowly die or else live with a hook in its mouth for however long, I definitely would have been 100% that it was the other guy and not me.  I would never do that.  As it turns out, it was me.  It was a total mindfuck.  I couldn't believe how badly I'd misjudged him (and myself for that matter).  It's not like throwing the octopus back with the hook in its mouth would have been a big travesty but the fact is that he was the one who helped the animal and I was going to just leave it.  The scope is very minor, and it wasn't a big deal at the time, but in hindsight I just couldn't believe how badly I'd misjudged.  It's humbling and now I try to keep my judgmentalness in check and am (more) careful to act in a way that is consistent with who I think I am."

Either you believe in God and Jesus or not so I feel like especially there, either the prayer is nothing or it's from God and Jesus, right?   Also I grew up around a lot of Mormons. They do this thing with baptism by proxy for dead people that weren't Mormon when they died. Some people have a *huge* issue with this! First off, from what I understand, they only do this for a mormon's relatives and with permission (which was not always the case iirc). But even besides if you believe the Mormon God isn't the real God, this ceremony or whatever does absolutely nothing. If I died and they wanted to proxy baptize me, I give no shits. If they're right, looks like get saved. If I'm right, I'm still worm food and they wasted a few minutes of their limited lifespan.  Even more with people fighting non-Christians.

I said something along the lines of ""I just wish people weren't offended so easily.""  Without a second thought, she said ""Who are you to decide what is or isn't offensive? Are you some grand arbitrator of offensive things?""  I still remember that extremely clearly, and I think about it really often. I think that's something I needed to hear, and it's helped me empathize with people rather than just assume they're ""too sensitive""."

These are things that a lot of adult men realize in hindsight fucked them up, but to see it as a 15 year old when me and my friends were just starting to receive this pressure was a life altering experience. From then on I was more concious of what was true wisdom and what was just bullshit told to me by older friends, and I opened myself up more, felt better about crying, things like that. I feel that reading that book has made me a more emotionally and socially healthy man than I otherwise would be."

When I was a teenager, I was weighed down by so much hate for my abusive household, my school, and especially at myself. I wanted things to be different, for people to just be kind and understanding for once in my lifetime, and I tended to lash out and push people away rather than try and live up to the ideal I wanted to see. A good friend of mine pulled me aside and explained WHY those words were important, and why we have to set the example if we want to see change around us.   It wasn't easy, but I did my best to put aside my anger and try to be a better person. I started college off fresh in a new environment where I could begin again, and went into a career of public service. Through my actions helping others and receiving kindness and love in kind, I've never regretted living up to it.    I still fail some days, as we all do, but I'll never let that stop me from trying."

Most jobs have a handful of hard to train skills that can be widely applied. For instance, working as part of a team.   I have never heard of a company that was worried that someone would stick around too long. That is not a thing that happens in most jobs.  Lastly, Most interviewers would be his peers in age. That alone would give a huge leg up. No one likes being discriminated by age, but if two candidates are both qualified for a job you pick the one you like more.

"&gt; Even native speakers have some issues with grammar.  I disagree with this.  The ""grammar"" that native speakers have issues with is the specific formal grammar taught in English books, which isn't *exactly*what true English is.  English is an evolving language like all languages, and changes throughout time, much like Italian (and other romance languages) is what happened when Latin was passed on from generation to generation over thousands of years.  So the English we speak is slightly different from the English in those grammar books, and small things like the who/whom distinction are disappearing.  A native speaker may mispronounce some words wrong, may use the wrong vocabulary or have a smaller vocabulary overall, and some may have terrible *writing* skills, but no native speaker without mental disorders like aphasia will have issues with grammar.  Even the dumbest people you meet will have a 100% grasp of true English grammar, with minor variations according to location (""team"" is pluralized in England, for example).  &gt;But these days, I don't see that happen as often anymore. So many ""they're"" and 'their"" mix ups go uncorrected.  This isn't because people are making the mistake more.  The younger you are, the more likely you are to be writing more and are exposed to more writing in general. This greatly increases spelling abilities.  I actually notice worse spelling with Baby Boomers. Seriously, linguists seem to be in agreement that the internet and texting have made spelling better.  If things seem worse to you, it's because you're simply noticing it more because people didn't use to have social networks."
"I sometimes wish I had the courage to tell people not to be shy.   I work retail and a guy with very basic english was trying to find baking foil.   He wanted to be sure he had the right stuff, but didn't know how to ask. So he asked for 'cooking foil', which was fine, then pointed to the foil take-out style containers and asked 'this same?' So I kind of went, ""you want this..."" and pointed to the baking foil, ""made of this?"" and pointed to the container. He nodded, but seemed shy.   So I just pointed to a few and said they were all that.   It's like... dude, don't feel bad your English is bad. You are trying to speak another language. I can't do that.    But I feel like it'd be rude to tell them, or they might misunderstand and think I am being mean.    I just want them to be happy."

"I doubt this will ever be seen since I'm late to the thread, but....  I play jazz guitar.  I played very, very seriously for a number of years, and studied with a guy named Ted Greene.  In jazz guitar circles he's pretty well known, but you're really have to be a chord melody nerd  to have heard of him.  I studied with him for a number of years.  He was the only man I've ever met who lives up to the phrase ""genius"".  More than that, he was kinda like a Buddha.  Seriously.  Very, very wise, relaxed, and well...  He knew what mattered in life and didn't.  I swear I got more out of studying with him than I did from all the therapy sessions I've had.    Once early in my studies he sent me home with some homework.  Create several 8 bar examples of contrary motion, fill in the outer voices with interesting chromatic chords, etc.  I went home, practiced, wrote up my progression and went back a month later.  He asked me to play, and of course I was a bit nervous.  I made a mistake, apologized and asked to start again.  Ted looked at me and said ""No.  Play it again just as you had the first time, and when you get to the mistake let the notes ring.""  I complied.  With the ""mistake"" resonating in the background he looked at me and said ""You know, if you just let yourself hear it for what it is....  It's beautiful.""  He then proceeded to show me all the amazing things my ""mistake"" could lead to.  It was an epiphany in the truest sense of the word.  It completely changed my feelings about myself, about 'mistakes', about my playing....  It changed my entire perspective.  I miss you Ted."

She was upset that I woke her up and probably extremely tired before blurting out, ""He's not hitting you that hard!"" before rolling over and going back to sleep while scoffing at the thought of being disturbed.   That was it. That was the day I abandoned hope and didn't complain or cry ever again. I laid with my eyes closed pretending to sleep while she got fucked on the floor.

When he told me this I started questioning religion and looking at it from a different point of view instead of faith. Granted he was only 14 when he told me this but at the time a bomb exploded in my brain and it was like I could see things clearly. Pretty much right after that I stopped going to church.

That was it. No matter how much I practiced, how many worksheets I did, how many times the teacher looked at me like I was an idiot.

"I agree.  I think it's just a frame of reference thing.  Some people are thinkers and some people would rather have someone else think for them.  Some people can make sense of the world around them better than others, regardless of their religion of beliefs I think these things contribute to their ability to be better people.    Not to blatantly say that they're not as good if they don't or can't, but what's better, to require someone else to tell you something is good, or to decide for yourself that it's good based on your own observations weighed against your own beliefs and convictions?  It's better to be able to do that on your own with a stable frame of reference rather than have to filter all through someone else's whose frame of reference is largely unknown."

And now that some places are more and more atheist, we're also seeing that many atheists just go along with the system they were born into.

"Back in my first year of university, I had this Philosophy lecturer who I still consider the single greatest teacher I have ever had during all my years of education.  Anyway, in one of my introduction units on the nature of morality we were discussing the differences between 'Objectivism', 'Subjectivism' and 'Relativism'. He went around the class after the lecture and asked everyone what they considered themselves.  Most people said they were Objectivists or Subjectivists, but there was this one girl at the back of the class who had her feet up on the table and was leaning back in her chair. She defiantly piped up by saying 'Well, I'm a relativist.'  The class went silent for a moment. The lecturers' head slowly turned and he fixed his gaze on her. There was a pause, before he opened his mouth and said 'reeeeeaaaaaalllyyy...' in the most drawn-out and condescending tone possible. We could all tell something was coming.  For the next 40 minutes of the tutorial, the lecturer proceeded to logically destroy every single argument that came out of her mouth. No matter which way she tried to defend Moral Relativism, he tore the argument down in mere moments. This continued until the end of the tute, where the girl left flustered and I never saw her in that class again.  That day I learned a valuable lesson about forming opinions and arguments that has stuck with me since: Don't state one unless you can either adequately back it up, admit its shortfalls or completely abandon it if required.  **TL;DR:** Lecturer destroyed an uninformed and arrogant student, learned that you should think carefully about what you believe and what you say"

"You can only change when you're ready.  I was 220 lbs at 5'7"" (~172cm). A hair away from diabetes, to be fair.   I was in the doctor's office, and that horrible, billowing silence that comes with standing on a personal precipice, pushed there by a simple truth. I was either going to die, or lose weight.   Oh sure, it doesn't sound that dramatic, but if you're in an accident, obese and diabetic, even the smallest complication can lead to serious problems in anything afterwards. The way my doctor just said, in an almost apologetic tone, ""You're pre-diabetic"", it just scared the fuck out of me.  I realized then that I had the motivation to lose weight: *I was going to die if I didn't*.   So now when I hear about addicts going through rehab for the n^th time, or people on a diet again, I don't roll my eyes or shake my head. I have some sympathy, because I understand what it's like to try, and try, and try again, without knowing that they're not ready.   You will only make that change when you're ready. Find out what that looks like.  Edit: I'm now 179lbs and still losing. I hit the gym with regularity (And I like the change I'm seeing!) because I'm unemployed and looking to make the most of my time. I'm on meds to treat my bipolar.

A group of three elderly people were walking by to get to their car, the one smallest elderly guy comes over and says hi, to which we greeted him back.  He told us: ""you guys, whether you're joking or not with your friend, never tease someone about something that they can't change. Be nice to him."" We apologized to our friend Hunter and to the elderly man, he smiled and thanked us for sounding so sincere and walks off. We kind of just sat there and let it sink in, then I thought to myself, like wow... Holy shit he's right. I always wondered if he himself got teased about his height and that's why he said that.

From time to time to, usually every 3 or for months, I would have to ask my parents for a few $$, usually because I splurged on something I may or may not have needed. After about a year or so of this, my mom, in her ever tactful way, said to me "" I will help you this time, but on the condition you actually think about something. I want you to think about what you would do if we ( my stepdad and her) were not here to help anymore. We are getting older, stepdad in poor health, mine isn't getting better. We will not always be here to help or save you"".  Keep in mind I had been in and gotten out of the Army and didn't really know what life for me was going to be yet. I thought for awhile on it, and made some big life changes. She was right. It was time I became totally self reliant and self supported.    I have had many ups and even more downs in my life, but I can say with a clear conscience this one thing. The only person I owe is my mother for making me stand on my own two feet.

"So many false statements there. The person in their 40s automatically has a weaker resume because the rest of their work experience is totally irrelevant to where they're applying in the vast majority of cases.  As for the team statement, older people usually are the problem people in teams and companies know this.  Many companies are worried about having older people stick around too long as it causes for stagnation in many instances specifically because you have an older person in a low level position that holds everyone back. Companies want people past 40 or so to be leaders and managers, not some low level cog.  As for your final point, interviewers despise interviewing people their own age when that old. Furthermore, most interviewers are in their late 20s, early 30s, so he'd be older at 40 and would be considered a joke candidate out of the gate compared to everyone else.  As for your final final point, when team building, age is way more important than you'd think. You really don't want your say 35 year old team leader to be managing someone 40 and lower level than them; that causes for the 40 year old to immediately feel inferior and will cause rifts like 99% of the time.  Older people in low level positions are incredibly at a disadvantage and going to school later in life is really not the solution. There's a fuckton of high paying jobs out there that don't require a degree whatsoever that offer benefits, pension, etc. Go be a train conductor. Work in construction. Be a warehouse manager.

"Except for my above story which actually mimicks what you guys are saying (about some one at the exchange counter getting impatient with me cause I couldn't speak french very well and she just wanted to get the transaction done), when I went to France they all were very nice to me.

I thought the country was a little overly excited about the fact I was an american honestly."

This is just absolutely not true.  There are languages with completely different schemas than Indo-European ones, and how easily writing is decyphered won't change that.  Do you think that Spanish will be an ""easy"" language to learn for someone who speaks in a language with ergative-absolutive alignment?    Spanish is easy for INDO-EUROPEAN speakers.  That doesnt mean it's easy for people who are used to languages with 20 genders or with an incredibly complex or incredibly simple inflectional scheme, etc."

"Why? Why would you choose an actor for primarily their looks? That's senseless and we see movies go wrong all the time for doing this.  Like I said, looks obviously play a role, but certainly not the primary role. Acting requires actors, not models. When they do just out and hire models they always start as ditsy side characters with minor roles because the director knew not to put his eggs in that basket. Hundreds of models try to make a break into the pictures but never succeed because all they have is there looks. My girlfriends sister is actually a model and has been trying for years to get into a movie.  I'm sure we are just two different people with differing opinions on this and since there is no scientific fact regarding this nor business statistics it would be a waste of both our times to try to debate this. I feel that logically it would be foolish to pick actors solely for their looks, though I'm sure it plays an important part. Perhaps actors are just motivated to look good to hedge their bets? Acting itself though is quite an art and few people have the real ability to act like a lot of A-list actors do. What's your logic on this? Maybe I'm missing something."

"Congrats on getting your degree. But I just want to bring you down to earth a little bit.   Having the soft skills is indispensable for your career. I agree with that, and as a person that doesn't have great soft skills, or sometimes doesn't care to use them I am jealous.   Having soft skills for someone like you is a double edged sword though. You will most likely find it easier to break into management, get roles with power over other developers, etc. However most of the time this means one thing, you hard technical skills will suck. I have had plenty of bosses with great soft skills, however their technical skill was lacking because soft skills and career came first rather than the actual requirements of the job.   For example my current boss is somewhat in your position however he got the job at our startup because he impressed our nontechnical CEO with his supposed malleability and caring about business goals. However this makes him a terrible engineer, because he doesn't tell the CEO we need to focus on making our product robust (for two reasons, he doesn't have experience with the how and the why is something he is vaguely familiar with) because the CEO doesn't care about anything other than business goals. Since the CEO doesn't believe there is a large and unquanitfiable money sink of having non-robust non-automated processes it will never get fixed.  Personally I don't really respect his technical work because of that lack of skill, and lack of caring and the fact that he actually has power over me.   It will be relatively easy for you to find yourself in the same position because you have more corporate and life experience compared to your peers, just don't Michael Scott yourself."

So, in the case of religion, someone who believes that Jesus is coming back in their lifetime but is otherwise a kind person to others might still make decisions based on the idea that the world will end. Think environmental responsibility, for instance. Of course this is a cherry picked example but I think the point is made.   When someone has a set of chosen beliefs, those beliefs guide his or her actions. If that set of beliefs has them giving food to the homeless on the weekends then wonderful, but if the same set of beliefs has them bigoted toward homosexuals then it would at least be understandable that someone might not want to be acquainted with said person even if they meet them at the soup kitchen."

"That optimism and life being fair are wholly determined by your willingness to observe and run proper experiments.   My dad read me the text below when I was a kid - it's from a 1991 book review. I never forgot it, and to this day still use the train analogy to remember I am in the fastest checkout line this time, or that my lane of traffic is zooming past the rest.  If you are going to consider yourself unlucky when bad things happen, be fair to yourself and be sure to observe the good things with equal effort.     from [NYTimes Book Review](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/books/books-of-the-times-why-unshakable-belief-isn-t-the-same-as-truth.html)     ""Consider the subway effect. It seems to be a natural law of the universe that when we are waiting in a subway station (especially late at night), train after train comes in the opposite direction before one arrives that is heading the way we want to go. The rational side of us realizes that while this might be true in isolated cases, it can't be true all of the time. But deep down we feel that more often than not, we are the victims of some great cosmic injustice.  Actually, we are being fooled by a cognitive illusion, what Mr. Gilovich calls a hedonic asymmetry. Suppose you are standing on the platform and see three trains go by before one comes your way. You get on board and the experiment is over. It is impossible under the circumstances to observe the reverse situation: several trains coming in your direction before one comes the opposite way. But you can be sure that standing on the other platform is someone who is sure that it is he who is being singled out by the great dispatcher in the sky.  Our brains are so primed to see patterns that they leap out at us at the slightest provocation. Then we construct theories to explain the regularity we think we have found in the world."""

"All of that is true, but I've noticed something interesting. If you go to Quebec, nearly everyone can speak English. It may be a little broken with some wrong pronunciations, but it's more or less easily understandable to a native English speaker.   However, that isn't the case on the flipside. In Ontario we start learning French in grade 4, and then it's mandatory until grade 9, at which point it becomes an elective. (I'm ignoring immersion/extended programs, and assuming the regular, core program.) At that point, many native English speakers decide to stop taking French, because they figure that they speak English, and that they can get through life with just that. As a result, much less of the English speaking population speaks French, as opposed to the French population speaking English.  I just thought that's interesting. Despite the fact that they're constitutionally equal, many English speakers still don't come even close to the proficiency in French that French speakers have in English."

His parents cut him off, and for the rest of his life he will work a low paying job and have to live off of each paycheck.

"&gt;Ehh English isn't really Spanish's cousin.  Yes it is.   A cousin is someone who is demonstrably related, and you may not notice at first glance the similarities, but if you know what you're looking for, you can.  Spanish and English being cousins is a great analogy.  This is *highly* simplified but PIE is the grandfather, his kids are proto-slavic, proto-germanic, latin, greek, proto-aryan, gaelic (and others).  Proto-slavic had kids Russian, Polish, Urakian, Slovenian, etc, Latin had french, italian, spanish, portuguese, etc, Aryan made Urdu and Hindi, Gaelic made Irish and Welsh, Germanic made Swedish, English, German.  There are of course other languages in between.  But French, Italian and Spanish are *very* closely related...they are brother languages.  English and Spanish are more removed than that but the point of divergence is not far off, and because of that, they share many similarities."

I think the point is that kids are going to generally be a little crazy and admittedly a little rotten at times that's mostly apart of what it is like being a kid. A parents role is to correct those behaviors in their process of raising a kid so that they learn how to be a well behaved adult. No one needs to teach kid how to have fun or play they'll do that naturally what they need to be taught is usually proper behavior and etiquette.

I heard this as a young man and with my wife at the time we decided to live our lives along those lines.  We valued people over things and when we had the chance to do something, even hair brained or on a shoe string budget, we did it.

"My old roomate and at-the-time best friend once messaged me over Facebook during a particular time in my life when I was just always negative, and would push people away. He said:  ""Immediately stop picking on peoples weaknesses, do what I do, expose their qualities and strengths; it makes them feel good about themselves and you too for noticing. When you make people feel good when you're around, they are going to remember that feeling whenever you show up, you'll be well received and missed often.""  Struck a chord with me.

I felt like I had potential, but after years of being reminded that I'm not any higher than trash, I lost all hope and belief I could be anything. I'm actually extremely talented, but I have difficulties doing things with my talent, because of my broken mindset.   Years later I'm stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of self-hate I can't break out of.  Those words changed me from believing in myself to believing I'll be nothing.   Years of failing college over and over,  having countless relationship issues, getting fired from jobs, and wondering if I'll have somewhere to live has done nothing more than proved it to me."

But every weekend he goes out and gets plastered, some shots some beers. Maybe sometimes he gets a case, stays home and spends less. Maybe sometimes he buys some pot or meets a nice lush and spends more.  How much do you think he spends on that weekend shit? People can easily spend much more people can spend less. Let's pretend Friday and Saturday night combined run him $50 because we are stupid.  Let's pretend he decides he will cut it in half from January to April. He cuts out partying every other weekend and puts that super accurate amount of $50 in a jar instead of letting it evaporate from his fingers. By April, dude will have $800. You think he's going to regret not shelling out a few odd weekends for Busch Light when he's making memories in Dominican Republic five nights all-inclusive?"

"I had a master class in composition with Ellen Taffe Zwilich in the early 1990s. One person asked her what was her motivation to compose.   Her response was that she always hears music in her head. If that music matches what other people are writing, she doesn't do anything with it and instead supports the people who are writing what she is hearing in her head at the time. But if the music in her head doesn't match what other people are writing, then she said she has an *obligation* to humanity to put those notes on paper and to share them.  The idea that sharing your creativity is an obligation to humanity kinda hit me strong. Also, I stopped trying to ape other composers unless I was paid to do so. I stopped being prolific for the sake of being prolific."

I was talking to my friend's dad about how I wanted people to explore other planets to colonize them. He replied with something along the lines ""We only have one planet; this is our home and we need to take care of it."" It seems like a small gesture, but it helped me realize that the problem wasn't the things around me, but my own behavior. Since then I've been pursuing nursing so that I can take care of people and I've been doing my best to see more of what this amazing world has to offer, and my depression has evaporated for a whole year by now.

"This always bugged me about cartoons that I watched when I was younger, the villains were often portrayed as being deliberately and indulgently evil. I get that these are cartoons for kids and maybe moral ambiguity wasn't the most pressing thing to include, but if you watched shows like The Smoggies or Captain Planet you definitely got the idea that pollution came from people who deliberately made pollution because they hated the planet. Kids were encouraged to love the planet (not bad) but made to think that loving the planet would be enough to save it. Like we could live our lives the way we do and just make a conscious choice to reject pollution, lol.  There was no room to consider that nobody pollutes to fight against a clean environment, they do it to make money, and we're all complicit. Those toxic chemicals the smoggies tried to dump on the sun tots might as well have been byproducts from producing an animated series that kids love, huh?  The result of this failure to acknowledge the nonexistence of actual supervillains as they have been portrayed is a generation of young people with tremendous anxiety about climate change (etc) and a desire for activism but with no way to recognize their complicity in the problems... or to think reasonably about solutions."

"My seven year old daughter sitting me down to have 'a talk' and saying: Dad, you can't keep on hitting me. I'm a good person and I deserve respect. You can talk to le and teach me, correct me or even scold me, but don't hit me again. I deserve respect and be treated with love. I told her about my abusive mother, and she told me: Well, you don't live with her anymore, then you don't have to be like that. I will talk with grandma about this. Don't worry, daddy. I have never felt more loved in my life than with that talk. I love my daughter so much that I could even do the impossible task of changing my old violent ways just for her."

"An American internet friend was explaining each generations great turmoil and cited 9/11 as one of them. Granted he said it much more eloquently and with much more tact than that. Essentially, as a Canadian this finally made me realize just how big of a deal it was to Americans. Most importantly why it was important to  them. That for many people it shattered their world view. Which then made me realize just how damaging that is for anyone and everyone.  It has massively helped me cope with my owns life realisations as well. I had typically dismissed erroneous reactions as a character flaw. Now I'm much more aware that people are the sum of their experiences. Nothing ground breaking, nothing changed intellectually, but now I feel it rather than just think it."

"""There are people in this world that dream of having your 'bad days'.""  I was taken aback by that. To think that a bad day for most of us is an argument with a loved one, getting yelled at by a superior at work, or one's car breaking down/phone breaking. Yet if one takes a moment to assess their situation on a deeper level, you'll realize you have a loved one to begin with, you have a paying job, and you have a car/phone/etc. Always helps me put things into perspective."

"While I agree that the German cases maybe hard to understand for a non native and even native speaker, they do serve a purpose. They are intended to make the relation in the sentence clearer.  E.g. A noun in the first case ""Nominativ"" is the subject of the sentece, A noun in the secound case ""Genitiv"" is used to show possesion, objects in a sentence can be of this case, and so on.  Granted one case to rule them all is easier to speak and write but it can be harder to understand without context what is what in a sentence.  All in all I think from an outside perspective every language is kind of bullshit, because as far as I know not one follows and only and truly logical pattern."
"My approach is to tell someone that I cannot possibly imagine what they're going through - empathy is one thing, but for some reason someone saying ""I know how you feel, it'll get better"" just doesn't work for me. So ""I can't imagine what you're going through, but I'm sorry this is happening"" is sometimes way more helpful."

"Well people simplify the issue too much.  Strangers mocking fat strangers for being fat greatly induces stress in the fat people, who turn to food for comfort.  There have been studies that have shown this.  Personally I don't think we should enable overeating, but that isn't the same thing as being an *asshole* to those struggling with overeating.  The absolute best cure for any mental addiction is compassion and understanding.  I do not think it's the place of anyone besides close friends and family and doctors to dictate to anyone how they should be eating.  It is a personal matter.  But those close friends and family should definitely look out for each other and call out self-harming behavior.   But don't tell someone they look ""fine"" if they are grossly overweight either.  If someone asks for opinion, give your real opinion, without being a dick about it.  Say that you're concerned for their health.  EDIT: the reason why I specify why it must be (relatively) close friends is because otherwise, you don't really know *why* the person is fat--could be a really bad disorder they have, could even be a tumor.  Additionally, for all you know, that person could be on a strict regiment *right now*."

The nurse who admitted her just off the bat assumed things about her (friend was in her 20s) and gave her an unsolicited ""diagnosis"" that my friend was drinking and partying too much (which my friend didn't/wasn't). My friend was insulted that someone would assume that and not believe her when she said that's not what happened.  Doc came in and he had her get blood work done.   Turns out she had leukemia. I felt like I wanted to go in and slap that nurse around. I wonder if she ever found out my friend's bruising and weight loss were caused by cancer (probably not).

"Business school, and experience.   Look, here's the blunt truth you won't learn in CS classes: 80% of most ""technology"" problems are actually people/process problems. People tend to do things the way they've always done them, and as they build out processes to handle more complicated things and new things, they tend not to ""go out of the box"" that they've created.   We're not talking about technology startups like reddit. We're talking about traditional companies: banks, medical, manufacturing, retail, etc.  It's not that unusual to get in front of a group of key people (we call them ""stakeholders"") and ask simple questions like, ""How do you process form XYZ?"" or ""How do you put a new server on the data center floor?"", and realize that NONE of them know the complete, end-to-end answer. They've been so laser-focused on their own step in the process that NOBODY has tried to figure out if the process makes any sense at all any more, or what it would take to replace it with a simpler process. If you can be that guy or gal that can run that meeting and solve those problems and build that simplified process while glad-handling the customer through the process of change, even before you write a single line of code, you'll always be in demand.  Here's an illustrative example. Supposed you've got an assembly line running down the middle of a factory. The parts cage is in the middle of the factory at the center of the line. How do you speed up the line?   Now some slick technologist will jump in and talk about inventory modeling and delivering parts to each piece of the line just-in-time and building more cages with a new inventory system, etc. etc. But the business-minded person will ask: ""can we turn the assembly line into a U-shape and put the parts cage in the middle of the U, so each person just turns around and grabs the parts they need and gets back to work?""  That kind of simplistic, almost non-technological process engineering is DESPERATELY needed in all sorts of businesses."

The ground below the fence at the property line dipped down, so a horse could easily clear it.  But the second fence was in my side about 10 feet, above the dip, above the level of most horses.  I learned this when I allowed someone to pasture their horses one year.  The horse broke into the neighbor's back yard and ate their marijuana plants (yum!).  They were very mellow about it - they didn't  call the cops either.  Animal control came out to round up the horses but nobody said anything about the personal grow they had going."

"German is fucking hard. Three genders, but there's no definite way to predict a word's gender (like the way words in spanish end in ""o"" or ""a"").  Then there's a bunch of different ways to pluralize words, but again no standard or definite way to predict how to pluralize.  Then add four cases on top of that, so even when you memorize a word's gender there's like four different possible articles you have to use based on the case.  Really it's just a lot of shit to memorize, so if you don't practice often it's easy to forget, and tough for native english speakers because we don't have gender or case."

"It's hard for me to remember a direct quote from the guy, but back in high school I was very fortunate enough to meet a man who had survived the Hiroshima bomb. It was right at the end of the school year and after exams. I was at the school to dig up an English textbook that they thought I hadn't returned, though it was sitting in the book room. Was there with a friend and we learn that this guy is giving a small presentation in one of the classrooms, so we go to check it out.  Listening to this guy's story was really eye opening. He showed us pictures and maps of where he was when the bomb went off, what he was doing at the time and the building that saved his life. His wife, who was also with us, happened to be in Nagasaki when that bomb was dropped. I don't exactly remember the details but he talked a lot about the fires that raged through the city and the chaos that followed.  You'd think someone who went through this kind of hell would harbor some kind of resentment. But no he's happy to get his story and his message out to a handful of Canadian students willing to listen. Because despite the horrendous events he went through, that atomic bomb saved his life. He was seventeen years old on that day. If the bomb hadn't dropped on Hiroshima, had the Japanese not surrendered the war, he would be dead. He had a mission in three weeks to load a boat full of explosives and crash it into an American ship.  At the end of the day, he viewed the bomb as something that ultimately brought peace to Japan. It's one thing to read about historical events, debate them, and discuss them to their fullest depth but it's entirely different to speak to someone who was actually there and get their perspective.  In the next school year my history teacher used ""Was it right to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima/Nagasaki?"" as an essay question. It's something that's frequently brought up and debated and there's compelling arguments for both sides. It's impossible to judge when so many people were effected in so many different ways.  Ultimately what I got out of meeting this man, hearing his story and having the honor to speak with him, was that absolutely nothing is black and white. It gave me an entirely different outlook on life and world events. Instead of listening to or reading the news and coming up with an opinion, I try to learn as much as I can in order to form a better understanding of what's going on and how it effects people.  As my history teacher always brought up in his classes: History isn't about remembering people, places, dates or events. It's about understanding human nature, and by knowing about the past you get an even greater understanding about what's happening today."

Everything has a currency, wether good or bad, and when I realised the depth to those words it changed my way of thinking"

"The first question is where would an objective morality come from? The next, how could it be proven? If there were one, why are there so many moral systems? What is and is not part of this objective system?  What you feel to be wrong is not what IS wrong, it is a product of your experience, society, and evolution coinciding to create a moral belief system. Take, for example, someone who doesn't think murder is immoral. They're not wrong, that's just not a belief system most of us share because we're taught not to, and generally are empathetic.  However, on the flip side, many who hold that murder is wrong condone warfare and the death penalty. Which are the ending of human life by another human. What makes those activities more moral than a regular murder? If one supports assassination by one government against another? If morality is objective, what objective rule governs murder? If it's all wrong, why are so many willing to bend that rules in order to serve their own interests?  Now, understand that I don't claim to have any answers to these questions. I will never claim that. I'm not sure anyone does, and I hope I didn't come off in a rude way. It's a fair question, despite you getting downvoted, because it's one a lot of people wrestle with.

"I agree with you. I just find Mark Twain's hatred of German humorous. There are things I like and dislike about every language I've studied. Like in French, where you can reply to a negative statement with 'si' and it will unambiguously mean the opposite. For example:  Tu ne vas pas venir ? Si (je vais venir)   You're not going to come? Yes (I am going to come).   A lot of English speakers could understand a single word reply of yes or no to these types of questions as an agreement ('yeah, I don't feel like coming', 'no, I don't feel like coming'), whereas this removes the ambiguity.   But I also hate French pronunciation.   There is no perfect language, and trying to make an organic language (I.e. Non-constructed) logical just doesn't work."

"Hey, do this. Go to the german embassy and ask what is the recommended language school in town. If you're lucky, you'll end up with german teachers in a school that provide the language tests.   When I was 12 I was trying to learn italian, mostly by myself and attending a rather mediocre school, so I lost interest. When I was 18 I decided I had to finish it, at the very least get one of the basic levels. So I went to the italian embassy and they recommended an institute that is provided by L'Università per Stranieri di Siena.  In a few months I'll be doing B2, although I am uncertain if I should go ahead and take on the C2 exams. Sure, I can only go on Saturdays, instead of the recommended weekdays, when speaking, I end up mumbling some, or I say awkwardly organized sentences, but it feels so good having a second and third language.    I've surprised italians living abroad since they don't expect to listen to their tongue from non-italian tourists whenever I'm abroad, they seem happy to speak the language, and that in itself has made my days.   I mean, sure. I'm young. Haven't tasted the bitter half of life yet, so maybe it is easier for me.

"Gonna say a lot of the same. Yeah its a long time, but so what? I'm in my 4th semester and I'll be 30 this week. I was so tired of waking up and realizing where I could be had I actually had the balls to start something. I didnt wanna wake up at 33 or 34 and realize I could be in a whole different world in a life I actually want. What also helps me is instead of thinking ""oh god, Im still 4 years from a masters!"" I think ""Ive still got at best 30 years before I retire!"" I think anyone who goes back so they can do something they enjoy is doing it right. Even if you were 50, you still probably have 20 years before you can quit working (assuming a degree-less job, or just not a good one) so why not spend 4 years of that time making the other 16 great instead of mediocre?   As an aside, if you go back I think youll notice a huge difference in your mindset. It feels a lot easier going back this late because I understand the importance so I actually put in some effort.

"""It's never too late to be who you might have been"" -George Elliot.  A high school teacher wrote this on the board. He said that sometimes we may want to change our life's path; go back to school, start a new company, etc. He then said something to the effect of, no matter where we are in life, 5 years is still 5 years. We can make a new goal and strive for it and possibly reach it in those 5 years, or remain stagnant. If a person is 20, if they're 50, if they're 90, they still have a chance to learn, to grow, to improve."

"You can. That quote is so powerful and meaningful because you know the context. That man suffered for no reason, just because he was what he was. Something he couldn't change. So unfair. The society betrayed him and milions of other Jews. That quote expressed all of this and more. He questioned his own beliefs and the existence of God because of the stuff that happened to him unrightfully. The last part of the quote tells us that what happened to him has no apparent reason, he did nothing so wrong to be punished this hard and as a result as I said he questions the God himself."

"I was with my ex for 7 we broke up 5 years ago.  I still think about her and the relationship.  I've since been with a lot of other people, but she's still there lurking in the back of my mind.  First two years I was self destructive, drinking a lot, drugs, manwhoring.  Leveled off a bit, but still burying feelings.  5 years out, I've finally come to terms with it and mainly myself and my own underlying issues.  It takes strength, determination, and discipline to work on yourself.  It's so easy to just ""cope"" and numb yourself.  It takes true strength to look yourself honestly in the mirror and make the tough changes.  I've done cool shit in the past 5 years, traveled A LOT. Lived on a beach for a year in Costa Rica.  Traveled through Colombia for a couple months.  Sailed through an archipelago for a week.  Snowboarded in Switzerland, and a bunch of other shit.  Even though I enjoyed myself, something was still ""missing"".  It was my sense of love for myself.  I've been actively working out/running hard the past 6 months.  Eating better, started mediating recently, taking adult education classes.  basically doing stuff to better myself.  It helps.  The worst thing to do is to be idle.  Your mind will fuck with you.

"Long post ahead, but it's good in my eyes.  I understand the moral importance of having integrity and being honest, but in my view cheating on a test really ain't that bad. I mean first of all, it depends on the test and where you are in the world. It also depends on your age, if you are a fifteen year old and you're in highschool then cheating on a test won't make a large difference. If you're an adult and you're in for a test on first aid to get certification you better fucking know what you are doing.  Some may say you compromise your morals by cheating on a highschool test, but half of those fuckers probably are unaware of how fucked up the education system is in North America. From a logical standpoint it does not make sense to memorize dates and find out that the mitochrondia is the powerplant of the cell when you could be doing something far more important. If you have the opportunity to devote time to something more relevant to your overall life **and** still get great marks on your chemistry exam, a logical decision would say you should go against the grain.  Also if you are still not convinced that doing this is morally correct, you must also evaluate if your school/institution has more morally correct rules. If you follow the rules and they are not morally correct, how can you keep your integrity? For me at least, and this will change depending on your location around the world, I was enrolled in a 'christian' highschool that preached that drugs were sinful and that sinners needed help. Come the time when a druggie in my class was found out, he was expelled. The contradictions within telling children to help sinners and then once one is found out taking the action of exiling them to another school (most likely a public one, with no christian morals) are simply dumbfounding. At the graduation ceremony all the adults had wine, which was odd as most people who have thought about Alcohol know that it is simply a legalized drug and is in fact more hazardous than marijuana. Contradictions such as this compromise the morals of a school and I have many more examples of moral corruption in my schools that border on lunacy.  The distinction between rules of a school or government and moral principles ought to be separated with care. I do not view cheating on a test for a socials class as morally corrupt because morals larger than a few dates on a paper. I do not think that cheating on a test corrupts your 'soul' or your being, it just means you have a different outlook on life. Still I can understand how cheating could bring habits that are negative. Thus the defining difference between someone who studies religiously and someone that cheats religiously is the man who decides that learning is important but (depending on the material) not always important. The defining difference is discipline, the discipline to evaluate what is important to learn and then make an educated assessment of what he devotes his time to. If a man has no time to read books because he is always studying drivel, could he not sacrifice time of study in an effort to become more literate? And in this mans case of sacrificing time of study to an unimportant subject, so that he may actually learn something of value through a book, is it morally corrupt? Is it morally corrupt to sacrifice time devoted useless information in an effort to truly learn? Is it morally correct to sacrifice actual education in the interest of better grades?  My goal here is not to convince you, but rather for you to give a moment of thought to your fathers words."

But to be honest, discipline can ebb and flow as well. Some days you feel like crap and go anyway, other days ... you cede defeat and stay on the couch.  One way or another, it's about mental tricks. You have to set yourself up for success, forge a routine, a trigger-behavior-reward structure, visualize or imagine progress/ the benefits, and a hundred other things.  It's not just ...

You have been in a relationship so long that being single can be scary. You don't have anybody to lean on for support and you may feel lost. I've been there. Just realise that you can now experience tons of things that have not been acceptable when you were in a relationship. You now have true freedom meaning you don't have to answer to anybody and you can make decisions based on what YOU want to do without having to check with anybody to make sure it's ok. Good luck and stay strong. After the numbness fades there will be a period of time when you want to text him or hang out with him just so you can return to your comfort zone. If you can push through the urge during that period you will come out a different person and only then can you truely evaluate if you are compatible with that person.

"There's a couple of reasons Spanish can be considered easier to speak if you already know English whereas it is harder to speak English if you know Spanish.  1. English is made up of mostly Greek and Latin roots. Spanish is made up of mostly Latin roots. So when you are learning Spanish and you know English, you already have an understanding of some Latin roots, this goes a long way in helping you learn. When you know Spanish and are learning English, you only know the Latin roots and still have to learn the Greek ones.  2. English has a lot of tricky words and some words that have more than one meaning. As well as odd rules for pronouncing them. For example the I before E  except after (I don't remember it haha, not native English speaker). Spanish has the accent marks that help you pronounce different words. Spanish also helps you distinguish between two similarly spelled words with accent marks. English does not have this. For example saw and saw.    This is all I can think of off the top of my head but hopefully this helps understand the reasons why most English speakers consider Spanish an easy language to pick up."

"Some /r/askreddit question about ""what's holding you back? what's your greatest weakness? etc.""  I admitted that depression fucking sucks, and went into detail about how every day feels.  Hint:  not good, not suicidal, but probably wouldn't have been terribly upset to die in a freak accident.  The response was overwhelming.  I *deserve* to feel and live like normal people, it's *not* alright or something that can I can ""tough it out"", and there are people out there who are more than willing to help.  Seriously, if anyone out there is suffering from depression, talk to a nurse or doctor.  Even if you're used to it and not suicidal.  They'll take you seriously, still.  It's not as scary as it first seems, and whatever meds they give you don't ""change"" you like I first thought.  They just make things more manageable, which really, really helps.  I love you guys."

"Semi-relevant, but you sound a lot like me. Apologetic, with a tinge of self-hate for bothering people for your own problems and inconsistencies – ""I'm a functioning human being, why can't I deal with my problems on my own?"" I feel that a lot. Like, a substantial amount of my life is spent worrying about how much I drag people down around me because of my mannerisms. It hurts a lot, but that's just who I am. Thankfully, I read something a while ago that's changed that a great deal (and I'm shamelessly stealing from this comic, I'll post it when I'm home later tonight and not on mobile) was to *just stop saying sorry*. If you do feel the urge to apologize for something you've done, say thank you instead. ""Sorry for rambling"" turns into ""thank you for listening,"" and both you and your friends are better off for it. Your friends feel rewarded for caring about you, and you feel like you haven't ended your conversation with another burden on them, so you feel a hell of a lot better yourself. I guarantee you're a good enough person if you have friends out there willing to listen to you and give perspective on your life's issues, so hopefully this helps you become a happier person in the end.

That's what changed it all, the fact that he was more upset that I was screwing around doing stupid reckless shit when I had so many people who loved and cared about me rather than angry at me for almost being an enabler of sorts, for not thinking his brothers problem was bigger than it was. Everything changed after that, how I viewed everything I was doing, how I was essentially a scum bag not worth shit.  My life two years ago and my life today are very, very different."

"It was a random moment, I had to take my cat to the vet.   In the waiting room there was a bunch of people waiting with their animals, some random guy out of no where struck up a conversation, I can't remember what we were talking about, but he said something along the lines of,  ""Don't live in debt, don't be a slave to owning money to someone else. You will live to work to pay someone else your money""  The comment was profound, and I'm not sure what led him to that saying it but it struck a cord. I was multiple credit cards in debt, car loan, bike loan, student loans, I was crawling in debt. Since he said that I looked at money in a different way, in the last year I have resorted to living like a hermit but I managed to pay down all my credit card debt, and paid off and sold my bike. I still have the car loan and student loans, but both are at levels that won't sink me and I consider them necessary. I have a better financial outlook now, than I did before I incurred any debt and got smart with my finances.  I can only explain it in a way that I felt that some how God was sending me a message. It struck me, and stuck with me in that way that forever changed my life."

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet.

He told me it would be challenging, and I agreed that it would, but that I was willing to give it a go anyway. Later on I had a feedback talk with my teacher, and I could just feel her asking the leading questions about what I wanted to do, if I had been considering a-levels, and so forth. I don't know if it's true, but I think that the study counsellor told the other teachers what we'd been talking about. So in the end I just decided to indulge her curiosity, and she told me ""Well, I don't think you'll be able to do those courses, you should make a bit easier for yourself"". I got the message of what she was trying to say, but it came across so condescending. Contrary to the quote though, I think she could do that math.  Anyhow, I finished A-levels, and passed all the math-courses. And I'm now studying Computer Science. Still not the best at math, but I did it."

"Quote from my high school wrestling gym: Pain is temporary, pride is forever  Whenever I feel like my body or mind can't take any more, I remind myself that the pain will eventually go away and one day I will be sitting on my couch again, all nice and cozy....however, the chance to capture the moment, to make something memorable that I can look back on one day...that's only in this moment right now  The amazing thing about this is that whenever I tell myself this, it's like a painkiller going through my body and I actually feel more capable again. Hope I never forget this one"

"once when I was very little a bunch of black teenagers beat the shit out of me for no reason other then I was white.

At this point I am ashamed because I did not see him until after I said all those nasty things. So I walked over to the man. I was looking down. He picked me up. sat me on his knee wiped my tears away.and said something I will never forget. ""Son, those kids have been told their whole lives that because of the color of their skin they are treated with disrespect. they don't know what real racism is like but they act out because of what they have been told. So I understand why you feel that way but I for one know what they did was wrong and you would be just as bad as them if you keep hating them.""

"Beliefs are one thing. Judging others for their beliefs is another.  To me it's crazy to be absolutely certain that there's something more than the material world, and it's just as crazy to be absolutely certain that there's nothing else, that this is all there is. Untestable hypotheses are just that. But most people need certainty.  Beliefs aren't usually the problem. Certainty isn't usually the problem. Judgment is a big part of the problem, but only part. The root of the problem is identifying with one's beliefs. ""My beliefs are right and yours are wrong"" is the source of much conflict only because it's a personal affront.  ""I am Christian"" or ""I am Muslim"" is much more dangerous than ""I like Jesus"". Phrasing it like that it's clear (to me, anyway) that most of what we call religion has nothing to do with religious belief. It's tribal bullshit."
"""Don't ask, don't get"". An older co-worker of mine was being interviewed for a promotion I thought I was not qualified for.

I walked out of his office with a new role and a big raise, his parting word's to me: ""Don't ask, don't get"". This tactic should be used in consideration of the circumstance. That said, you should always ask yourself ""what's the worst that could happen by asking"""

"I'm near impossible to offend, but I appreciate your concern and thank you for it. Also I agree in general Christians are more accepting, especially compared to back in the times you've mentioned. I might have been a bit dramatic pulling all of Christianity into this but locally there was a huge anti-homosexuality push by many churches a few years ago that drove people away.   Also the churches around here are very different than to those I've been apart of in the past. Back then it was more like ""here is a passage and what we can learn from it"" and the churches I've been to around here were more like ""here is a social issue and why it needs to stop."" It's not all bad but that one sermon just really blew my mind especially at how well received it was. So I guess a better realization would be that I had no idea how different the practices of different areas could be, it was unfair of me to blanket all of Christianity.   Edit: formatting"
"I agree.  When I travel I try to learn a few basics before I go if I have time.  I recently got into a discussion here about how Americans deal with traveling to non-English speaking countries.  I was roundly criticised for saying that I can go nearly anywhere in the world and get around without speaking the local language.  This is because nearly anywhere I go I can find a way to communicate, whether it be gesturing, using a phrasebook to translate, or even seeking out English speaking locals.  Do I prefer to do this?  No.  I would much rather have some basic understanding of the local language.  But I am not afraid of going there.  This is important.  Too many Americans are afraid of travelling overseas because of communication concerns.  They are accustomed to being able to talk to locals and terrified at the thought of not being understood.  This fear keeps them from traveling and learning about other cultures.  I encourage Americans to travel regardless of if they can speak even a few words.  Once immersed in the culture they can pick up the basics and gain a respect for life beyond our borders."

I stopped giving a shit about petty things after that and realized that sure, I could save aggressively for retirement and all that, but then I'd be missing out on lots of great experiences.

"Prior to hurricaine Bob in the mid nineties.    I was vacationing on long island with my parents. I was probably 10.   We went to a town called greenport.  They have a 200 year old clippers ship, and when we approached it, it was towed about 30 feet off its normal resting place, with the fire department running hoses to it from shore. They were filling it with water to sink it.   I asked him why. He said "" she will get smashed to pieces against the dock.  Out there, on the bottom of the bay, she will be safe. We can always raise the ship again. Sometimes you have to sink the ship to save it"".

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.... this is the one that's hitting me the hardest
"I got you:   ""Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.  This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.  Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket.""  But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.  He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.  No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.  So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...  But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:  ""Today you.... tomorrow me.""  Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.  In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:  ""Today you.... tomorrow me."""""

"When I was a kid I entered some local tourny feeling badass. I got destroyed.  Learned a very good lesson.  Even in working life, I've seen cockyness destroy a person, or at least humiliate them. When I was a new lawyer it was really intimidating going into some deposition or court hearing against a seasoned guy.  So, scared to death, I'd over-prepare and familiarize myself with everything about my case.  The seasoned guy felt no need to prepare beyond glancing at his paperwork at breakfast.   Then get very shocked during the hearing or deposition over some issue he overlooked.  I once had an attorney for the FBI get so furious (because he could not stop a line of questioning I was asking his star witness) that he actually threw a pencil so hard down on the desk it bounced at hit me. He demanded a recess.  He takes me aside and very angrily asks where I'm going with this line of questioning. I tell him doesn't really matter and if he wants to object, do it on the record.  He outright tells me, ""Well, I can't stop you from asking her these questions, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT!""  Huh? So I was just gonna stop? The ""I don't like it"" objection!"

"Let me be perfectly clear. I do not for one second believe that any god exists, especially benevolent all-powerful ones. That is as implausible an idea as you can get.

You can tell them where you are and how you got there, but they've probably got a different starting point so your directions won't do much good until they get close on their own."
"It really isn't.  When people keep repeating something, such as ""could of"" instead of the proper ""could have"", then it's easy to pick up.  I'm not a native speaker, but I used to think that ""could of"" is a correct/casual phrase, because a lot of people say it, so naturally I'd say it too."

"&gt; To doubt is to question, and to question is to push our humanity. And knowing that the atheist debating me doubts his belief just as much as me, gives me confidence to keep believing until otherwise disproved.  Uh. Being frank. Atheism pretty much means, ""doubt"" in a lot of ways. A literal translation is ""without god"" but it means ""without belief in god."" I hope this doesn't come off as mocking, but I doubt unicorns or cthulhu exist. Scientifically speaking there is no reason to assume something exist until it is demonstrated/proven. I have no doubt that doubting god is a logical stance because it's the default for so many things. I doubt ghost, bigfoot, UFOs, and many other things. I simply have no reason to do anything other than doubt them until someone provides proof.  &gt;ting me doubts his belief just as much as me, gives me confidence to keep believing until otherwise disproved. There is just as much ""proof"" that people accept that God exists as there is the Big Bang, nirvana, or any other belief. Believe something that is unbelievable because everyone believes something unbelievable.   Pretty sure this is a  fallacy. (it is at the very least incorrect) We can actually view other universes moving away from eachother and we can infer that on a time scale the universe was once compressed to one point if we go back far enough. This isn't ""unbelievable"" in the sense that it literally can not be believed but it is ""unbelievable"" in the sense that it is hard to actually process because we live such short lives and  are so small. Still, it has actually been in many ways proven.  Evolution has without a doubt been proven and it challenges Genesis right from the beginning of the bible. While some people argue that it's just suppose to be ""symbolism"" and ""metaphor"" and ""not taken literally."" If that is the case then why take anything in the bible literally? Heck IIRC the bible didn't even have the most accurate estimate of pi at the time it was written which doesn't bode well for the idea it is divinely inspired."

"I always thought it was funny how most people who claim to be atheists either don't know what the term means, or are just as unable to prove their beliefs as someone who believes any religion.   Atheists say there is no God and state that as a provable fact. Theists believe in some deity but require faith as they can't prove it. Atheists can't prove that no God exists because there will always be things we do not know, to be able to prove without a doubt that God exists means you must be able to explain everything.  Basically you can't disprove the idea of an all knowing God without becoming all knowing yourself."

So the conclusion is we would give this homeless straight answer that we're not okay.  And when I personally deal with Americans or Canadians, I need to be overenthusiastic, otherwise they have wrong impression that I'm sad or something if I respond that ""I'm okay"" because for them ""okay"" means ""meh"".   American living in Poland wrote:  &gt; Americans and Brits are sometimes so indirect that it’s cringe-worthy. If you’ve ever heard “excuse me, but would it be possible if I could maybe just a little bit…”, you know what I’m talking about. Poles get to the point faster. I don’t think it’s a problem but sometimes it can be uncomfortable in situations like e.g. I get a text that just says “ok”. With Americans, if you send a message like that, you know someone is pissed. It should be more like, “ok sure no problem”. That’s us agreeing not once, but 3 times for good measure. In Poland, they’re just agreeing. Once is enough I guess? This also proves our tendency to exaggerate. Nothing is good, everything is great/fantastic/spectacular. In Poland, ok means just that. In our house we regularly ask each other, “Polish ok or American ok?” Meaning, it is good (Polish ok) or just eh (American ok). Meaning the statement, “you look ok”, can have two quite different meanings depending on which of us says it.  More: http://polonization.pl/are-we-so-different-poles-vs-americans/"

"When I was a tween I got in trouble in school. I was at that age where I was just starting to learn that other people had different opinions about things and those opinions were just as valid as my own, but my brain hadn't quite wrapped its head around that yet.  The one good thing my Dad ever did for me was the day after I'd gotten in trouble. I was suspended for 3 days from school because of the incident and my mom had to work (I lived with her) so she reluctantly asked my dad to watch me, to which he agreed.  We spent the day hanging out but not really doing much. I brought my Xbox over and spent most of the day playing that or reading, with sporadic interaction with him in between, not on purpose but just because neither of us were the type of person to actively ""hang out"" in this sort of situation. We were starting to grow apart at the time and I think we both knew it.  Anyway, we went out for an early dinner before he went to drop me back off at my mom's place. While we were having dinner and chatting about whatever, he brought up what had happened at school to get me suspended. I'm paraphrasing only slightly here:  ""I'm not going to get onto you for what you did. Plenty of people already have. I know you understand why it was wrong and I'm sure you won't do it again, but I am gonna give you some advice. Just leave people alone, man. Let them live their lives and they'll let you live yours. Don't be a jerk, help out when you can, but otherwise just leave people be.""  I told him I would and I always have. It's worked out for me pretty well so far."

"&gt;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.  &gt;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.  &gt;In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.  &gt;The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones."

You were smart enough to get good grades and that was enough for you. That's fine. Odds are, you'll be able to coast through life if that's all you want to do. But I encourage you to try. For yourself, not for anyone else. You'll surprise yourself with what you can accomplish when you try for more than just enough."" That advice has served me well since.

"I was a pretty insecure teen usually worrying if I looked ok and wondering what people thought of me.  At some point in those years I heard someone say that everyone was pretty much caught up in the same thinking and that nobody was thinking about me because they were too worried about themselves.     It was freeing and changed me a lot.  I raised my daughter with that thinking and she is way more self assured then I ever was.  Not sure if it is connected, but it didn't hurt I suspect.  Edited: readability"
"No doubt a lot is from experience and maturing, but I notice part of it is where the funding comes from.   When you are 30+, you are less likely to have funding support from your family so you have to make it count.   The other big difference I noticed was writing skills. The &lt;25 year olds have terrible professional written communication skills. It is so bad it was concerning."
"Only if you're already under the assumption that there's a linear and stable relationship between practice put in and results. The other side is that people who have a better relationship and feedback mechanism with activities also tend to do them more. It wouldn't be all that odd if people who continually got very poor improvement feedback from activities would be a lot less likely to do them. This isn't a universal rule but it would explain a lot of trends.  There are not too many studies on the subject, but there was a chess study made by Gobet et. al. which had some people reach the same level after 3k hours and some not reach it after 27k hours.  http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/deliberate-practice-necessary-but-not-sufficient.html http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hambrick-et-al.-2013.pdf  The famous 10k rule was based on a pretty poorly controlled study where before they did anything they already picked out only violinists who could go to a special musician school. Most people don't care about differences between various talented musicians and various talented athletes. They care about the difference between them and said talented musician or talented athlete.  Honestly, I'm not sure why people hold on to the idea that genetics don't matter so much. It doesn't make much sense for them to not matter given how stark differences can be between, say, different species. Why is it impossible to have variety within humans themselves? Why can't people have different affinities and learn different things at different speeds?"
"And I liked Eckhart Tolle talking about thinking being a drug, the strongest one.  Since then I let myself be in state of not thinking and it feels amazingamazing."
"It was said to me this way: ""Never say you are sorry for being late,  Instead thank the person for being patient""  I have taken the root of this to be ""Be positive"".   I think that whenever I was instructed told to ""Be positive"" before I thought what was meant was to always be cheerful and annoyingly upbeat.  when I heard the phrase as said above I realized it means to appreciate the good aspect of the situation and acknowledge it over focusing on and drawing attention to the negative."
"Same thing happens to me sometimes, you know a good way to deal with it? Have you ever watched Wreck It Ralph? The main character's final conclusion is: ""If that kid likes me, how bad can I be?"".

Instead of getting angry about the situation that you are in, just say ""This is what I'm doing now"" and forget about what you would rather be doing, because what you would rather be doing is just causing you stress about being where you are NOW.

"My first language(s?) was Tagalog and I also spoke English as a child. But at home we always spoke Tagalog. By the time I came to the US when I was 6, I was fluent in both. I went to pretty prestigious Catholic school for elementary and middle and had been learning Spanish since I was in the 2nd grade and could carry a normal conversation with anyone by 6th/7th (couldn't read Cervantes or anything though ahaha.) In high school, I tried to learn German and it was the most confusing thing I tried to learn. Apparently it's pretty simple to pick up if you speak English, but it was impossible for me, even if I was fluent in English. I was mostly trying to link words in Spanish and Tagalog to German but was having the hardest time.   I guess moral of the story is that the level of difficulty when learning a language is based on what your native tongue and the language you ""think"" in and when you're young you pick up learning anything ahaha"

"It's like that story about the starfish:  &gt;“Once upon a time, there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.  &gt;One day, as he was walking along the shore, he looked down the beach and saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought of someone who would dance to the day, and so, he walked faster to catch up.  &gt;As he got closer, he noticed that the figure was that of a young man, and that what he was doing was not dancing at all. The young man was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.  &gt;He came closer still and called out ""Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?""  &gt;The young man paused, looked up, and replied ""Throwing starfish into the ocean.""  &gt;""I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?"" asked the somewhat startled wise man.  &gt;To this, the young man replied, ""The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die.""  &gt;Upon hearing this, the wise man commented, ""But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can't possibly make a difference!""  &gt;At this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said,  ""It made a difference for that one.”   Google tells me it was written by Loren Eiseley."

Generally speaking  Abrahamic religions are anti-homosexual.  &gt;It's not all bad but that one sermon just really blew my mind especially at how well received it was. So I guess a better realization would be that I had no idea how different the practices of different areas could be, it was unfair of me to blanket all of Christianity  Being anti-theist I think this is one thing thats frustrating to try to get a lot of people to understand. It's so easy to run into people who don't understand just how negative churches can be. People go to their own church which is a major deviation from what is instructed, focus on the love aspects, then assume everyone else does too."

Certainly. Religion is a platform for beliefs. It does a lot of good in our world but also a lot of bad. As long as you don't use it as a platform for bad things I've got no qualms for you specifically. But a person can certainly be moral without having to be religious.

"The programmer that writes his or her own square root is wasting the company's time and their own, and exposing the company to needless risk as they may fail to address edge cases that result in errors or security problems down the line. The same is true for many items on that list; who writes their own string to integer parser? The programming languages have been developed for decades to address all the potential edge cases in string to numeric conversion.  Even implementing your own sort is fraught with potential problems; if you're programming for the real world you better have a DAMN GOOD reason you're not using the programming language's thoroughly tested and carefully implemented sort methods. (Although I'll admit there may be rare, specific business cases where it would be useful to code your own.)  I mean, seriously. ""Check if String is a palindrome""? Unless you're coding to make crossword puzzles, these are not business problems. They're not even engineering problems.   Yes, of course, these questions may be indicative of *general* coding capability, and that will be valuable, but whether somebody can detect a palindrome does not tell you if they can flow chart a pharmacy inventory system that makes a lick of sense, and that's the problem that really needs to be solved.  What would I do? I'd put in front of them a process workflow that the business uses today, and I'd introduce some quasi-obvious edge cases and errors, and then ask them to build a proposal that would (1) fix errors &amp; manual re-work in this process, (2) improve this process, and (3) automate it. If they can't answer (1) or (2) they probably won't come up with anything intelligent for (3)."

The other is an accusation, as in, Hey, you're not being responsible for other people's feelings, but you ought to be.  There are many areas in life where I technically or legally have no responsibility, but I'm a human being with free will and a little bit of this thing called compassion, so I'll *assume responsibility*.

Eventually he stops and he says ""You know whats weird?"" I asked him what was weird, and he says ""We used to play catch like this every single day, and now we don't. Think of it like this...in the next ten times you play catch, one of those times will probably be with your kid.""

The last thing she did was light sandalwood incense.   When my grandparents come in everyone hugs and says it's great to see each other (even though we saw them every day, and were damn happy to not be living with them still). Everyone settles in and finds a place to sit, gets a drinks...you know, as family does when they come over. My grandfather is pretty gruff and outspoken normally, but he comes over to me and sits really close.   He says really quietly, ""Do you know what that smell is?""   I said, ""You mean the incense?

"In the military you deal with so much bullshit, that you either laugh 95% of it off and keep on going, or you fall out.   A lot of people would say things like ""Shit happens"", but I coined the phrase ""Life sucks. Get over it."" Sometimes a laugh would accompany it, sometimes a really disappointed face. This basically became one of my mottos since then.   While that isn't something that'll cheer someone up, it allowed me to express to myself that yes, the situation sucks balls, but there is nothing I can do to change it, so I either push myself to get through said shitty situation, or I fallout and give up (and I'm to damn stubborn to give up).   It's sort of a reality check and advice all in one phrase lol."

I imagine the difference between us is you felt the love when your mom said it. My mom had heard someone say it on tv and felt the need to share the wisdom out of nowhere. It fed straight into my feelings of worthlessness. I know she loves me but she's always been awful at expressing it.

"Children are tiny little sociopaths who literally don't have a strong grip on the idea that other people are just as alive inside as they are.   Caring about other people presupposes being able to conceive of them as *being* people, in the fully-fledged ""has thoughts and feelings and needs of their own"" sense, and not just existing to fill a role in your world.  Hell, empathy isn't *easy* even as an adult. Your brain can only keep track of so many people as full humans before it starts resorting to treating some people as background objects, stereotypes and caricatures."

But anyways I was talking to friend who I think is really good at playing the Piano. I told him learning to play the piano is hard, I see so little progress in the 2 years I've been learning.  He told me that to keep at it because even the pros that he's met also complain about their skills.  Anyways so I commented, ""well it comes natural to you."" He immediately said, ""you mean my 15 years of practice, and many many many hours that I put into it? The large sums of money to hire coaches and go to pros to improve my skills? You have been at it half assed for 2 years and you expect to be a pro?""  He was right. I wanted to be as good as he was, without putting the same amount of time and effort. Mostly the time."

"The key things here are not mechanical failures (necessarily).

"I know I'm late but everyone should know this. My Dad told me this when I was a teen and it's the best advice you could EVER have (IMO). *Guaranteed*.  Quick but engaging story. So through teen years, I found it hard to understand I hanged about with bad company (like I was loyal to my homies or something) and was very judgemental and racist to some degree. I used to talk to my dad while he was on delivery trips from his Job and he'd get the gist of my problems when I spoke about my day. So one day, I was spouting remarks on the loud behaviour of black people and how they are like animals. He said-   &gt;No, don't say that. I have black people as my customers everyday, they always kind and very funny to me. Don't think some people are bad. Even your friends can be bad.**There is good and bad in everyone**.   Stupid me didn't get it at first. But it stuck there and the more I contemplated on it, I just kept realising how damn correct he was. Freinds, girls, anyone. No one was perfect, good people have bad and bad people have good and we are all as fucked as each other. I began to mix with people more, I wasn't selective and stubborn with people choice and became much happier because of it.    Now, this idea is my philosophy. I go by it day by day and it only gets more true. I truly am much less judgemental for it. Thanks, Dad.  P.S. I love black people."
"I decided to go to counselling once when I was going through a bad break-up.

"My grandmother went back to school when she was about 73 to get an English degree just because she wanted something to do. She's a lifelong learner, and the students she took classes with thought it was amazing to see someone her age still so eager to gain more knowledge. She was a retired Salvation Army officer (Salvation Army equivalent of a pastor), took a Women in Religion course, and ended up doing a lecture of female leaders in the Salvation Army's formative years that was later added to the syllabus. That always amazed me, how someone I had known my whole life was able to do something like that. Might not seem very much of a big deal, but I think it's pretty good.  You're never too old to start."

"It's more like motivation works for some people when they decide it to rename it to something else because they don't actually understand motivation and confuse it with direct inspiration.  Anything that makes you do anything is motivation. Period. The rest is misuse of terms. Feeling like crap doesn't mean you have 0 motivation. It just means you don't have as much. Motivation may also be a lot more longtitudal, i.e., preparing for something over a year is different vs doing something any given day. Longtitudal motivation I'm pretty sure is how people actually do things. I can't do anything if I don't see some sort of point in it, can you? One problem these days is that people ""want"" things someone else told them to want, not what they want.  A person with 0 motivation will do nothing, in the extreme case this is a high level of akrasia and depression and there's something very broken with their brain at that point. They're not going to react to motivational posters. Often they don't care about whatever goals other people are trying to tell them exist.  ""Disciplined"" people are just more motivated in certain aspects, and often not for good reasons. A lot of ""disciplined"" people are motivated by things like fear of failure and perfectionism, put in from early harsh parenting, or from the military. They're strong motivators but they're also poison.  At times, that beats having normal (low) levels of motivation. But it could eat into you. Pick your poison, I guess. A lot of highly successful people hate themselves. Extreme personal motivation is not really normal. Some of the best motivators are unhealthy, getting a gun put to your head.  Another good motivator is religious systems and generally any ritualized and organized structures. Dojo's, teams, churches, schools, etc. It's also why having other people helps a lot: another person may give you the motivation you simply cannot cultivate yourself, like it or not. Some people are much better at self-motivation, some really thrive with a mentor. And sometimes those who thrive with a mentor never get a mentor.  What ""it takes"" honestly depends on the person, not on some sort of wishy washy magical power of will. It's a soup of hopes and fears and experiences (including trauma) and base willpower and base motivations and how your brain is acting up this particular way and how much you love or hate the activity and so on. It's complicated, and what's worse, it's not the same for everyone. Motivation is kind of the discussion of the purpose of man after a while.  Human motivation is one of the most complex things out there. Trying to simplify it down to just renaming terms shows an utter lack of understanding of the material."

"My brother was battling cancer and had to have a bone marrow transplant. He would have to come spend two months with me because the town he was  getting treatment in didn't have a hospital that did the procedure. I was fresh out of college living in what was essentially bachelor pad. We had a regular at the restaurant I was working at, Dr. J, who always asked about my brother's progress. When I told him about the next step he stopped me mid sentence and says to me ""your family is staying with me."" He insisted because he lived out in the country, on a lake and it would be very peaceful, refusing any sort of compensation. Not to mention my mom and brother would have privacy because they would be staying in the mother-in-law suite that was separate from the home. It brought tears to my eyes and I couldn't stop thanking him. Dr. J then says to me:   ""There's no need to thank me. It's an honor to do good.""   Those words will ring with me forever.  That man and his wife are some of the most caring and altruistic humans I know."

"&gt;In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When human beings are governed by ‘thou shalt not’, the individual can practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly governed by ‘love’ or ‘reason’, he is under continuous pressure to make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else. The Houyhnhnms, we are told, were unanimous on almost all subjects. The only question they ever discussed was how to deal with the Yahoos. Otherwise there was no room for disagreement among them, because the truth is always either self-evident, or else it is undis-coverable and unimportant. They had apparently no word for ‘opinion’ in their language, and in their conversations there was no ‘difference of sentiments’. They had reached, in fact, the highest stage of totalitarian organization, the stage when conformity has become so general that there is no need for a police force. Swift approves of this kind of thing because among his many gifts neither curiosity nor good-nature was included. Disagreement would always seem to him sheer perversity. ‘Reason,’ among the Houyhn-hnms, he says, ‘is not a Point Problematical, as with us, where men can argue with Plausibility on both Sides of a Question; but strikes you with immediate Conviction; as it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured by Passion and Interest.’ In other words, we know everything already, so why should dissident opinions be tolerated? The totalitarian Society of the Houyhnhnms, where there can be no freedom and no development, follows naturally from this.  ~George Orwell  The idea that a society without law could be more oppressive than one with law led to me rethinking a lot of my political views and making piece with the establishment."

"Were you taught about it by a teacher?   Maybe they didn't use the right explanation for you, weren't that good at explaining, or just skipped the explanation part entirely?  Were you informed of it by a fellow student?   Maybe they didn't grasp it themselves, and therefore weren't that good at explaining it?   Maybe they thought they should ""show off"" (while thinking that they understood it), and _wanted_ it to sound complicated and dumb?  .  I can't remember when I first heard about it, but if I remember correctly I thought it was an overly complicated way of describing a concept. Also, if I remember correctly, there were no accompanying explanations given.  This is probably not a good explanation of _Platon's cave_ (and maybe not even close to correct?), but it's my improvised attempt:  You know how some films are based off a book, or a series of books.   At times, it's too expensive, or not even possible, to picture all events from the book/s (even though today's techniques are way better than those availabe just a few decades ago), so they're left out.   At other times, those making the film wants stuff added in (because they didn't like the original story, or because it wasn't do-able, or because they've got a picky sponsor) that weren't present in the book/s.  .  In _Plato's cave_, the ""full picture"" is a series of books,   but the film is in black-and-white, and made in the silent film era (so there's no spoken dialogue), and only covers the first 1½ books.   In this case, the film may be good, but to _get_ the full picture it's better to read the books."
"Absofuckinglutely.  I'm a piano player. I've played my entire life, I even came into college majoring in it. I'm still a terrible pianist.  Why? Because I just wasn't willing to put in the time and effort it took to go from being an ok piano player to being a great one. However, I know that I'm a fairly talented musician--I pick up new things quickly and have a good ear. I just plain did not enjoy playing the piano very much so I didn't put any effort in. (Although the happy ending is that I found an instrument that I absolutely love and don't mind putting in long hours practicing on it, so my music ability hasn't gone totally to waste.)  Talent has nothing to do with anything. The way you get good at something is to do it until it becomes second nature."

I was terribly frustrated at the time so during a break I told one of my favorite teachers about it who was also helping run the camp. I said, ""I don't understand why I don't have the patience for this, I am so frustrated."" She replies with, ""Anger is the root of impatience."" I blew it off at the time and walked away. I didn't realize until an hour later that what she had said was true. It completely changed how I go about handling problems and I am a better person for it."

I had done all that was asked of me for it, I deserved it. But we were running late or something or he tired, I don't remember but that sentence hit me like a pile of bricks. It seriously shattered my 4 year old perception of reality. I was a pretty rational 4 year old as far as things go, and I had always previously operated under the assumptions that promises were like contracts, they couldn't be broken. That everyone had a system of give and take, do and recieve. I remember going quiet in the back of the seat and just mulling over how much my world had changed due to a sentence. So if someone promised me something ...they could just break it? No consequences? No follow up? What was the point in promises? I could work hard and not be rewarded? What was the point in even trying? Why even bother? What was the point in living?  Tl;Dr My mind went to some dark places  for a 4 year old after broken promises of hard earned ice cream.

"Every action of your life touches on some chord that will vibrate in eternity.   This was written as the ""quote of the day"" from a teacher I had when I was in 10th grade. I think about this nearly everyday and how the smallest actions we take can result in something big down the line and really changed the way I looked at life. The most important thing about this quote is that this particular teacher is hated by just about everyone, including myself, but that quote that was written on the board that morning is something I'll never forget."

But if I may point out that  A)  a big part of being a Christian is to have your wrong deeds forgiven and B) another big part of being a Christian is to love unconditionally and if you're only calling yourself a Christian for point A and skipping point B, I would say you rant following Jesus's teachings and there for NOT a Christian."

"In high school I was sitting on the bleachers by the exit during an open gym and someone was coming in with a box in their hands. I don't remember if they were struggling with the door or what but my gym teacher quickly told me to get over there and help them. As a spoiled brat I was mad she made me look stupid in front of everyone, but after she stopped me and said. ""Never pass up the chance to help someone no matter how small it seems."" it's nothing huge but eight years later I still think of it often and try to help people who could use a hand when ever I can."
I don't agree. My friends and I rib each other for all sorts of things we can't control (e.g. going bald). It totally comes from a place of jest. There's no malice.
"This is a sad truth I've come to realize about many people. Does it make them less responsible for their actions? I don't know, but I still want to help them ""see the light""."
"Yeah, I mean you just described a situation in which they did hurt the person's feelings.  But they're not the cause *just because that person says so* they are the cause because they actually are the cause in that situation. There are other situations in which someone can say you hurt them, but that person is wrong.  So the point is, its not always up to the person who is hurt to determine the truth.  There are many situations in which someone else hurt their feelings or they hurt their own feelings and are taking that out on you. There are some people out there who are upset by ludicrous things like someone else being gay.  There are some people out there who are upset by anything and everything because they want to be upset or want to be a victim. If they're going around getting upset at random things all day, I'm not the cause, they are. Just because they say I'm the cause does not make it true, there is an actual cause, and its not me.  I think the quote is bad because it kind of makes it an absolute that we can't use our brains to determine whether something is really the cause of something else, but have to accept that everyone who claims something hurt their feelings is correct just because they made the claim."

"A girl would frequent the gym almost every day I was there. I had just lost a lot of weight and was really working my ass off every day to lose more, sweating like crazy, etc. She would come in and get on the elliptical for about 20 minutes and get off without ever breaking a sweat, no resistance at all.  I made fun of her to my friend who helped me get motivated to lose a lot of weight and he said ""at least she is there"". It was so simple for me to judge that girl for not getting anything done, but she was been than the hundreds of other people who never have the motivation to even go to the gym at all. Changed the way I look at people doing workouts in the gym. If you are there but not working too hard or making much progress, at least you are there and are showing some motivation for wanting to change, all you have to do is get over the next hurdle: ""getting out of your comfort zone""."
"To preface, I grew up in rural Arkansas. Growing up I was ""taught"" that homosexuality was unnatural, so being gay was always something to be made fun of. You get the idea.   Then one day I was visiting some family and one of my older family members, whom I had always thought to be a pretty decent guy, said he thought gays should be jailed or executed.   That made me feel really dirty and sick. Why would anyone wish that on another person? For that matter what did they do that warranted such malicious intent? After that I started to reconsider how I behaved towards other people, especially those who were different from me.   In the end what he said made me reconsider my religious views, my attitude towards other people, and what reasons I had for developing hatred towards things that had no influence in my life."

"Except people often have different minds and don't respond the same way no matter how you slice it. People have incredibly different responses to pain and there is a lot of variation to both how one feels pain and how their mind reacts to it. Morphine makes a person just not care about pain and there are people whose minds are basically wired similarly. It sure as hell will be easier for them to not suffer. While other people are wired to be catastrophisers. You can fight it, *but only to a point*. Maybe not even that. How good are people at fighting epilepsy?  There are lots of examples where pain isn't transient so that's not very helpful. Chronic pain is not transient and a pretty big chunk of the population suffers from it. Depression is not very transient, either.  Your SO dumping you isn't exactly the worst thing that could happen to a person. If a person is in a good, supportive environment, that may not even affect them that much. It's usually an accumulation of events.  Suffering isn't ""optional"" and never was, it's a construct provided by evolution wired to promote people to seek better options. If it was so easy to get rid of it wouldn't exist because it wouldn't cause people to seek change. And that is the good side of it - those who are always content no matter the situation will have no need to change their situation. It does generate a lot of unnecessary suffering (what you're calling ""optional"") but there are significant limits to how much a person can control such things or their mind in the first place. Lots of studies actually point to things like social connections (which not everybody has) for reducing suffering. It's a good idea to try but it's very callous at best to call suffering ""optional"" when it's the reality of many of the human race."

All the while, I monitored my body noticing every issue which in turned amplified it. I was so scared of losing control. Well, I eventually found a good therapist to talk with and push me, where I needed to be pushed. There were a few things he said to me that clicked.

"I find that these types of mistakes are not only a hallmark of a native English speaker, but also of someone who doesn't read much published literature (fiction and non-fiction books, peer-reviewed periodic journals, among other things with good editors).  Journalists and bloggers propagate these mistakes because they often are not very well read themselves. When it's about quick communication, their messages tend to be more important than grammar and mechanics.  Also the widespread use of devices with autocorrect makes some errors hard to combat, especially its/it's. It took quite a long while of me correcting my iPad (it was a gift) before it even recognized its as a word. And even then, my iPad autocorrected that just now. I had to backspace over it. I even tried to put the word in my dictionary, and I tried to give it a shortcut (like how omw is by default On my way! in my dictionary) but shortcuts can't be less than three letters long."

"This is more specific to me I guess than the general things people have posted here. I saw a commercial a few years ago around 2006 when I was going to school and it was the most powerful commercial I'd seen. It made me feel good about being alive in a humbling way. That commercial was a commercial for DOW chemical. A few weeks went by and I saw a documentary called ""The Yes Men"" where these two guys pose a corporate officers for large corporations in an attempt to bring more attention to vital issues that these corporations disregard while doing business. They talked about DOW chemical and how it was a bad company and responsible for the worst chemical disasters in the history of the world that took place in India, thousands of people died and no compensation was paid to them; essentially the disaster was swept under the rug. So at that moment when I learned this I thought, 'If this company can make me feel good about them in a 30 second commercial even though I don't know anything about their past...I want to learn how to do this'. I quit my physical therapy track in school and decided to do film and haven't looked back."

"There's been a lot of research on this and it turns out it is sport-specific. Some sports require a particular physical ability that is highly genetic, and a person simply has to have the right genes to excel at that sport. But other sports (and many non-sport activities) can be approached in a variety of different ways, i.e. you look at the top 10 people and they all have a different genetic profile. A great example is running: top sprinters mostly have a certain characteristic genetic profile (""sprinters are born and not made""); endurance running has a bit more leeway and still requires certain genes, but there is a spread of several possible genetic profiles that can all work, and also with endurance running there is also a feature of a continued, incremental effect of training that continues for years and years. That is - continued training and persistence pay off more for endurance runners than for sprinters. Middle-distance runners are the most interesting - the top mid-distance runners are all over the map genetically, and there are a variety of different running strategies that can all be used to win. T  I'd guess that table tennis requires a lot of power burst movements (somewhat analogous to sprinting) along with wicked fast reaction time? Maybe it's more like sprinting than like mid-distance.  Me, I teach percussion and after years and years of teaching beginners, I came to the conclusion that 95% of novices can become ""very good"" drummers who can function at a professional level, but if and only if they put the practice time in and have good intuition about how to use practice time effectively. Then, within that 95% there are some kids who seem ""ridiculously talented"" yet whenever I quizzed them about their childhood it turned out they'd been doing some other sort of rhythmic thing for ages (horseback riding in one case, swing dance in another), something that gave them kind of a neural head-start on rhythm. There's also differneces in rate of improvement: within the 95% there are people who will learn more quickly or more slowly, but even the slow ones can attain a pretty high level of competence and in some cases they improve for years and years. I saw a couple cases of kids who seemed pretty ordinary initially, who eventually made it to pro level. Best in the world, maybe not; good enough to make beautiful music and play as a pro in a great band, definitely.    However there's also a 5% of people who simply have no sense of rhythm no matter how hard they try. I came to believe they have a perceptual issue in perceiving when things are happening simultaneously vs not simultaneously, and also a ""match self to others"" / ""mirroring"" issue in being unable to synchronize themselves with the rest of the band. (I feel like it is neural??) Some of these 5% are a lost cause. But they're relatively rare."

"Discipline without motivation is self-denial.  Growing up, I thought self-denial for the benefit of others was a good thing, but now I don't think it is anymore.  Allowing yourself to do things because you are supposed to makes you a puppet to whoever decides what it is you are supposed to do.  I think the question ""what do you want?"" is very important to ask.  Often we do things because we want some end result, but we do not realize that we are on the wrong track.  Staying on the wrong track out of discipline can sometimes pay off, but it can also do a lot of harm."

"""It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both."" - Niccolo Machiavelli  That and many other quotes in The Prince had a profound effect on me.

Funnily enough, I also think that it has made me a ""better"" person. I see now that it is in human nature to be violent, deceitful and self serving. There is nothing to be ashamed of. My relationships with others has dramatically improved, I am no longer naive and am able to quickly sift through all the bullshit people say and do and invest my time in people and passions that I truly care about.

That's not to say that if you're depressed or anxious or whatever that you shouldn't tell someone--but becoming a miserable little ball of self-pity never helped anyone overcome anything.

"The way people drive tells me a lot about who they are and how they go through life(in my mind). It may not be the case on an every person level, but I think it's a large reflection of the world as a whole today. Everybody is trying to navigate the roadways of life, and some people just have no consideration for anybody around them. They will stop and sit there in the way of other people. They will cut you off. They'll slow down the progress of an entire lane of traffic by not simply using a blinker(fucking the only communication they have). They just stare down fixating on this one small, largely insignificant thing, completely unaware of how their actions could interact/effect other people. Etc.   I get absolutely livid at other drivers, and it has nothing to do with it being about me getting from point A to point B in an efficient manner. It has everything to do with how people expect everyone else to drive around them and avoid their own stupidity because moving a finger 2 inches is too much work, or they don't have the patience to wait their turn like every single other person on the road. The list goes on. I fucking hate having to constantly stop driving and having to babysit other people from wrecking my shit."

"My girlfriend is Italian and she gets shit on constantly in the UK for not speaking perfect English. The rate her English is progressing is astonishing but if she makes mistakes or gets flustered people can be unrelentingly harsh. At first I thought she was being a bit over sensitive, but the longer I've been with her, the most I've heard it, especially if it's not obvious I'm with her in the moment. Any normal minor disagreement and the Brit will resort back to language as a way to win/feel superior. Like speaking really slowly as if she's dumb.  The worst part is she speaks 4 other languages absolutely fluently (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French)."

"I was doing some yard work with an older white guy.  The kind of guy that you would expect to have a country club membership.  He was a friend of my dad needed some help doing some house maintenance so he hired me, a young black male.  I was doing some hoeing when he said, ""Put your back into it boy!"" Young black male, ""boy"", doing field work for an old white gentleman.  It's pretty hard to not take that as a racist statement when you live in a white, republican community.  It was after I started driving home that I remembered that this guy was like a little kid in an adult's body and he really looked up to and sought advice from my dad, a black man ten years younger than him.  He was just trying to be playful but didn't realize the implications of what he said."

"That's actually really interesting. I can usually get a basic grasp of a language after spending two weeks in a country, and while German, Polish, French etc. were all okay - Spanish was by far the quickest language I got the hang of.

"Gladwell is skeptical about this (of course, others, including me, are skeptical of him), in David and Goliath he talks about how it's actually useful to be in a situation where you're the top of your class relative to others due to psychological effects:  ""The phenomenon of relative deprivation applied to education is called appropriately enough the ""Big Fish Little Pond Effect."" The more elite an educational institution is, the worse students feel about their own academic abilities. Students who would be at the top of their class at a good school can easily fall to the bottom of a really good school. Students who would feel that they have mastered a subject at a good school can have the feeling that they are falling farther and farther behind in a really good school. And that feeling as subjective and ridiculous and irrational as it may be matters. How you feel about your abilities your academic ""self-concept"" in the context of your classroom shapes your willingness to tackle challenges and finish difficult tasks. It's a crucial element in your motivation and confidence.""  Quote from here, got garbled unfortunately: https://www.ash.nl/ftpimages/401/download/download_1009994.pdf"

"In regards to a breakup, ""There's nothing about it that doesn't suck."" -My Father"
"Think that if you want, but (A) we weren't 'fighting for freedom for 700 years'. We were too poor to fight, so we were resentful apart from a few minor quickly destroyed rebellions/uprisings, (B) WW1 had little if any bearing on Ireland but for the men who volunteered for war. The LoN had a slightly bigger problem rather than worrying about another uprising in another colony of Britain.   The idea to join the Allies was mooted but the political fallout of joining with Britain was untenable so the next best thing was to stay 'neutral' but unoffically on the allied side. The IRA tried a failed plan to get the Nazis to assist them but displayed zero competence, as well as exaggerating their support and capabilities in the hope the Nazis might take them seriously, and the plan fell apart.  The adage of ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" was never proven to be more misguided than in that case. Aligning yourself to the Nazis to gain 'freedom' from your old colonists (who would be gone anyway if Germany had won) screams nonsense."
Less true the older you get.
"This happened a few years ago. I have a deep interest in political philosophy (much better than simply *politics*) and had read bits of everyone from Locke, to Marx, Aristotle, even Ayn Rand etc. I'd been used to discussing politics from a theoretical, classical perspective. E.g. ""Machiavelli's *the Prince* isn't really his most authentic work. His other writings are actually more idealistic and pro republic...""  An anthropologist educator I knew had gotten on this subject. He looked at certain positive outcomes in a society (income distribution, longevity, mental health statistics, low crime rates, economic stability) and checked for correlation for specific political systems.  In his opinion European social democracies seemed to be the best type of government.  What he said that changed my thinking (and it was a completely off the cuff comment too) was that any political system can be *logically consistent.* It's only when we look at *apparent results* do we see if the system actually *works.*  I've never been politically dogmatic, but it definitely changed the way I approach political questions now. Breaking up the banks might not be perfect idealists sync with a particular ideal in modernist political philosophy, but that doesn't mean it isn't the right thing to do."

Reminds me of the dialogue from TheCouncillor.
"I think a lot of people use that line of reasoning as an excuses not to try, or to underwrite the amount of control they and their circumstances have over what they are capable of.  But I think the premise of that line of reasoning is off too. There's huge difference between wanting to do something and only wanting to do something because you want to succeed. Having ambitions is probably inevitable but you're not your future self."
"Yeah, I wouldn't say he easily could be that size and healthy, but it's  definitely possible. I mean, that's an NFL sized guy for real."

"I've had some philosophical, theological and spiritual experiences in the past, but it became sort of a rare thing later in my life that my friends/people/humans would surprise me with their ideas of life/everything/whatever… Until a friend of mine (total genius) was talking about that everything is resonance in the vast space of the universe… And the ONLY THING SEPERATING OUR INNER EXISTANCE is a small, thin retina/film in the eyeball..

"""If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?"" - John Wooden"
"When I was in elementary school our classroom was visited by the vice principal at the exact same time I and a group of kids were messing with the class printer, which resulted in jamming it.  The only reason I still remember this distinctly is because of the response he gave when he started questioning me.  I said ""But I didn't do anything!"" and he replied ""That's right.  You didn't do *anything*."""

"This has happened to me more recently. I've moved to Sweden from the US and have tried my best to immerse myself in the language. I finally got a job and learned another American works there, she said my Swedish sounds great, and asked if I thought my accent was good, before I could even respond, a coworker (whom I hadn't met yet) chimed in and said ""no, it's actually really bad.""  I didn't take it to heart (and the asshole was recently fired for generally being a dick to everyone, including customers) but if he had said that so someone more self-conscious they probably would have given up on speaking the language entirely."

"As someone who hates being around people when I'm going through stuff, there's also the added ""leave me alone already"" factor. Sometimes I've just had enough of explaining why something sucks, and it's incredibly likely you're not going to say anything that I haven't heard a thousand times. That's why I'm a private person. Not because I don't want people to know - I just don't want people to talk at me about how to fix all my problems. There's only so many times I want to hear ""oh that sounds awful"" or ""keep your chin up"" or ""you know, everything happens for a reason."""

"As someone who has never had this problem (I've always been the opposite), it's hard to exactly say.  However, one reccomendation that I know has worked for some people in the past is gradual diet expansion. Basically, you will have to force feed yourself in times where you feel full. Don't go overboard; just a little bit at a time to very slowly expand your stomach. IIRC competitive eaters use this method to make their stomach bigger but don't hold me to that.  Over time, you'll find that not only can you eat more, but you've conditioned yourself to want more food.  If you're sure you want this to happen, then go ahead. From my experience, from anecdotal evidence, and from what studies I've read, it is much easier to expand your appetite than it is to shrink it.  The other method (that you can use alongside the aforementioned one) is simply eating more calorically dense foods. Eat more fats like butters and oils. Cheeses are good as well. Try to avoid too much dairy as it fills your stomach. This, of course, isn't the healthiest method to weight gain, but if you're simply trying to pack on quick pounds, it'll get you there.  Even at the highest levels of bodybuilding and weight lifting, eating enough can be a struggle. For some it stops being enjoyable after a certain point, but the idea is that it is important and desirable considering the goals one has set in mind.  Hopefully some of this helped. I know plenty of people who had trouble eating enough and I totally get that it isn't easy for a lot of people."

"“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”   ― Ira Glass"

"I don't know if someone has already answered you because it's been a while since I refreshed my page, but *could/would/should of* is a hallmark of a native speaker because it is a spelling mistake, not a phonetic mistake. The pronunciation is very similar, if not the same as the grammatically correct phrases *could/would/should have*, when they are contracted. *Could've* is nearly identical in sound as *could of*.  I've said before that these mistakes are a reading problem. People who learn languages by ear often make phonetic mistakes in spelling when they are not exposed to the written word, and as we all know, children learn to speak long before they learn how to read. These grammatical mistakes can be systemically corrected by exposure to books (the correct way of writing) instead of the tedious and difficult memorization experience in elementary school.  People who pick up English as a second language often pay more attention to grammar because that's how new languages make sense when learning languages after the Broca's area of the brain (language center) settles, which is in childhood.  I've heard various times of when that occurs. Generally age ten or so, maybe early teens. Though I've heard also that if a child is not exposed to certain sounds before age five, they have lots of trouble picking them up later. Hence you get the Japanese Engrish L/R problem. I had some European friends who could not pronounce the soft -th sound, and I've also heard some linguists describe our normal hard T as actually -th.

"So true- I used to work in a small apple certified store- long before corporate Apple Stores existed. If you had a mac, you were visiting someone like us. Because it fit my schedule I'd be the only guy in the service department every saturday. The number of people that came in an altered state because of w/e problem they were having was crazy, very few were actually mad, but there were a lot that were visibly upset, some cried, etc.  I still recall the panicked guy with the Powerbook 180c (top of the line then) who was doing a presentation later that day. Wouldn't boot, he was afraid the HD was gone along with all his backed up work. I was able to pull his drive within a couple minutes and reassure him it was all there, and then got super lucky we had a replacement MB for that model in the back. Got him in and out in less than 45m and (obviously) still remember how a big a deal it was for that guy. Went from world shattered to happy customer in less than an hour."

You're right.  It's just I never finished a degree.  I kind of just went to community college and dicked off for a couple years wasting time.  I was a little depressed back then and didn't think too far ahead so I ended up being kicked out of school for failing to many classes.  I developed some anxiety about going back because I'm afraid it'll happen again.  Whenever I get close to signing up for classes I'll have nightmares about having to withdraw from classes and wasting a bunch of money.  But I think I've finally decided it's at least worth a shot to go back and try again.

There most likely will be someone who works harder than you. But there are very few that will be smarter than you and work harder than you. That's where you can set yourself apart.""  (After he asked me to do some additional side task and I said I was busy): ""we're all busy. Everyone here has more work to do than they have time for.

The decisions you make on how to spend your time and what is most worth your time will determine if you ultimately succeed or fail in what you hope to achieve. You decide if you think this is worth your time."" (It was. The project helped me learn and develop in a whole new area.)

Why are you taking lessons when you don't even listen to music?  So finally I asked one of the kids why he wanted to learn the guitar.   ""Because I like the sound of it""  I guess when you play long enough you forget what draws you to an instrument in the first place. I can't really say it helped teaching, it's very hard to give content to kids who aren't driven by a desire to be good or emulate a hero, but it really helped me get in the mind of the students."

I think you learned your lesson, so allow me to use your comment to give a little advice to other travelers: even if many (and in some countries most) people speak good English, it's better to never assume that they are comfortable with the language and just ask. Something simple such as ""sorry, may I ask a question in English?"" will make most people willing to stop and listen. Locals can be rude, but a lot of tourists come off as aggressive and demanding sometimes, so acknowledging that people are not supposed to speak your language helps putting everyone at ease (this goes both ways) and tells you what level of English you should use!

The second law states that ""Heroes can not be produced by or from villains.""  The third law states that ""All heroes have long since been driven to extinction by the heroic actions of villains who believed the heroes to be the ultimate villains.""  Everyone is the villain of someone else's story."

I was talking to a guy I had just met, and after a few drinks, this came up (because he's lived a pretty amazing, adventure-filled life) and he said something that helped me totally reframe my thought process. He said that he thought if I truly was so anxious and naturally apprehensive, but still went out and chased after the things I wanted, that I was actually pretty brave. Even though I was scared, I didn't let it stop me from doing what I needed to do and living my life. I can't say that I'm any less nervous now, but I remember what he said and it really does help motivate me when I'm feeling down on myself."

"""The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in the particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ‘So it goes.’"" - Kurt Vonnegut"
"Two way tie for me.  1. I was 17 and sitting in the break room of a large retail giant where I worked bitching to anyone who would listen about how stupid the job was.  Some random old man was in there - never saw him before or again.  He could've been a customer who wandered in or possibly a relative of an employee.  He walked over, looked me square in the eye, and said, ""Be where you are.""  That was 29 years ago.  2.  My grandfather was just sitting there one day and out of nowhere said, ""In the end, life is nothing more than a collection of memories so make as many as you can, while you can.""  Both have had a profound impact on my life."
"Not to discourage you, but american medical training is an expensive shit show of jumping through hoop after hoop that I'm not sure a 37 year old would want to embark on. 2 to 3 years of flawless grades on undergrad pre req classes with high entrance exam scores and clinical experience, 2 more years of the most time intensive soul sucking academic curriculum you could imagine, top that off with taking a monster of a test that determines the rest of your life based on your score. Then throw on 2 more years of wandering around hospital after hospital for 70 hours a week at the bottom of the totem pole while never quite getting comfortable because the rotating never stops, and the testing never stops, and at this point the grades become more of a popularity contest of who can get closest to the residents, by the way these are the grades that residency programs like to look at to judge you... All while going into hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and you still have to go through residency where now if you make a mistake you're fucked and you're now making as much as a waiter. This goes on for 3 to 7 more years depending on the field and then you're ready to start your job.   Best case scenario, If you started now, you would  finish a non competitve residency like family medicine at age 47 with about 200,000 to 300,000 dollars of debt to pay off, and not be making much money. Oh well you want to do something competitive like integrated plastics? Ok good luck doing research on top of your schedule, away rotations, board scores in the top five percent of the nation, and working 80 hours a week for the rest of what's left of your life... That is if you are one of the VERY FEW lucky people a year to get into a program like that, other ultra competitive residencies have similar odds, just using that as an example  Take it from me, it's not that glamorous and if I could go back I'd probably be an engineer or something. If for some really weird reason you like the healthcare environment and can't live without it, do PA, NP, RN, anything else really.  You could be 47 and totally broke, in debt, and    tired for the rest of your life, or you could do LITERALLY anything else. People always have fleeting desires of becoming things like doctors or actors or fireman, but I will tell you not many people are in the right situation to go through all the bull shit of medical training. A lot of people think it takes talent or brilliance to be successful in something like medicine, but there's nothing special about it, it's just a long ass grind like any other shitty job out there. For some reason it gets glorified on tv and naive high school kids think they can just get good grades for a while and then start making 400 grand a year doing clinic 8 to 5 five days a week. It's not like that. I'm not saying you can't do medicine, I'm just saying you would probably be better off pursuing something without so much bullshit involved"

Friend: Its okay, everything is going to be okay.   Me: *having severe panic attack over the whole dumb thing* Okay?! OKAY?! No, it isn't! Tell me why this is all okay!  Friend: *pauses, looks straight at me* Do your socks match?  Me: The fuck are you on about now...  Friend: Do. Your. Socks. Match.  Me: No, they never do.  Friend: Then it can't be that be. Far as I see, if your socks aren't matching and the sun continues to rise, everything is going to be OK.

"I went to a community college (if you want to knock on community college see below) with tuition less than $5000. This is covered by Pell grants. Then me, my wife, and our infant daughter moved into my parents house so I could go to school, but only 3/4 time not a full time student. Then I got a part time job that was actually very lucky. I could still make $500 a week for my family for only 16hrs a week of work. So we moved out again and I went back full time.  Basically, I worked really hard, made sacrifices and chose a very affordable option. The community college was very important in all this. Those first two years of school are the same everywhere, except the top tier like Harvard or MIT. So just go wherever is cheapest. I lucked out a bit in that this particular CC has an excellent Computer Science program, so I found work before going on to a 4 year."

When moving boxes, make one trip with them on a pallet, instead of 100 trips  Communicate effectively. This keeps you from repeating yourself and from fixing ""completed"" tasks.  Keep tools organized, so you never spend time looking for them."

That's not grammar. Pronunciation in English is annoying. But that's not grammar.  English is incredibly easy to learn compared to most modern languages.

If you ever have questions do not hesitate to ask, we are more than happy when someone tries to learn our language"
"After high school, I was apprenticing to be a chef. Before I even learned how to cook anything, my mentor taught me two things:  1) Set yourself up for success  He said this in regards to mise en place, which is the preparation that you do before actual dinner service, but also how you set up your station. Say you're peeling a box of potatoes, you'd want things placed in a way that makes the work flow smoothly, like having the potatoes on the left hand side, a bucket or something for the peels in the middle, and a container for the peeled potatoes to the right, so you're constantly going from left to right without reaching for anything. Make work easier for yourself, not harder. The phrase applies not only to tasks at hand but also in a more general sense. If you want to succeed, you have to set yourself up to succeed.  2) Good enough is not good enough  Pretty self-explanatory. As soon as you think something is good enough, you become complacent and you stop improving. See [the bar scene from Whiplash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6vTI5g198E)"

"This is how languages evolve! Lots of things that weren't correct even a few decades ago in terms of grammar rules are now considered just fine.  People often used *who* for *whom* (but rarely ever *whom* for *who*) so much that now both are considered objects, but while *who* may still be a subject, *whom* is only ever an object.  Split infinitives used to merit docked letter grades in university. An infinitive is the base form of a verb, usually denoted in English by the addition of the word *to*. *Dormir* is *to sleep* in Spanish; see how the Spanish infinitive is one word? The English infinitive should be treated as one word as well.  This means that *to sleep soundly* is correct, while *to soundly sleep* is not.  Unfortunately that means the iconic Star Trek phrase, ""To boldly go where no man has gone before"" is incorrect and should be, ""To go boldly...""  Right now, punctuation concerning quotes is in contention. I have no idea anymore if I should punctuate sentences outside of quotation marks when I'm quoting something that has no punctuation, like if I'm quoting just a phrase. I'm not sure my ellipsis needs a period after it, and for a long time British mechanics stipulated that punctuation goes after the quotation marks if the actual quotation didn't include it, but American mechanics always included it within."

"Well I briefly tried to learn guitar and realized how hard it is, so I'm not one to gauge how easy songs are and aren't. My friend who is very good at guitar tried to teach me some things, and I'll give it to him that he was very patient with me and tried his best to keep me motivated, but I think he also kind of forgot what it's like to be a *true* beginner. Some people start and rhythem comes naturally to them, others have fingers long and pointy enough to not mute any strings, and some people (like me) need to start at the very very bottom.  I was 21/22 when I tried to learn guitar, and of course I wish I started younger and stayed disciplined with it, but it's not like I was too old to learn. You're never too old to learn. I love music and I wish I could play, but honestly, I'm content with not knowing how. What I did learn is how hard it is to learn to play an instrument, I learned what bends, slides, and chords *sound* like, I realized that sometimes, the stuff that's easy and slow to play can sound just as beautiful as something fast and difficult, and all of that alone has made me appreciate music that much more."

"I was a scrawny teen who decided to take up weight lifting to try and put on some muscle. After about 6 months, I saw very little results and was very discouraged. I decided it wasn't worth the effort and to give up.   Then my Dad told me ""Nothing's going to change unless you make a change, stick with it"".  That stuck with me, and I've been going to the gym 3-4 times a week for the past 4 years. This is particularly helpful for working out or losing weight. I know how hard exercising can be, and when you don't see results it may just seem like it's not worth it, but you're body won't magically get in shape by itself. Stick with your workouts, I promise, over time it will pay off."

And later on still there’ll grow trees from him, with new squirrels skipping about in them. Do you think that’s so very sad?"" I used that to explain death to my child when trying to tell her about her dead grandma. It really helped her make peace with the idea of death.  Sorry for your loss but your grandma is growing new trees right now, passing on her life to bring new life to the world, so she's never really gone."

I decided to take a job at the theme park at minimum wage ($6/hour?).   My job was to clean up the theater after the drunk people mess it up. Every night after everybody leaves, we need to straighten the charis. These chairs were simply tie together with freaken strapes. There were about 20 to 30 chairs tied together in a row.   The supervisor was being anal and tries to make everything perfect. Our team spent at least 30 extra minutes straighten chairs cuz they were a couple CM apart.   I went home and complaint to my brother about this mundane task we had to do.   He replied with ""if you don't go to school, you will be doing this your whole life""  After that phase, I went back to high-school and study. I graduated university and got a job at the bank.

"I've taken engineering classes that involved group projects as part of my degree.  The people who were better students (I can't know anyone's GPA, obviously) generally had better communication skills, probably because they were better students in other classes like English as well.  I mean I definitely understand where the stereotype comes from, because people like that definitely exist.  One of my professors talked about one of his former students who was brilliant, but to work with him you basically had to slide problems under the door for him to calculate and slide back.  He got three very good job offers, but other students at the time were getting six to seven (perhaps not as good) job offers on average.  And I've personally known good students who were insufferable too-smart-for-the-room types, but I've known many more who were down-to-earth and pleasant to work with.  To say that *most* people, even engineering students, with 3.5+ GPAs lack people skills is simply ridiculous."

This is the one.    You hear so much about talent and interest.  Well the reality is this; those supposed really just talented are the ones in a million.  Most people think they like something and then find  once they get past the intro easy lesson that they suck at it.   The reason they suck is that they are new at it.   So many lose interest thinking they are just not talented because they have fallen for the bullshit that if you can't just do it you shouldn't.   The others  are  not fooled  and decide if I want to be good at this I must first be willing to work hard and get past the stage of sucking at it.

"I went on a French exchange last year, I have a horrible french accent and a lot of people pointed it out. Eventually I got tired of it so when people did it I would start speaking English really fast saying something like ""oh you speak English too? That's great because it's so much faster and easy to communicate if I speak in English..."" and I would just start rambling on and on until I could tell they got annoyed. Then I'd give them a shit eating grin and walk away"

And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine.   And into my garden stole,  When the night had veild the pole;  In the morning glad I see;  My foe outstretched beneath the tree."

"When I was 17 or so, I had this really good friend, Tristan, who was 28 or so.  We would talk politics all the time, and he'd always roll his eyes at me.  I was a ""socialist"" and supported the Democrats, he was an anarchist and supported nobody.  One day we decided to go see Highlander 3 and walk to the theater, which was about six miles away.  As we're walking, I started complaining about Republicans, and he got annoyed with me -- but this time, instead of arguing with me, he just said ""You know, you're completely full of shit.""  And I got offended and we started arguing.  It was a long walk and he talked a lot about the principles I believed in -- freedom of choice, individuality, non-violence, etc. -- and kept focusing on all the ways the Democrats and socialists betrayed those principles.  And I kept arguing that anarchism just plain wouldn't work.  And finally he said something that has stuck with me for 23 years.  He said ""If you only believe in a principle when the other guy violates it, and you don't care when your side violates it, then you don't really believe in the principle.  You're just full of shit.""  It definitely changed my way of thinking -- I became much more critical of my ""fellow liberals"" and over time, I came to realize that ""my side"" was just as bad as ""the other side,"" and that picking sides was a fool's errand.  I still don't believe anarchism is really possible, but I also believe that anarchists are the only people who are ""right."""

And that my existence is just another version of someone else's existence and everything has an equal right to that existence. Not just people, but all things.  There's a sacredness in that feeling.    Yes, it's spiritual and comforting. But it's also educational, if you're open to believing that. It changed the way I think about everything in the world, and how I treat/feel treated by other living things.   It's also made me question how I feel about the destructive nature of humans. Is it all part of ""The Point""? As an environmental activist, this idea is something that I struggle with.   Edit: formatting"

"I was your expectable post-high-school nerd, but of a loner, not a lot of friends, and a bit of a pessimistic view of the world.  In college, my walk to class always took me past the house of an old Indian man, who was usually tending to his lawn or garden when I passed by.  He'd usually say hi, so I'd say hi.  One day, he asked how my day was, I answered ""it's alright, I guess.  How 'bout you?""  ""I am still alive, so today is a good day."" ----------------------------------------------  It was a mindblowing statement, and it sort of brought my whole worldview to a total halt.  All at once, a lot of the stuff I was just sort of ambiently annoyed with became totally trivial.  Left all that sad bullshit behind, and I've been a much happier person ever since.  The saddest part was that I never saw him again.  Dunno if our schedules just never lined up, or if he moved, or if he died.  It's been a decade, and I never forgot that conversation."

"After my friend died last September, I was feeling pretty down. All I did was spend my time thinking about the futility of life; that we will all inevitably die.  I attended my friend's funeral that afternoon and went to work later that day and I sat down outside of my workplace, looking around and thinking, ""Everybody here is one day going to die. That child walking with their mother is going to lose their parent... or maybe the parent will lose that child. They're going to die. I'm going to die. Eventually."" This is the kind of thing that the funeral got me thinking upon seeing the faces of all the destroyed loved ones.  While sitting, a new coworker of mine waddled on by--a fairly subtle and quiet guy (straight forward)--and decided to stand by me. ""What's wrong?"" he asked. ""My friend died last week. Today was his funeral."" There wasn't much else to say.  ""Huh,"" my coworker replied. ""Well you seemed pretty sad so I figured it had to be something pretty major considering how happy you've usually been since I started.""  There was a short silence.  ""I'm not usually like this but I've never lost a friend so...""  There was another short silence followed by what was, and still is, without a doubt, the best thing anybody could have said, though who better to say it than somebody who doesn't know me at all? Now I don't remember what he said word for word but here's the better part of it:  ""I'm sorry for the loss of your friend. I really am. But death's inevitable. If you spend every day thinking about death, you're just going to waste your life. I could stand at the corner of my street, waiting for the ice-cream truck because I know it's going to come. I can spend all of my time thinking about it and waiting but it'd only be a waste of time... or I can address it when it comes around and smell the roses in the meantime.""  Again, I don't remember much of what he said but he definitely mentioned the inevitability of death, the ice-cream truck, and the roses which is what struck me. I wasn't happy right away but I thought about his words from that moment onward and it's really what has helped get me through my grandmother's sickness at the moment."
"Of course potential/resources come into play as well, but it doesn't discount natural talent.  Black people thoroughly dominate some athletics, like running, despite on average coming from less resources than other people.  They have a slightly different body type that happens to make them slightly better at running.  There's an ideal body type with swimming too: longer torso and shorter legs.  Yes you need access to a swimming pool to train, but if you want to compete at a high level like the Olympics, you also need the right body type or you're out of luck."
Get busy living or get busy dying.
Context?
"Steve Jobs' quote about death stuck with me:  “Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.   Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.   No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”"

When I was faced with a problem that was being a pain in the ass I one day thought to myself, ""What would they do?"" then started googling for answers, checking, trying, searching.. eventually fixing the problem. It changed my entire outlook on life, and now instead of thinking things go wrong because they hate me, I think 'this could be a good learning experience, I'll give it a go.' and it makes the task of figuring out the problem that much funner and easier to handle.

You don't decide that you're someone another person should trust, just be available and if they trust you to open up, they will. He was making a bad situation worse by disguising self-absorbed friend collecting with being a good friend. People trust who they trust, not being in somebody's inner circle isn't necessarily a reflection of you so much as of them. You have no idea what made them get to a place of being so guarded so respect it and back off. Insisting on forcing your way in is just self-centered attention seeking."

"I had a coach in high school who rode my ass all the time. Play smarter, pick up that block, make better cuts, and it pissed me off. One day he saw me roll my eyes and hang my head and sprinted over to me, grabbed my facemask and got right in my face and said, ""the day I stop riding you is the day I stop giving a fuck, you DON'T want that"".

"&gt; The several wars that took place within ireland during and after WW1 also were a huge factor.  Come again? Several wars? Please list them. War of Independence and Civil War, OK. After that?  I haven't read the book, nor know anything about it, but as we were all taught with Folens books, I'll take a look. And I just found a synopsis of it online. No sign of a line on the reason for neutrality.  BTW, Folens was a Nazi also, FYI.  No impact on the books' accuracy, but it's interesting to note that a Nazi got free reign in Ireland after the war to set up a monopoly in school textbooks."

"&gt; The amount of ignorance is too damn high. India has no official language. There is technically no official language in India. But India does recognise a lot of languages. No state in India considers English as an official language. And most of all Indians who are taught English as a first language, probably speak better than most of the western counterparts.  You sure have a *lot* of editing to do on this wikipedia page, then!  [Languages with official status in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_with_official_status_in_India)  Based on what you say, pretty much the entire content of that article is fiction.  The laws and constitutional provisions it refers to don't exist.  The table of official languages probably does omit some recognized languages and could use updating perhaps, but based on your comment the entire existence of that table is fiction too.  &gt; And No. There is no such thing as Indian English. LOL. God. I really wish there was though. The English we indians speak is just a mixture of British and American English.   As is the whole chapter about Indian English in one of my books about the English language - apparently that's not real either."

"I feel like ""outrage culture"" is something that works in a bizarre way. For every one person who's actually offended by something bizarre or extreme, there are a hundred people claiming that they represent everyone who disagrees with them. It's a modified strawman argument, a way to set up a strawman, then point to a handful of real world examples as proof that you're actually addressing your opponent instead of a caricature.  The relative handful of people who got pissed off at Stephen Colbert for an intentionally inappropriate joke about Asians don't represent the millions of reasonable people (including Colbert) who think that naming a football team after a pejorative or stereotype for Native Americans is wrong. A few people who thought a Saami character in *Frozen* didn't look ""indigenous"" enough aren't everyone who wants to see more minorities represented in film. Dredging up examples like that makes an argument into a fight between extremes, and turns what should be serious debates about privilege and prejudice into political theater. If anything, it makes extreme opinions in opposition more common by encouraging everyone to run to opposite ends of a spectrum of ideas, because everything in between is treated as though it doesn't exist."

"Japanese mostly uses a subset of english phonemes, has very regular conjugation and tenses (doesn't even have a future tense! or at least that we used), and has particles to indicate word relationships. Ridiculously easy, in my 3 years of school. It's been 10 years and I still remember all the conjugations and tenses.  However, one major component of Japanese spoken fluency is the fact that in practice a lot of these components are dropped. In the same way that saying ""Crazy"" with a head nod is a whole sentence in spoken english, Japanese is often abbreviated, and that can be difficult.  The written language is entirely another beast. Fluency to read a newspaper requires knowing ~10k kanji, and if you want to pronounce people's names correctly toss in another 5k easily."

"My infant daughter didn't sleep more than two hours at a time for the first seven months. I was up and down off the bed constantly. It was killing me physically and mentally. I called my dad and cried to him and he said,  ""Honey, children will take and take everything you give. They will always want more.""   It made me realize that I could wait for her to stop needing me (in this case, helping her fall asleep) but had to find the way to gently but firmly create opportunities for her to be her own person. We immediately did the ""let cry"" sleep method and she was sleeping 6 hours in two tries.   She walked to school by herself in 2nd grade (school was in our neighborhood), can interact with sales people and servers like an adult, and is growing up to be her own person. When she gets too dependent, I recognize it is because of what my dad said. It's usually when I'm complaining about how clingy she's being!"

The mistake we make as a society is to think everything is the fault of the institution itself, and we forget that institutions are made of people.

My cousin told me, ""It takes more time and energy to complain about something while trying to do it than just doing it right off the bat."" Too me a year or two to really take it to heart.

"It wasn't a single sentence, but watching Planet Earth completely changed how I view the male/female dynamic in humans.  Put simply, in EVERY species it featured, the male was the ""good looking"" one.  It makes sense: men have to attract mates, not the other way around, because females are the ""gatekeepers"" of reproduction.  I'd always grown up thinking of women as the ""pretty ones,"" and girls are often pressured to find a husband, but that's really a quirk of our culture.    The ""natural"" state is for men to primp and preen and try to look beautiful so they can attract a female, not the other way around."

They do eat normal portion sizes. Same as they always have. 3 sandwiches isn't a lot. The plate would look empty with just two on there...  Some people have never experienced for themselves how other people consume day to day, and need someone to gift them that understanding and knowledge from their own life experiences to help the fatty not consume 4,000 calories a day thinking they really don't eat that much.

There was this one kid who was the latter, and just was really unnecessarily mean, rude, and unhelpful to the kids he deemed weren't good artists. It finally got to a point where during a critique where he was being rude, I said in a neutral tone ""Why are you always so rude?  all here to improve.""  He just stared at me, and the instructor redirected the conversation, but that kid actually started offering suggestions to help kids out, instead of just pointing out the mistakes and making fun of them."

At first there was that initial shock, the *holy shit that's a body* feeling, but I quickly realized that whatever made her human is gone now. What I was looking at is just the shell.   In 2009 my best friend died and I went to his service and stood in the back of the funeral home looking at this blue urn. He had been cremated. I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that my best friend in the world, my right hand, was in that urn. But he wasn't, not really. Again, it was just the shell in there. I still remember his laugh and smile. I remember all of the beautiful and complicated and wonderful things about him that made him who he was. I remember all of the times he was there for me when no one else was. Whatever made him human was gone and all that was in that urn was his physical body returning to dust. Started from stardust and ended in ashes.   After he died I had a really hard time with life obviously, my best friend was gone. But the whole experience made me a different person and made me learn that hard lesson of loving the people you love while they're here.   So, give your friends a hug when you can.

(Steroids thin tissues, which may have led to the rupture) A couple days later in lab class I felt this pop in my belly followed by this feeling of my insides unraveling. Later that evening I was in terrible pain. I was on the toilet while throwing up in the bathtub at the same time. I got it in my head to try and sleep it off. I took some sleeping pills. My brother came home and found me moaning on the couch unable to move. He called 911 and saved my life. By the time I got to the hospital I was screaming my head off in the worst pain of my life.

Think of how Chinese people dislike Japanese, think of how Catalan people dislike some spanish people, think of how Jewish people dislike German people, think or how some Ukrainian dislike Russian people, and so on.   The French speakers in Québec were killed, tortured, impeached, had their culture and language spat on (up until today) by an English majority. Now, other places in the world never had such a history with English speakers, nor does China has any animosity towards Spain, nor do you have any towards Uruguay or some place like that. It's a very specific conflict, rooted in History, that obviously has nothing to do with *you*, but even for myself, living in Alberta, speaking perfect English and never asking any special treatment, I get some rude comments from people here when they learn I'm from Québec.   It very often goes the other way around, but when we point it out, it's way easier to just say we started it so the English speaker just reacted to our misbehavings than looking into your own ways and prejudices. Quebeckers, despite only being 8 millions, travel all over the world, there's no where I've travelled in the world where I haven't found a Quebecker (China, France, Thailand, England, Germany, Sweden, Norway, etc), we're one of the most open to the world people there is, but we do have something against imperialistic English speakers because of their *very* imperialistic behaviours and history."

It seems like some very ""Sunday school"" theology. I won't pretend to have the answers, but ""love me or burn in hell"" doesn't really fit with the God in the gospels who becomes vulnerable and says very little about hellfire and a lot more about being good to others and creation, generally not being a douchebag, abusing power, amassing wealth, being violent, etc."

"Of course as a Christian I didn't think that's how the Christian God behaved, but when I took a step back and took an objective look that IS how the Christian God behaves.  First we have to question whose plan/design it was that if we don't accept Christ we go to hell. Who's plan was this? Was it God's plan/design? Satan's plan/design? No one?  Now if it was God's plan/design he is vain and evil. Asking humanity to love him or burn in hell is similar to a madman holding a gun to a woman's head demanding that she love him or die.   If it was Satan's plan/design that means that Satan is more powerful than God and able to control how he behaves/functions.  If it was no ones design/plan and God can't override it then he is not all powerful and able to do all things as scripture says.  So either God is evil, weaker than Satan, or is not all powerful."

[Maybe you mean them.](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/11/04/361403249/what-makes-kenyas-marathon-runners-the-worlds-best)  Sports like running are sports that anyone can do regardless of circumstances which is why so many do it in spite of resources. You see the same pattern with Soccer. Anyone can play it since it doesn't require that much equipment.  I would also say that you're still equating potential and achievement with talent. A really short, weak kid who runs as fast as an average kid can still be considered talented at running, although he might not achieve much in the area."

It was triggered by how my dad treated me. So it makes sense that once I got away from him I would be happy again, right? After 2 years of the depression I lived with my mom full time, but I was still sad. There were no outside forces causing me to be sad. Everyone in my life loved me and supported me, I wasn't bullied or anything. *But I was still sad.* Why you may ask? I got into the habit of constantly tearing myself down, telling myself I was worthless and I had no meaning or reason to be alive. I was mean to myself to replace my dad being mean to me.   So, the first two years of my depression the pain was inevitable. The last two, the suffering could have been avoided.   That's my personal experience with that situation. Like I said I realize that people have many different ways of coping with pain, but situations like that do exist.    If you were wondering I am now fully recovered and happier than ever."

You either support giving people help or you don't. All your other beliefs may differ. It doesn't matter. That dominates the rest. You may care for supply and demand but ultimately you think giving help to people trumps it, so you're nowhere near as strong on that side. If you believed supply and demand was more important, you wouldn't agree with social services. These are hugely defining views, they just are.  You believe it enough that I can make predictions as to what other things you'll believe. That's the important part. People who pigeonhole are attempting to do the same but are using narrower or wider categories. That's a heuristic, there are always errors in heuristics, that doesn't mean they're wrong. Most people who support guns are also against abortion. I support guns but I am in favor of abortion, sucks to be me but what can you do. It doesn't mean that supporting guns or favoring abortion are suddenly not ideologies, it just means people are making assumption errors.  Just because someone is holding a different belief from you doesn't mean that they don't think it's the best solution to a problem. They may very well think their system works really well. Even if it doesn't.  &gt; Look at all the fucking 'liberals' on reddit, they circlejerk and feel superior amongst themselves in this, it's awful.  You seem to be beating a drum to make yourself look superior among everyone else, too, and from what I can see it's purely based on semantics. You've convinced yourself that you're simply superior because you refuse to call your beliefs an ideology.  Ideologies can be changed, lost, reacquired. It's a mechanism for reorganizing important things to reconsider. Without it, we wouldn't be able to do anything. Don't worry, though, there are already plenty of cancers in your thoughts by nature of being human. We're pretty bad at being rational for plenty of reasons, this is one of them but so are many others and having them is better than not.  &gt; And on ideology, people pigeon hole what they believe into a certain ideology so that they don't have to think for themselves.  No, that's [cached thoughts](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/) and maybe you should go read that article so you better understand this issue. It's not an issue of people having ideologies (which are thought systems: actually a good thing), it's an issue of people not constructing their own ideologies, and they usually don't do it because it's *hard*.

"I haven't noticed this. I'm pretty sure rationality and emotion run in parallel. Rationality is more of a tool to apply in the context of emotions rather than its own thing. I think you may be confusing with the phenomenon of highly intelligent sociopaths, but there are plenty of rational and empathetic people. Emotion and stupidity was always a bad combination and is actually what lead to a lot of ills in the past. I disagree that it suddenly became more valuable: it was always valuable, but we just didn't have it for a while because people unfortunately do not have enough capacity to be rational without prior influence and history and such.  I also still didn't hear a single argument as to how emotions and instincts were so valuable in the past. Emotions lead to both shame-promoting behaviors which allows minorities to oppress everyone else and also to things like violence. We need enough emotional level to care to survive and that's about it."

That's the moment they are ready to heal""   I recently lost my father and I just wanted to be alone for a week. This piece of wisdom never rang more true than when he passed. I know he was gone, but if anyone tried to bring it up I shut them down for fear of busting into tears, and I didn't want that to happen. I often visited my mum and we talked about random things, normal things, and when the time was right, when we really needed it, we talked about him. It feels so much better talking about death when you are ready to, not because someone forces you, and you feel so much better for it.   Be a good friend, if you wait for them, they will eventually talk about it."

And no moron represents my religion. No one does. No one and nothing except the book that God revealed and the messages that his Prophet was told to deliver through his actions and words. There's 1.7 billion Muslims in the world. Why do you decide to focus on less than 1% of the entire religion to conclude that it's a religion of violence? Wouldn't all the Muslims in the world be bent on world massacre if the Quran was offering reward for murder? Wouldn't everyday Muslims who go to college and the gym and the grocery store be looking for someone to kill? Come on, be logical, please.   I apologize that you feel that way but I genuinely don't feel it's fair to just wait around for Muslims to ""stop the violence"". My community in Arizona is constantly holding events about Islamic awareness and holding rallies about the same messages. I'm sure tons of other communities are, too. It sucks that nowadays I can't confidently tell people like you that if you want to learn about Islam, go meet a Muslim. Unfortunately that's not the case. People misinterpret the religion, don't study it enough, get persuaded by other lunatics to do things in the name of Islam, and many other things. The truth now is that if you're truly interested in learning about the religion, you should study the book and its context, and Muhammad's teachings. I'd love to say you can just ask any Muslim or just look at the news but the media hates us because something like 75,000 Muslims out of 1,700,000,000 are idiotic pigs who mass murder and it's very difficult to stand against violence that's being committed in the name of a religion that I don't even follow."

""Could have been avoided"" is not the same thing. Your first 2 years could also have been avoided if someone did something about your situation. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the stoic philosophy of: ""you can simply choose not to feel"".  I'm glad you recovered but I'm wondering what was involved.

"Way late to the party, but whatever.  I was 14 or so, just out of a rather short and not very good relationship, and chatting with my Dad about it as he was driving me home from something or other. Being fourteen and recently broken-up, naturally I was blaming everything about our relationship on her. Finally Dad looks at me and says, ""You know, the only common denominator in all of your past failed relationships is you.""  While it may sound like a criticism or an insult, I immediately recognized what he was saying. In any relationship I've had that didn't make it, *I* was a part of it. Some choice I made along the way led the relationship to it's end; even if it was simply choosing to be with someone that I was incompatible with.  Those few words forced me to acknowledge my responsibility in every relationship since. And to accept, and admit to those mistakes I might have made along the way.  Now, closing in on 7 years of marriage, I still think of those words, and quietly thank Dad for that advice."

I can´t tell you how many times I don´t feel like doing something that I know is good for me, but once I start doing it, it isn´t so bad, and most of the time is actually fun and satisfying.  I also noticed that I often don´t do things because I feel tired, and if I manage to start something regardless, the tiredness just vanishes. I realized I´m procrastinating so often not because I´m tired, but I´m often tired because I´m procrastinating.  I´ve been mixing up cause and effect for almost 10 years and finally am able to break out of this terrible rut."

"The Nazis hated the Swiss. What were they supposed to do during WW2 in order to fight evil? They were surrounded on all sides. They appeased the Nazi's for this reason. Being a landlocked country they rely on land trade for a huge amount of resources. They had the resources to defend their country against invasion (although Hitler could have taken Switzerland if he wanted, it would have been costly see: Operation Tannenbaum), but did they have the resources to join the Allies and fight the Germans without Goering bombing Zurich into eternity? The Swiss actually did shoot down several Luftwaffe aircraft during the invasion of France. While the Swiss worked with the Third Reich economically, they aided the Allies with various espionage projects, and politically they definitely sided with the Allies. While they were neutral in terms of not being in actual war with another nation, technically they did play against the Axis."

Sometimes that means letting them fail, other times that means letting small things go.  My other parenting philosophy is ""do not negotiate with terrorists.""

"In high school,  in 1991, my forever chipper friend told me her secret for always being happy. Fake it till you make it.   She said she has bad days too. She just puts on a smile and acts happy and it tricks your mind into being happy. Alternatively,  she would find someone who was also having a bad day and do something nice for them. The act of kindness would cheer the other person up, thus cheering my friend up.   I used that lesson for years.  For myself, for my psych patients (in the U.S. Navy hospital in Portsmouth Virginia), and it really did work for those who weren't stuck in a severe depression.   Fast forward, early 2007. She and I lost contact around 5 years prior. I found out she had terminal breast cancer. I was crushed. But she was still positive. She shared stories of the medical professionals who changed her life in her fight to live her life on her terms. They were nurses.   I started college to be a nurse that autumn. Because of Amy.

"I find a lot of people are really quite genuine when they listen and offer advice.  Having someone removed from the situation (as in a co-worker) allows them to be a little less bias to the situation.  It takes a special sort of someone to cut through the emotion and see the actions you are taking and calling you out on it when you are hurting, but someone removed can often see this much clearer.  This is why I like seeing a therapist every once in a while.  It's not a regular thing, but talking to someone removed from the situation helps me clear my own mind."

"There are a few things people said to me that changed my way of thinking. As a kid and a teen, I had tons of anxiety, all the time, about everything. It was not a therapist who helped me get over this, but a chronically happy boyfriend who said to me one day, ""You need to learn to say 'fuck it' when you are anxious about doing something and then just do it."" This simple, crude phrase 'fuck it' has given me the ability to do more in life than I ever dreamed. He also told me that if I couldn't stop worrying about something to think of the absolute worst case scenario that could happen and plan out how I would get through it. ""Once you know you'll be ok in the worst case scenario, there's no more need to worry."" This has gotten me through the darkest times of my life because I always know I can come out on the other side ok.  The other thing that profoundly changed the way I think came from my father, and he would lose all hope if he knew how this affected me. I come from a very religious family. We went to church Sunday morning, Sunday evening, and Wednesday night, and there were Bible study groups in between. One morning, when I was about 6, on the way to church, I asked, ""Why do we go to church?"" He said, ""Because God commands it."" This conversation went on for quite a while, with me peppering him with questions. Here is the short version: me ""What if there is no God?"" dad ""There is a God, and if we don't go to church, we won't go to heaven."" me ""What if there is no heaven?"" dad ""Then, we go to church so that we don't go to hell."" me ""What if there is no hell?"" dad, finally too frustrated to continue this conversation ""Well! Then, we go to church JUST IN CASE!!!"" me ""So, church is like insurance?"" We rode the rest of the way to church in silence.  I'm not sure how I knew what insurance was at that age, but I never thought of religion in the same way ever again."

I lived in a cage of my own design.   Sitting by myself with my friend who narrowly made it in time, I thought back to that class and what my teacher said.   Its not about learning from war, learning from the mistakes of Napoleon Bonaparte or George Bush.   Its about not repeating the mistakes of your predecessors and being better than where you came from. In my case, it was finally admitting my mental illness and getting help. It was not giving in to the overwhelming urge to end my temporary suffering with a permanent solution.    My last suicide attempt was 6 years ago and I have gone through many hours of therapy.

I began to think of myself in a larger scope from that day on and about how I think I matter to myself and how I really matter to humanity. And many of my reasons for suicidal tendencies actually died with that realisation. I often feel very alone in understanding the concept because so many people just cannot break themselves away from their own perspectives long enough to see it.   We don't matter, but we can.  I don't mean get successful and collect every meaningful experience you can before you die, because you could win a billion dollars tomorrow and still be completely unworthy of knowing about.  History in part is the legacy of humanity for which our lives should be lived. By that I mean that if your actions each day are not guided by anything other than your own whim to enjoy yourself and keep out of trouble, then you will always be a forgettable non contributing asshole.   The point is not to 'be remembered' in such vanity that was well portrayed by Bender from Futurama, but to add value to humanity by taking part of it's responsibility onto yourself. So very few are real contributors to humanity, and most that are have only been induced to action by personal gains (monetary greed, social greed, religious merit point greed), but at the end of the day they move us slowly forward so we appreciate them. We measure their effort as though it represents a maximum potential of ourselves, and then plan our minimal goals accordingly; a grossly lazy measure of ourselves.   Now whether that means you spend all your days in a lab trying to cure something, or all day outside building something or your entire life spinning thoughts around in your head so you can understand something, it doesn't matter as long as you are doing it for humanity.   Imagine if each person took the similar idea that they would improve one aspect of the world in their lives on their own by effort.   So the phrase 'I am unimportant' is true and actually something you are unknowingly applying to yourself when you do not act in accordance with humanities best interests. To fully realise 'We are important' for the objective truth we claim it is, is to realise it will only stand for as long as we can prove it is. And so many people give up or never try to prove it in their own lives."

"This isn't really someone per say, but a lot of people.   When I was a kid (8 or 9yrs old) my dad was into selling/doing drugs. He got busted and was sent to a rehab facility. After he got out of rehab, he would get us on the weekends where he would take us to AA/NA/CA meetings with him. My little bro and I would mostly munch on donuts and play with ninja turtles in the back of the room, but sometimes I would go sit with my dad and listen to people stories.   It was very humbling to hear how some of these people had lost their families and damn near almost died, because of their addictions. But, they had managed to get sober and stay sober, get their families back, and start their lives again.   My dad has been completely sober for 25 years now.   What also changed me, was that he would take us to volunteer places on the weekends. We would deliver meals for 'Meals on Wheels' on thanksgiving instead of making a huge dinner, help out at the local centers for abused families, help set up AA events.  To this day I'm a much more compassionate person and I volunteer, foster dogs, and donate whenever I can."

"Something simple my endocrinologist had told me--""Don't let Diabetes control you, you need to control your Diabetes""  It may be a simple concept but this helps me out everyday of my life. Diabetes is generally easy to control but if you are not diligent with every meal and any time that you don't feel quite right it can easily take you over. This kept me living my life as normally as possible, only difference being some callused finger tips from testing my blood sugar and becoming very familiar with syringes. Many people are surprised to find out that I have type one diabetes because of how healthy I look, might also have something to do with a general lack of knowledge of what the disease is but hell I know I didn't know what it was before I was diagnosed.   Just a tip, type one diabetics can eat WHATEVER they want, sugar does not kill us, we understand what we are doing and know that we will have to take more insulin for that huge ice cream sundae we want for desert. Don't ask a diabetic ""can you eat that?"", unless of course you are a really close friend, otherwise that shit is annoying as hell"

I still want the right to die on my own terms if/when the time comes, but I now want there to be very strong protections and safeguards to protect poor people and those without insurance and those whose families are jerks."

"I always felt like learning English was in fact learning two languages: the written one, and the spoken one. I speak French and I've learned the basics of a few languages and English's pronunciation is the hardest. With Spanish or German, you can hear a word you don't know, guess it's spelling, and look it up in a dictionary. With English, you hear a word, and you have no idea what vowel is in there (because half of them are pronounced ""uh"" anyway), then you have the tonic accents which sometimes make some of the syllables unintelligible, and finally you have those strange words like ""slough"", ""dough"", ""sew"" (pronounced ""sow"", wtf), ""strength"", ""bomb"" (still not sure if bomber is ""bom-bur"" or ""bom-mur"", I'm gonna have to look it up), etc.    French itself is weird with how its written, but it's nothing compared to English.

"Ok here's a thought: Maybe the use of terms like ""privilege"" is itself, well, kind of privileged. Maybe that's what annoys me. It implies that there's this club of academics who have studied the issue and the fact that you don't know the meaning or context of that word means we're up here and you're down here, and you need to shut up. I realize it wouldn't be as concise but I wonder sometimes if simply stating things in more everyday terms would be more effective (rather than using these academic terms of art, which are presumed to be known by anyone wanting to participate in the conversation).    Another thing is, if you (general you, not you personally) use terms of art like these, which of course you know substantial portion of your audience is not going to be familar with, then I think it's fair to assume that the purpose of the commentary is to feel superior, rather than to effect change."

"That doesn't make any sense. People with an IQ of 150 are also one in a million. Most people can't do what they can. It's the automatic corollary of your statement about the person with an IQ of 70.  Then you forget that this is IQ. It could easily be that even in the region ~100 IQ, any given person in that group can't do all the other things that people in that group can do because they differ by something else. There could be a curve for lots of other things, such as having a certain proportion of muscles, abstract thinking, social ability, resistance to stress, conscientiousness, etc. IQ is not the only thing that losing out on can be pretty bad for you, and you may need certain combinations to do various things. We don't really know where people are in this soup, though, which is why genetics generalization is dangerous, and it's unwise to bet against yourself, but it doesn't mean it's not there.  &gt; There is little a person cannot accomplish given they put the required effort into it.  This is directly contradicted both by your other point and by reality. A person with 100 IQ can't accomplish the kinds of things you need 150 IQ to accomplish, and a person cannot be a professional basketball player without meeting certain reach expectations. ""put the required effort into it"" is also not something that is magically granted to people - what about an athlete that gets constantly injured? For many, that ends their entire athletic career. What if they are too busy working 2 jobs to support themselves? Without even getting into influences of mental state and no we're not born with the same exact mental state according to any study you look at. Not everyone has the ability to grind at a thing, often that actually requires either intense fear or intense interest in the thing, and, again, not everyone is granted that. And, finally, not everyone gets the same results from grinding at a thing. And some scope of results is only possible if you were grinding at the thing since age 5, and that's going to be your parents not you, so it's pretty useless for most people. How many soccer stars that didn't play from a very young age are there?  Unless, of course, you're saying that the ""little"" category includes all the things people care about these days because nobody feels like they can be special without accomplishing some great feat anymore. Yes, much larger groups of people can become a decent woodworker as opposed to a great woodworker but it doesn't feel worth it to a lot of people and you won't earn any recognition from it. People are not too interested to hear that they can be average or slightly above average at a lot of activities because this has been significantly devalued by society and globalization where you're constantly bombarded by the best of the best."

As a guy especially, girls don't seem to have any problem telling you you're too skinny and making the implication you're unattractive for it. Being skinny isn't as stigmatized so they don't feel bad about saying it, but for guys it's also not considered a positive attribute."

"You're missing the point. There is no reason to assume Jesus existed. If you tell me something exists, short of the proof being in my face or obvious relative to one's knowledge, the burden is on you to prove it exists.  It would change everything because the central myth/fable/story behind the religion would be considered bs and thus everything that flows from Jesus' birth and death would be suspect. The whole origin myth, the Earth is 6,000 years old, etc. etc. all that nonsense would be easily dismissed. All of that is predicated on the fact that this being existed and died, providing legitimacy to the myth.

For example, you could write that 10 page paper for English 202 and use 20 *real* citations with *real* quotes. Estimated time to finish it: ~30-40 hours.  Or you can just use fake citations and finish the thing in about 3-5 hours.  Who does this hurt? Literally no third party is harmed by this practice. What about yourself? Well, spending dozens of hours on a worthless paper when you're already a great writer that knows how to press a button in a library to get any source, any time - *that's* just straight up self-harm."

Anyways, fast forward a few years and I'm pretty conflicted by different ideologies and the idea of death, which was pretty terrifying. I went to visit my birth mother a few hours away and asked her what she believed.  ""Well, do you remember how it was before you were born?"" No.. ""Well that's what I believe happens after you die, there's nothing afterwards, so I believe you have to do things that make you happy, that make you feel alive, because once it's over, it's over.""  Maybe it was because it was someone I loved dearly or maybe it was something I always believed deep down, but since then I've not been able to stand religion, I've felt slowly driven towards a more militant stance against it and tbh, I'm pretty thankful for it."

"I agree with everything your saying!   Mine was a simple song lyric, but it seemed so profound as my thinking previously had been contentious on the topic. I believed that I should have as much control over my life as possible while also thinking that so much happens in life ""to"" me.   The lyric said,  ""What should I scream for? This is my theme park."" Who said it matters very little. The fact is that the entirety of my existence is completely up to me now. Yes, as you are maturing and becoming smarter and wiser, things can happen to you And they have huge affects on who you are and where you go and what you do, but once you grow to a point of competency and clear perception of reality. Things can happen, and no matter what happens I can respond how I like without letting the happening thing control my perception.  I see that life is my park, I'm going to stride and stroll as I like. It's all about having the right perspective.  If a loved one is intentionally causing me trouble then intentionally don't talk to that person for a few weeks, cutting their ""pay"". They all want in to this theme park, and if they're a trouble maker then they're out or I'll at least put your ass on the roller coaster that'll make you want to leave.   Another thing someone said who backed this up was a fellow coworker/waiter at a restaurant who spoke of ""controlling the tides and not letting them control you"". You are the expert and they are the amateurs. I used to let a single table control and ruin my shift if they were stupid assholes, but I finally learned that they are the tide and I can give them good service(and get good tips) all while not being a complete servant to their every whim. Example for those new waiters out their: some people will want you to be back at their table every 2-3 minutes for their entire visit which could be an hour or more. That's a shit ton of walking and working and mind racing when you have 20 other people to tend to also. Fuck em. Get to their table and if you have a lot of tables near,  then do a pass and ask all tables quickly and loudly nearby if they need anything all at once and then once they have told you everything and you're sure there is nothing else then you ask again once more to be absolutely sure. Then go to work preparing everything,  if they forgot something then that is their fault, come back again in 5 to 6 mintues to check again.  If someone makes a mistake and tries to blame you, try to take their sodas off the check and just put waters. Some people are never happy, some people just want a friend. Flirt like a mother fucker especially if it's an old person. Make them like you as you do things how you want to do them. It's your theme park after all, why shouldn't everyone like the smooth operator.   If you're clear minded enough, you realize that life is your theme park and you run it how you want to. Nothing should bother you enough to make you truly unhappy. It's all in your perspective. See the silver linings. If your job sucks find a new one. If your living situation sucks change it. It's really up to you. If a bill hits and screws your credit, then your theme park just has bad credit. If your  path takes a turn and it's not where you thought you'd be then smoothly operate and stroll and stride right on back towards where your theme park should be.   Writing this down occasionally really helps me to get my own head right. I hope it helps someone else too.   TL:DR  Only you control your perspective and your path, control the tides instead of letting them control you."

"Mental pain can often be as bad or worse than physical pain, and studies have shown that that mental pain can often register very similar to physical pain.  If anything, I'm mostly using physical pain as an example here because most people are still in the camp of ""mental pain doesn't really exist and doesn't really matter"", so if I bring up chronic pain maybe they'll understand a little bit better. The fact that you think the distinction is relevant at all just seems to prove my point.  I mentioned depression, that's not physical pain, but an example of chronic pain. Maybe you would have been better saying that he only meant actually transient pain (now we're really picking out what is legitimate pain), but then...  ...there's PTSD, also mental pain, and a good example of very non-optional mental pain that happens long after trauma, what people here have codified as ""legitimate pain"", has passed. No, people with PTSD are not some weak people who just want to suffer, they are just struggling with something very difficult.  People that would be helped by taking the approach of: ""I do not need to suffer, even though bad things have happened."" But it's a much more open ended approach than what some people have suggested here in responses. One shouldn't feel like they have to suffer, and one should attempt to oppose their suffering whenever they can if it's not useful, but one is not ""choosing"" to suffer if they are dealing with a lot of pain, and nobody really should say someone is choosing to suffer from pain they did not themselves invent or cause nor the suffering that they themselves did not invent or cause."

Turns out maths isn't too difficult if you sit down and do it with some discipline. Then I came to love it.   Later this month, I have my graduation in which I will be formally awarded my masters degree in mathematics, which I passed with distinction.   I think ""talent"" is such bullshit.   **edit** since you're apparently into music, under the assumption that music is strongly tied to mathematics is pretty clear, I once found a cool video explaining why equal temperament ""works"" as a good compromise for tuning the notes on a piano to minimise the bias towards certain keys.

I love the idea of a genius pushed the boundary of human knowledge and the rest of us, very slowing, inching our way to the new frontier.  But very unfortunately,  take Einstein for example, it had been 101 year after Einstein put forth the idea of Relativity,  but what percentage of the population truly understand this idea.

Then someone explained to me what no one was explaining in media outlets in those days.  How small numbers can have huge impacts on large and sophisticated systems.  And even if the impact over-all is small, to the individual that impact can be enormous because human beings are pretty small in the grand scheme of things.  Small numbers on a big system can affect us greatly and that's what we should be paying attention to because that's the POV we particularly care about.

"""No you're not.""  In high school, I was the dark ""I hate the world, I'll kill this, I'll kill that"" kid for a while. I was talking about this one particular classmate I hated, saying something like ""I will kill this bitch"", and my best friend at the time was just listening quietly, and said something like ""No you're not.""  At that point I realized he was right, and I was all talk, and I was a better person than I was making myself out to be. I realized being all dark and murder-y wasn't cool at all - not anywhere close to what I thought it was - and that's when I stopped talking shit, and became myself."

"I was stunned when I first entered law.  I expected nothing but really smart lawyers and professionalism.  Those naive ideas were quickly smashed to bits. And some lawyers just do not get that jurors are not stupid. They pay attention and even if a juror knows that they shouldn't impute an attorney's bad behavior to their client, it does have an effect on a juror who gets sick of the bullshit and wasting of everyone's time."
"When I was 15 or 16 I was on the bus with two friends. One is very tall and slim, the other is super petite.  It was coming close to winter so we were talking about boots we'd seen that we liked. One of my friends said how difficult it is to find boots that don't leave a gap (between her leg and the boot), my other friend agreed.  I sarcastically said ""oh, you poor things, your legs are so slim, that must be so hard for you both""  One of them shot me this look and said ""oh shut up, curvy and pretty""  I know everyone says (especially to teenage girls) that everyone is insecure about different things blah blah, but until my friend said that I hadn't really seen it in action, and it was kind of, reassuring.   I've kinda kept it with me as a reminder not to compare myself to other women, we all have things we'd like to change, but we also have things other people envy, so there's no point getting worked up about it."

"When I heard about how Jews were pretty much the leadership of communist Russia and when the communist attempted another take over of Germany the leadership again where Jewish and the Jewish bankers were responsible for the hyper inflation of the Weimar Republic.  Then I understood why they were hated and targeted by the Nazis.  People think Jews were killed and opressed for no reason but all this dates back to the French Revolution.  A historian said ""most people think the world was shaped after WW2, more educated think WW1, and the best educated look to the French Revolution.""  Our modern world started when a Rothschild agent road to England and said the UK and allies lost at Waterloo.  That's Jewish central banking controlled Germany and France at this point, and after that a Jewish centeral bank was formed in England.  US resisted the centeral bank and burnt the first one to the ground, congress destroyed the next.  Andrew Jackson is where is started to go downhill with the US second bank.  Wasn't until 1913 while most of congress wasn't the federal reserve snuck through and became apart of the GOV  [the act is one of the most anti-American things ever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act)  [quotes by men and even progressive Woodrow Wilson](http://www.themoneymasters.com/the-money-masters/famous-quotations-on-banking/)  [this cartoon simply explains how baking sort of works, except the red crest in the head of the leader is the Rothschilds who have a stake or outright own all the worlds centeral banks.](http://youtu.be/tGk5ioEXlIM)  I laugh when Forbes talks about the ""richest people"" in the world.  Rothschilds and private owners of the Banks, many being royalty and the barons of  control the printing press. They can become trillionaires overnight.  Remember when the fed couldn't account for a trillion dollars? During those senate hearings?  All those heads of the fed are Jewish.  So there are booms and busts, what people have built and created are bought up during recessions, and this is globally.  We have new royalty, and this is global royalty.  But I will be labeled a anti-Semite when you point out the massive amount of Jewish influence in the US economy in media, banking, academia.  Israel IQ is in the 90's, so the ""Jews are just really smart"" is a fallacy. Jews practice nepotism, when one Jew gets into power he positions other Jews to follow and hires them over others.  I saw this myself at Oppenheimer. It was ridiculous to see Jewish managers hire Jews only and they got a fast track no matter their performance.  Nobody likes to talk about this. Nor the USS Liberty incident that happened because the ship intercepted the Israeli military executing Egyptian surrendered soldiers in the thousands. That's why they air attacks and torpedoed the ship.  This is why a lot of people don't like what Jews are doing. Not all Jews are like this of course, many are on the outside.  But like Islam, when your book says goyim were put on this earth to serve Jews and each Jew will have 2000 goyim slaves it should be upsetting.  Look up the Jewish involvement in the slave trade and you will be shocked. This is justified in Judaism. A reason Jesus hated the Jewish beliefs. The biggest slave markets were located right next to Jewish banks and Jews owned and insured the ships.  Jews were chased out of many European countries and kill for a reason. Islam didn't allow them to do the things they did in Europe so they lived peacefully there.   This questioning of Judaisim started way back when we were forced to play draddle in middle school. The fucking Jews teach children this is chocolate gold coins... I mean fucking LOL..  I will get downvoted and labels and anti-Semite and someone will nitpick the facts or timeline to discredit what I am saying but it's true.  People the say the protocols of Zion is a forgery, but the Jews hated the tsars and blocked them from American money to fight the Jewish created communist movement.  So many things the book says legit have happened and are happening. It's un settling.  I know i will get downvoted for uncomfortable truths, which there are many.  Things like the trail of tears totally leave out important information. Like the funkily were told weeks in advance and they picked their own guides. I army wasn't really I invovled in the whole thing.  Instead people pick up trash books like ""a peoples history of the United States, a joke book no real historian uses.""  Much like how the afrocentrists have populated this myth about Eygptians being subs sharan African, and applying that to the Phoenicians in Northern Africa."

"This has just reminded me of when I went to global gathering a few years back.  The only 2 possessions I have ever really owned that meant much to me are a wooden boat of my granddads (only about 7/8"" across the base and 4"" ish high) and my gold chain. The chain because it's a family tradition that you get it when you come of age.  At the time I went to global, I hadn't been back ""home"" to Malaysia. for a long time. I was 24 at the time, and hadn't been back for about 10 years. Been about 4 times in total, I live in England. So that chain meant the world to me because having not been back for so long, it felt like my only realy link to the family as a whole. It was snatched from roudn my neck (grabbed the back and snapped it) by some random thief at the festival and I couldn't get it back. I outright squared up in the middle of the tent but didn't know what he'd done with it.  At this point, I had just come up on MDMA (I'm quite lucid on it though and it was fairly pure). I'd lost my mate a while ago and was chatting to some random group. Long story short, 1 of the girls in that group literally just chilled with me for about 2/3 hours whilst I was speechless and just in shock. I couldn't even cry, I was just emotionally numb. This was a girl I had known for about 30 minutes, if that, before it happened.  It wasn't anything in particular she said, but more the fact she was willing to do it at all. I went from being relatively pessimistic about people anyway and obviously feeling like the world was collapsing around me to well and truly having my faith in people restored by this simple act.  It also reminded me what I love about the dance scene so much. With everyone drinking in normal clubs and things, people get a bit lary and generally act like dickheads. But when you're at the kind of place where a lot of the crowd are on pills/MDMA (euphoric highs) it's just a totally different vibe. As horrible as it is that I lost my chain, the simple actions of that girl really cemented why I felt so at home in those kind of events."

I was in a car accident that totaled my vehicle.  I was extremely upset and crying because the car was only a few months old (also my first accident).  The police officer saw the empty baby seat in the back and said just be thankful I was alone and no one was hurt.  That one simple statement completely changed my perspective on material possessions.  I don't even buy new cars anymore.

I remember this quote too! Completely changed how I approached things :)
"See, I have met with Muslims.  I serve with Muslims.  I serve with men and women who don't tolerate the minority Islamic extremists, and go above the peaceful and complicit majority.  Actually trying to stop the violence.  People who recognize that prayers can be a waste of time and lives, when it is time for action.   In regards to those Christian wackjobs? The violent ones tend to end up in jail.  They also don't decide wearing a vest of explosives and detonating it inside of a busy shopping center or a packed church of a different sect of Christianity is the best way to prove their religion.  A majority of Christians will also go to any means necessary to eliminate or reduce the damage those twisted individuals may cause.   There are a lot of problems within a lot of religions.  The problem is the inherent culture.  The majority of Muslim nations tend to view violence as an acceptable part of their culture.   &gt;Surveys of muslims in Egypt, Palestine, Israel and Tunisia show that at least one out of three women is beaten by her husband. The indifference to this type of violence stems from attitudes that domestic violence is a private matter and, usually, a justifiable response to misbehaviour on the part of the wife. *Selective excerpts from the Koran are used to prove that men who beat their wives are following God’s commandments. These religious justifications, plus the importance of preserving the honour of the family, lead abusers, victims, police and health care professionals to join in a conspiracy of silence rather than disclosing these offences.* However, a fair reading of the Koran shows that wife abuse, like genital mutilation and “honour killings” are **a result of culture rather than religion.**  The culture is either of violence or of passiveness.  The violent minority are easily able to dominate the passive majority.  I'm glad you host community outreach events. Seriously.  But, it isn't about religion.  It's about the culture of violence that dominates the ""Religion of Peace""."

"""Listen, there's something I must tell. I've never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn't matter a bit if you don't understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as you are, even if you don't know it. Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play - exuberance which is its own end. Basically, there is the gesture. Time, space and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatsoever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone! There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.""    - Alan Watts"

"Alright, since /u/InNeedOfDirection wanted more too.... a little back story, I was 16 yea old skinny white kid hustling speakers and making fiberglass subwoofer boxes for people. I put one up on craigslist and this big black dude in an Escalade came to buy it. He asked if I make it and hired me on the spot because he couldn't find anyone who knew how to build with fiberglass. My best friend was working for this rich guy in a Ferrari racing club doing paint prep and learning to paint cars, so I called him the next day and he got hired on the spot. It turned into a business for my boss and all his buddies to get their cars worked on for cheap and also launder money they made selling drugs and pimping.   It was great because we were young and stupid and all his customers wanted stupid shit for their cars: Fiberglass door panels with 15"" Screens and 6 speakers, bright orange caprice on 28"" rims (I welded the lift kit for it because I was used to lifting my buddy's toyota trucks), lambo doors on everything, screens everywhere, speakers everywhere. Nowadays I cringe at the stuff we did and honestly the shitty work we did but hey, everyone was happy.   One weekend I was working late at the shop on this guy's Jaguar. We were painting it, lambo doors, and trunk sub/amp install. I was doing a full trunk install and I was instructed to make a gun rack that would pop out with a button. So I'm installing Servos and waiting for some fiberglass to dry around the gun they gave me to work with when someone busts into the shop.   It was my boss and the owner of the car. They were moving fast and yelling, looking for this dude's gun. I had to destroy my fiberglass work and handed him his gun completely wrapped in blue painters tape. He goes ""yea I'ma need this tonight"" He started ripping off the tape as they ran outside and peeled off in a Charger I had never seen before.   My boss came in on Monday and acted like nothing happened, so I never asked about it."

"My father always did this. He never said ""You do it because I say so"". Instead, even when I was a child he would speak to me, explaining why I had to behave this way, or do things in that order, etc. And I feel like this helped me, for example, to keep a good behavior during my first teen years. One thing he used to openly talk about with me when I was in middle school was how he wanted me to not get bad habits like smoking and how, as a loving father, he didn't want me to become addicted to anything. He often said:  ""If you started smoking, I could just force you. 'Do NOT smoke. You want to smoke? Well, you must not, especially in my house!' or 'If you start smoking I'll sell away your games!'. But what would I get? I would get that as soon as you're out there with your friends you would smoke as much as you want, thinking ""In your face, Pa'! I smoke when and how much I want!""  Instead, wouldn't it be better to gently tell you how much I care for your health and how unhealthy smoking really is? Wouldn't it be better, say, to tell you about how your uncle had a heart attack because he smoke too much and couldn't nor wanted to stop?""

"I was in undergrad and failing out of pre-med. I was really miserable and thought my life was over.    A friend took me to the beach to a new resturant at the end of the pier to cheer me up. When we got there the place was still under construction.   She then turned to me and said ""sometimes shit happens. Let's just get on with our lives"" and she proceeded to walk back to her car.   I realized then that she'd driven me an hour to a place she knew wasn't open just to make that point.   Profoundly changed how I take bad events in my life. Sometimes, shit happens."
I think society makes it so that everybody keeps certain emotions bottled up... and everyone's just looking for something to dump the frustration on.
"I'm so sorry about your baby girl. I have helped over 300 or so families with the loss of a child. If you would like to PM me, please do.  You need to grieve, and people simply don't know what to say. The death of a child frightens people, and they say something, thinking it helps.  Be good to yourselves. Getting away was smart.   Grieve as long as you need to, however you need to, unless you feel like either of you are going over the edge.  Don't let anyone tell you how to feel.   It isn't their baby that is gone.

"Several years ago I was talking with my brother outside his house (he bought *just* before the crash), which he was on the verge of losing. Our father was dying, his high school sweetheart turned baby momma to wife to future ex-wife was having a kid with someone else, and he was still looking for a reasonable income job after losing the job he had for about 15 years.   I asked him why he bought the house, which was the source of a lot of trouble in addition to everything else toppling over in his life. I will never, ever forget his response.  **""It wasn't supposed to be this way.""**  No, of course not. No one plans on their wife cheating on them, their employer abusing them and shitting all over them, their property value tanking, their dad dying at 61 because of health complications.  It was then that I realized no matter what, you can never account for all the variables. You can plan all you want, but sometimes shit just *happens*. You can't do anything about it. I'm not a worst case scenario person, but I definitely consider a much wider range of possibilities when I'm thinking of something, both positive and negative."

"I've struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time. I had a coworker who I opened up to about how I had such trouble making decisions because I was always worried about making the wrong choice. He said, ""Life is all about not knowing what's going to happen, and then doing something anyways."" Maybe it was because he was an older man and seemed very wise, but I think back on that discussion often when I am feeling paralyzed with worry."

"That's how my mother was. I feel like she did a decent job in my childhood, but I am so screwed as an ""adult"". Which I should probably take responsibility for by now...  I remember camping with a wilderness club she was a member of. She always brought me along to events/places where children weren't really supposed to be but I acted appropriately enough where most of the time it wasn't an issue. This club actually really liked me.  Anyways, we were camping and I was doing the usual kid stuff; running around, climbing trees, and reading books. Apparently some woman told my mother she would never let her kids act like that.  That night or the next three guys in their twenties came stumbling to camp soaking wet. They drove their bosses truck onto a sandbar and the tide came in, drowning the truck and almost them too.  Turns out one of the guys was that same woman's son.  Something I still think is hilarious."

Luckily, I had as my advisor a guy who was a former GM at a Big Tech Company, a VP at Another Big Tech Company, and was at the time the CTO of a Massive Media Company. We had coffee one day and I asked him if he ever worried that he was making the wrong decision.  ""No!"" The tone of his voice almost made it sound like I had asked a ridiculous question, but that's just how he speaks. ""Look, so what if you make the wrong decision? Did you make the best decision you could at the time? And if new data comes along, can you make a new decision? I never worry about it, because I know I can always change direction if things are going bad.""  That completely changed how I thought about everything in life, from leadership to careers to money."

"I don't contribute to many threads on reddit. Mostly just a lurker, but I got to reading this thread and thought that I should contribute with some wisdom from my grandfather. Bit of background information about him beforehand. My grandfather was a WW2 veteran, served two tours and was among those included at the Battle of the Bulge; four purple hearts, one of the most decorated to serve from the area I grew up in.Needless to say, he's what the world would consider ""old school"" now. The man didn't say much, but when he did it was always prefaced with him patting the seat next to him and saying: ""C'mere. Let's talk for a minute."" So. I'm going to share with you two pieces of wisdom he shared with me. The first one about life. **""I don't understand what the big fuss is about. Life isn't that damn hard. You get up, eat a good breakfast. You go to work. You come home, spend time with the people you love. The next day, you do it all over again. Pretty damn simple.""**   And then the one that he shared with me as a child. I was a very troubled child growing up, very angry at the world for reasons I didn't quite understand and I'll not get into here. But he pulled me aside one day when I was 9 years old, and while I didn't quite understand at the time, I've never forgotten these words: **""Calm down. You were born a man. You were given those broad shoulders and firm foundation for a reason. Someday, you'll have a great many burdens. Your own and others to carry, and that's what you'll do, because you're a man. Your responsibility is to live and make your corner of the world a better place than what it was when you came into it.""** The only regret I have about my grandfather dying, is that more people didn't get to meet him."

"It's funny this was brought up because I was thinking this on my commute to work earlier. I had a random thought of my mom saying, ""you need to quit that, it won't make you better"" (referring to smoking weed at the time).   She's open to weed (me too to this day), but she saw I was smoking everyday and saw me using it for emotional aid.   As small as it sounds I kept thinking about and feeling 'off'. I slowly just gave up weed and some other bad habits (fidgeting around when stressed, pulling my hair, and worse)."

"To be honest, I've found that I usually do in those cases. When I need to rush something, I can still save time doing it over, versus doing it right.  Real world example for me. If I put absolutely everything into writing say, a 20 page research paper, it could take me 100 hours. But I only have 10 hours to produce a good one. I can write it in 5 hours, and rewrite it to make it better in another 5 hours. Still won't be as perfect as the 100 hour paper, but more than good enough for client standards.  I don't think using perfection as your metric is very useful in most real world cases because perfection is far more costly than ""good enough"". So often not having enough time to do something perfectly doesn't mean you don't have time to do it well."

"Yeah, it's called a counseling sheet.  Basically, in the military, paperwork is the very last resort. It's assumed that if you've gotten to the point where you're writing someone up for a problem, you have exhausted all other possible options and that the person is totally irredeemable. So, even a non-punitive counseling sheet will annihilate your semi-annual evaluation and destroy your chances of promotion along with it, and administrative punishment will completely torpedo your career.  With good men, even egregious fuck-ups are corrected with pain. We had a dude get alcohol poisoning while underage and got found in a ditch 10 miles east of San Diego; he was a good Marine, so Top basically said, ""You are my bitch until you turn 21."" Dude worked 7 days a week, 12 hours a day for six months... but he got no paperwork, and he got promoted on-time. If he had been a shitbag, Top would've thrown paperwork at him and gotten him busted down. Politely.  The standard punishment in my shop was raking the desert for several hours. 110 degrees, a rake, and nothing but sand to rake into tidy rows. It was unpleasant, but it definitely beat a counseling sheet.  ""Pain or paperwork"" was the common refrain when you fucked up. No one ever chose paperwork.  Incidentally, the same thing happens in the civilian world. When your boss stops bitching you out in person and starts sending polite emails about how you've been screwing up, you're already halfway out the door."

"I'm saying honest income inequality isn't about class envy or wealth envy, which is what C.K.'s quote is about.

I grew up a hard core democrat. My family was heavily involved with the city and its politics. A few of my cousins and I were able to join in on private city hall meetings.  It was then I found out how corrupted/corruptible the city was.  Nothing happened in that city without some type of pay off to the city council or commissioners. I finally put two and two together and realized why the poor areas were poor and dirty and the rich areas stayed nice and clean.  I noped out and moved out of the county vowing never to return. To this day there are people that are still on the council seats and the ones I knew that were working the grunt jobs are now in charge and are corrupted too.  I am too honest to be in politics.

"As someone who coaches young kids, I always try to keep an eye out for this. Maybe that kid ""just isn't trying"" because s/he is stressed about being yelled at by a teacher or bullied by a classmate. Maybe something is going on at home and they're distracted and upset. Sometimes they're just feeling under the weather or didn't sleep well! The solution isn't to berate, punish, or scream at them.  Of course I know all this and probably still get it wrong 75% of the time, though I keep working on it."

"I find it does the opposite.  It makes you look at it closer, and oftentimes you'll find intricacies that you might not have noticed otherwise.  It puts you in the mind of the artist, it even opens up a kind of dialogue in a way.  You'll find yourself asking questions like ""why does this make me feel this way?""  ""Is this what the artist intended?""  ""Is he going against tradition, why or why not?""  There's a ton of questions you can ask about art, and answers to those questions can lead to even more questions."

"Except maybe even the random ""outrage culture"" stuff has legitimate grievances also. A professor of mine in college that taught Black Studies mentioned a great strategy in dealing with racists offensive, and I believe that it also works well to remember it when you might've been the offender.  Basically, it was summed up by the phrase ""agree (with yourself) to be offended, but stay connected (with the offender)."" Meaning that if you feel that you've been offended, agree with your initial instinct and don't apologize for having been offended; however, when dealing with trying to correct the offense, stay connected with the offending party through dialogue. Don't resort to character attacks. Don't put yourself above them from a ""moral"" standpoint. Talk through what happened.  If both parties do this the end result will almost always be a clarification of what was said or done (""Oh, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant at all by that statement/action), or an epiphany of the damage that was caused (""Oh, I'm sorry. I hadn't realized that what I said/did was so egregious."")"

"""Nothing is true, everything is permitted.""  It made me think about how things we regard as 'true' are really just general consensus. We collectively permit them to be considered true. In this way, reality is a social definition, and can change.  I picked the phrase up from the Isis album ""In the absence of truth"" (which is awesome), then in turn from [The Illuminatus! Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy) (which is a mind fuck), but it originates from the Slovenen novel [Alamut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamut_(Bartol_novel)); the original phrase was ""Nothing is an absolute reality, all is permitted""."

Additionally I am a very closed of person and the couple of times I shared some stuff that was going badly in my life after my friends had been encouraging to talk to me about it they ignored it afterwards. It was hurtful like my problems did not really matter. I know that is not what they meant. But if you encourage people to share issues with you then just being nice when they are talking is not going to fix the issues if they are real. For many people talking fixes nothing and just makes things more real and painful.
You still raised a fair point
You can't control other's actions or emotions. You can only control your response to them.   Forgiveness isn't saying what happened is ok. Or that the person is welcome back into your life. Forgiveness is accepting that the past couldn't be any different. Forgiveness is making the choice to move forward.   You can still love your body even if you don't accept it and want to change it.

Guitar he was playing was not tuned and it looked like not tunable at all. I asked him, how can you play this thing, why don't you at least try to tune it, and he answered:  **To be heard, that's what important.**  I translated it as loud is more important than well tuned, and probably skill might help, but you might do without it."

Continuity of care? A lot of things that you think would draw you to a specialty like subject matter become routine and dull quickly. Its not like you are discovering new things in a field, you are just memorizing complicated algorithms. It's the things like I mentioned above that end up keeping someone interested, for all you know learning about endocrinology is great fun for you, but actually doing all the secretarial stuff of ensuring someone's thyroid hormone is sufficient in the context of other diseases could actually end up being mostly just annoying for you"

Some things are best left unsaid
"I was 12 and I looked up to this other kid.  ""I can't stand you, you're so egocentric.""  What began as a wildfire that swept my self esteem into oblivion grew into the relentless systematic destruction of any semblance of pride I ever had. And of course it was terrible. All that time wasted on pointless self-inflicted torment. I was like a superstitious evangelical parent violently exorcising their demonic children except I was the child being exorcised, too. When the dust settled and the smoke cleared, I had laid claim to the dubious achievement of ego death.   However... it did launch me on a decades long crusade that continues to this day to take responsibility for my personal ethics. Everybody still tells me I'm too hard on myself, but I believe that discipline has enabled me to become the kind of friend a friend wants to have. I've cultivated a habit of integrity, reliability, patience, empathy, support, and cooperation that has become a reputation that, for once, I **am** actually proud of. [](/twismug ""Okay, yes, I just paraphrased the Elements of Harmony, but I guess that's why they appealed to me in the first place."")  And everyone who knows me also knows very well that if I am ever proud of something, it's a big deal.   It may not be all that impressive, but I'm grateful to have gotten through it all the same. All in all, my lesson for y'all is this:  Don't elevate other people to a godlike standard beyond reproach.  Don't take any other person's word as gospel truth.   Observe the world, and base your decisions on evidence you know, not conjectures you fear or hope for."

"Two things that I refer back to every now and then in my personal life and whenever I feel like I'm confused and struggling.   The first was the definition of love which was ""effectively willing the true good of the beloved."" A fantastic definition that I believe captures what realy is true love. True love is focused on the beloved, not on yourself. True love focuses on their truly good needs. True love is willing meaning that it shouldn't feel like a chore. Finally, true love is effective meaning it's not just a statement or a profession but it's accompanied by action. Without those elements working together, you have either lust or infatuation.  The second was in regards to racism but I've found the logic to be good in many situations regarding personal offenses. It was a strategy in how to correct or seek closure on offenses. The statement was ""agree to be offended, but stay connected."" Meaning that if you feel that you've been offended, agree with your initial instinct and don't apologize for having been offended; however, when dealing with trying to correct the offense, stay connected with the offending party through dialogue. Don't resort to character attacks. Don't put yourself above them from a ""moral"" standpoint. Talk through what happened. If both parties do this the end result will almost always be a clarification of what was said or done (""Oh, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant at all by that statement/action), or an epiphany of the damage that was caused (""Oh, I'm sorry. I hadn't realized that what I said/did was so egregious."")  These were two of the most important lessons I've learned. It's taught me what true love is supposed to be and it's taught me how to defend myself against offending parties without hostility (and how to receive criticism from those I might've unintentionally offended)."

But no matter how much she loves what she learns, losing her father was the hardest thing that has happened to her and i would be realy worried if she kept working there."
"I used to be an angry child. Not like constantly angry, but if some kid pissed me off or tried to stand over me, I'd punch them in the face. I got into trouble for it quite a lot at school even though I was a good student, I was just known for retaliating to bullying by beating up the bully. Anyway, one day there was a bit of a misunderstanding - I playfully hit a girl I sat next to while we were joking around, but the teacher assumed I was just beating up girls now (I've never hit a girl in anger to this day) and called my parents in. What my mum said had nothing to do with the incident with the girl, she believed I was just playing around with her, but she had gotten sick of me getting into fights and this call from school was the last straw. She said this:        ""You think you're some big hard fighter, but you listen to me now. One day you're gonna hit the wrong person, and you are going to go DOWN. BIG TIME. You think it's justified to hit people who are annoying you? One day you're gonna punch someone who is going to punch you back harder. You're gonna hit someone who has friends that will stomp you into the dirt. You're gonna attack someone who carries a knife and he's going to cut you open. If you don't change your fucking attitude, you're going to get it big time. Not from me, or your father, but you will hit the wrong person and after that you'll never touch someone again"".        I was 8 at the time, and what she said and the tone of her voice as she said/screamed it at me freaked me out. I have never got into a serious fight since then, and I can recall two instances (one when I was 12, another when I was 16) where someone was trying to bully me and I walked away instead of fighting because of what she said. I'm now known as someone who won't even get into verbal conflicts with people. If someones got an issue and wants to argue, I tend to just say ""I don't care, I'm not interested in fighting"" and walk away. I used to think it was fine to stand up for oneself with violence when I was a kid, but now I think it's far more appropriate to stand up for oneself by being the bigger person and walking away."

"2 things have stuck with me for my life thus far.   1. My high school Econ teacher told the class 'just do the right thing.'  Find a wallet on the ground? Just do the right thing. See someone in need - do the right thing. It's helped me make decisions on stopping and helping a guy who was stuck in a wheel chair and couldn't move it. - and many other small decisions in my life :)  2. I was going to give my boss a ride home from work one day, (he lived 2 blocks away) and we were mid conversation. So instead of him walking I was going to give him a ride.   He opened the door to my car and it was trashed. Completely filled with garbage. And he said he was going to walk instead.   When I got to his house, he said he didn't like that my car was so gross and it was disgusting. (It was). And he said when he sees things like that, it shows what's going on in my head and reflects how I think.    He was absolutely correct.  I was disorganized, unmotivated, etc. once I started getting my life on track I started keeping my car clean. To avoid that embarrassing feeling of someone declining a ride with you because how disgusting you are. And how much more focused and motivated I am when I am a clean and organized person.

Small things like this make it a little less shitty.""   Obviously, to many of us standing in line like that wouldn't matter.  But to that kid it was a big deal, something small that made his life a little better - a moment of happiness in a sea of letdowns.   I don't know why but this really stuck with me, kind of an eye opener to really enjoy the things that make you happy. Things like Friday off, Saturday with no errands, getting that awesome drop in a game, spending an afternoon with your kids.

In the regards to bigger corporations with HR departments acting as a buffer a degree can help a lot. However smaller startups and companies that strictly deal with and understand the technical field understand that there are many different ways that you can attain the knowledge, heck like I said earlier I have a friend that taught himself to code after hating his old job and now he is doing incredibly well for himself.

I have never really had a lot of friends and it hit me hard.  I completely changed my worldview and started to look for the silver linings in everything. Don't give me wrong, I still have problems with anxiety and depression, but now I feel that I can identify when I'm unwell and that helps a lot.

I could also be a good chess player and it might be an even game.   In the case of talent working hard, the original statement doesn't mean that ""you're fucked when talent works hard"". Even if we assume the original statement is true, perhaps there are diminishing returns of talent where it becomes less and less relevant the harder you work. The original statement says nothing of how dominant hard working talent is versus simple hard work.   So no, it doesn't imply it,  rhetorically or otherwise."

My mind was blown! I struggled to sit in class, knowing that everything the professor was saying carried the weight of his own personal experiences, and my interpretations of what he was saying was clouded by my own personal experiences, meaning I could never truly understand the message being conveyed by any other human being, let alone the professor...

I just became aware, and my consciousness grasped my ego by its neck and said, 'caught you mother fucker.'  I was in the back seat of a car, him in the front seat. I don't remember the exact wording, and I know I will flub it. He said:  'The fact that I'm talking to you right now. The fact that I can communicate to you and you can hear me at this very specific moment in time. Proves that the 'real' you is connected to the 'real' me. We are one in the same.'

"So my sister is kind of an elitist bitch.  A few years ago we got into a fight.  It largely started because I was unaware of a job she had had years before.

Well about 7 years later it's becoming more and more apparent that my oldest nephew has developmental delays.  She's changed her attitude about my old job a lot since then.  She hasn't had her underlying mental illness treated though, so she realistically could fly off the handle any time we see her.

"&gt;From what I've seen the arguments against income inequality are more often than not about looking at one person's bowl and saying ""What the fuck, that's enough for like ten thousand bowls.

Bob's bowl contains a suburban home with a nice car, a lawn, and 40 hour work week. Cassandra's bowl has 3 jobs, a 1 hour window to see her kids each day except Sunday when she gets 4 hours, and an apartment in the ghetto.    I don't think there is anything wrong with Cassandra looking into Alice or Bob's bowls and saying ""This is unjust."" I don't think there is anything wrong with Bob looking into Alice's bowl and saying ""This is unjust."". I do think there is something wrong with Alice looking into Bob or Cassandra's bowls and saying ""Yep, that's enough, I earned mine and they has enough!"" or Bob looking into Cassandra's bowl and saying ""Yep, that's enough, I earned mine and they have enough!"" where ""enough"" means ""enough food to survive""."

"The Egg By: Andy Weir   You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me. And that’s when you met me. “What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?” “You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words. “There was a… a truck and it was skidding…” “Yup,” I said. “I… I died?” “Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said. You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?” “More or less,” I said. “Are you god?” You asked. “Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.” “My kids… my wife,” you said. “What about them?” “Will they be all right?” “That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.” You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty. “Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.” “Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?” “Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.” “Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,” “All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.” You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?” “Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.” “So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.” “Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.” I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had. “You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.” “How many times have I been reincarnated, then?” “Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.” “Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?” “Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.” “Where you come from?” You said. “Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.” “Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.” “Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.” “So what’s the point of it all?” “Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?” “Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted. I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.” “You mean mankind? You want us to mature?” “No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.” “Just me? What about everyone else?” “There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.” You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…” “All you. Different incarnations of you.” “Wait. I’m everyone!?” “Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back. “I’m every human being who ever lived?” “Or who will ever live, yes.” “I’m Abraham Lincoln?” “And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added. “I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled. “And you’re the millions he killed.” “I’m Jesus?” “And you’re everyone who followed him.” You fell silent. “Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.” You thought for a long time. “Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?” “Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.” “Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?” “No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.” “So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…” “An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.” And I sent you on your way."

"Ah, the old martial arts woo! I used to train with this guy (both students) for a couple years and lost track of him for some years after he left. The last time I saw him he was telling me how, after he left, he trained with some other Chinese guy (why are they always Chinese in these stories?) and, if he wanted to, he could hit me in the arm and it would break three days later.   ""Let me get this straight. You can punch me in the arm and three days later it'll break from that punch?""  ""Yes.""  My buddy I was with had to call him on it.  ""Ok do it to me. I'll sign a paper saying I asked you to do it and you're not responsible.""  ""I can't. I'm not allowed to abuse my skills.""  He then gets on his city bus, which had just arrived, and off he goes.

It shouldn't be a blind suggestion to go for it. It depends on what you are planning to go in for. There are many professions that would be challenging if you tried to start at your age (e.g. Law). Many professions where the company expects to give you years of training and have you grow with the company will be hard to get into.

You can't imagine that someone might escalate towards evil and madness, to be strong and prosperous?  I DIDN'T SAY PROBABLY PLEASE READ NEXT TIME.  The point is very simple. When someone tried to understand someone, if they make an effort, they don't necessarrilly assume that they're a person ""just like themselves,"" because people aren't all alike. They base the imagining on both their shared humanity, and their current opinions of the person (as, not being mindreaders, that is what they have, to go on). That, alone, does not get you to such certain conclusions.   And that was beside the point anyway!  Also, not ""rich people"". George bush, the devil himself. Obama (interesting how it's not always Barrack), the other devil himself. And BIG PHARMA, the province of the dominion of hell on earth.

"""I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I'm trying to understand: I keep making up examples.  For instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they're all excited.  As they're telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions.  You know, you have a set (one ball) - disjoint (two balls).  Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions on.  Finally, they state the theorem, which is some dumb thing about the ball which isn't true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say ""False!"". - Richard Feynman  I spent most of my education trying to work with abstract ideas: symbols, theorems.

She had said a lot of things previously defending her decision, but this was the first time that I really got it. That was 15 years ago, she is super happy with her husband and 2 kids.

"But sometimes, we Poles pretend internally we're OK. We try to be as western people are, like catching some positive thinking (and talking). It's so frustrating when it doesn't work ;) Yet, it's OK to be frustrated sometimes.  You said ""same old poverty"". I know. That leads to my most valuable ""quote"". Quit whining unless you do something about it. Here, in Poland they teach us insane amount of totally useless shit, teaching a young man how to earn for living is a kind of taboo, or maybe hardly anyone knows anything about it. Old commie way was: study, get a job. Like everything was dependent on some institutions, which just make everything work. But well, communism failed. Failed, but it's still alive. In said institutions, also, in people's minds. If you take the standard teaching, you are the perfect slave. You whine all your life about ""same old shit"", though you work your ass off. It's sad, I know.  There were people who told me they won't tell me how to figure out important things. I will have to do it myself. It's impossible otherwise. There are things which cannot be told or taught.  I think that's our, post communist coutry citizens, problem. To learn how to take care of ourselves independently. Not to trust any system or institution for this. You need knowledge? Learn. Don't depend on any program or course. You need money? Make things and sell them. Sell your time, sell your expertise. Just don't sell yourself, because that's where ""same old shit (poverty)"" comes from.  I'm not rich. But I know it's temporary. I feel rich. I buy good stuff instead of cheap stuff. I don't whine anymore, because there's so much to do before whining would be justified.  We, the Poles should be the best aware of that politicians lie, systems are scams and so on. We're smart enough to swim in this. We're smart enough to get along.  Let it be clear: in countries like Poland you have to be smarter and you have to work way harder than in most of western countries - just to get out of poverty. But it's well achievable. It's not a third world. It's a second world. It's like manual shifting car. A little harder to drive than automatic, but still a decent car. You can still win the race with it.  People who say ""same old shit"" just miss the point. The point is they are responsible for it. And if it's bad once - it could be bad luck, or someone else's fault. If it's bad all the time, it's your fault.  Living in a less friendly country can make us tougher. I feel for old people who can't adjust. But a lot of us still can.  I whined a lot about my jobs and bosses. But only the first time my good friend had to tell me to shut up and do something about it. After trying some more jobs I finally quit and started my own business. Because I personally think all jobs suck. I do almost exactly the same things as in my previous jobs. But this time I'm my own boss.  I'm lucky to have such friends. But it's not luck entirely. When I was a little kid my father told me to stick with better people than myself. He meant more successful ones. He was SO right.  My best friends are all like ""western"", super successful, first world type. Rich and smart. I learn a lot from them all the time. It's never the ""same old shit"" for me. We'll, maybe the same old struggle. But when I'm at least heading in some direction - I'm good."

But then he went into detail, ""You probably won't get an A because and A means you're outstanding, amazing, understand the material as well, or at least close to as well, as I do.

"Please note: this is in no way meant to downplay being bilingual. I'm not bilingual, and I'd like to be able to speak other languages like a mf pimp before I die. However, before we go on an ignorant American bashing rampage I wanted to tell the story of how when I was in the required college international study course my teacher tried to make us feel stupid by a story about how a guy from Texas went to France and asked a guy on a train if he spoke English. The French man ignored him (his original question wasn't worded very courteously) so the Texan said a bunch of crap about how snobby Europeans were on the train. Right before the French man got off the train, he folded up his newspaper, looked directly at the Texan, and said, ""I can speak English, and I can speak it better than you.""  That story and my teachers point pissed me off. I remember saying right afterwards: well, the guy was rude. And if a European travels 400 miles chances are they are in a place that speaks a different language. There is a little more urgency to teach other languages in schools. For Americans, we travel 400 miles and we are still speaking English.   Tdlr; Americans who only speak English still kick ass. Murcia.  I just re-read. Not the most cohesive thing I've written.

There should always be an eventual path out of whatever dark period you're experiencing.  And of course, a week can mean any short period of time.

"Damn I wrote a whole message and it erased on mobile. In short, it's hard to see what people are doing all around the world. I haven't seen Christians stand up about white idiots shooting up places. Not that I see a need for it. But you said that they do so that shows that there's a big discrepancy in what we see. I see my entire community gag at the thought of violence and acceptance of it constantly trying to fix the reputation that the media and disgusting ""Muslims"" have given us. We try our best and I'm not sure what else to do. But you're right. It's despicable that there are cultures, especially in the Muslim countries, that find the violence acceptable. It's ridiculous. And I promise that the Quran and Muhammad's teachings go against all of those things, saying even that you aren't even considered a believer until you want for your brothers and sisters in Islam what you want for yourself. And I guess that's only obvious to everyday Muslims, often in America, who try to fix the name that we get for the crazy idiotic countries around the world. It does suck now that culture has more of an impact on people than religion does. Which was my point when I said we, unfortunately, can no longer look at Muslims to see what Islam preaches. We have to turn to the book and the advice of the Prophet."
This seems.. disproportionate.

"I've always felt like people were staring at me - especially when I was a kid and it used to make me crazy.  Not because I was particularly shy - I wasn't - I've always been really outgoing but it just feels weird having people stare at you.  The truth is that I was very pale and blond as a kid with bright blue eyes and I made eye contact with everyone.  It's very likely people were staring at me because I was staring at them, but I just always felt like people were watching me.  One day, after a particularly odd slew of gawkers, I remember my mother telling me ""You probably just remind them of someone they know.""  She also said ""It's not personal if they don't know you.  You never know what's going on in peoples lives, they could've lost a daughter that looked like you.""  I've always held onto this.  So when people I don't know stare or are kind of rude to me I just sort of shrug it off.  It's not about me.  If a customer is rude to you at work, it's not about you.  If someone is driving like an asshat, may be their wife is in labor.  I just try to always keep it in mind, nothing is personal.  Even if people are staring at you, even if they are rude, even if they seem strange, it's not personal.  It's helped ease a lot of social anxiety for me."

"One day I went to see my math professor because I felt like I was falling behind from burning myself out, trying to know every atomic detail of every lesson. She replied, ""I'm sure you don't know the entire English vocabulary, and you only look up a word when you need it instead of trying to memorize an entire dictionary at once.""  This might be meaningless to most, but for anyone who tries overachieving for things they love, it's better to have momentum than truncating your progress with the details. Find out the specifics when you have the time, or when you truly need them."

He was literally the kind of guy who would get hammered in the night, then wake up and go for a jog, because why the fuck not?  There's nothing else more productive he could do at that given moment - so get that out the way.    It really taught me that life is really what you make of it.   It's fine to go to work on only 4 hours sleep - but only if you were doing something worthwhile.  Going out, socializing, finishing off a project , whatever, so long as it wasn't just sat idly on fucking reddit, or watching shitty fucking T.V.    He may not know it, but he taught me how to be happy.  At least for me, I have to work at life to be happy.  It doesn't mean every single second of the day is a joy, but I did learn that happiness is something I can create, it's not something that will simply come to me if I wait for it."

For religious folks, the suffering around the world is supposed to be our calling towards doing better and for spreading love. As humans, we're flawed and will make mistakes. As such, suffering may never be fully eradicated until (in the Abrahamich sense) the second coming.   I can only speak as a Christian but remember the myth of creation and the lessons it teaches. We were born in perfect harmony with nature but our free will led us to be flawed. God was wrathful towards us because we were insubordinate and constantly made mistakes against his main wishes. By giving his Son towards human suffering, he showed that (1) humans are flawed even in their relationship with God but that (2) God will heal all.

This [Ted Talk by James Kuntsler] (https://youtu.be/Q1ZeXnmDZMQ) completely changed the way I look at how our cities are built. It has had a profound impact in the way I now view our world.
"My parents had me young- mom 17 and dad 19. They divorced when I was 9 and my pops had a really hard time with it. When I was 15 or so, he was still struggling...couldn't keep a job, lived with his parents, etc. He was only in his mid-30's. I remember telling him, you have time! You can go back to school, join a band (he was a musician), do whatever!   Well, he didn't. He's 53 now. He hasn't worked since then. He had a stroke that left him without full use of one hand, he lost partial vision in one eye.   It breaks my heart to think of what he let pass by because he thought it was too late."
"I kinda feel this describes me.  Weird, with quiet introverted friends, I'm out going and will chat up any room be the life of a party.  With friends who I can't get a word in edge wise, friends who crave attention, and will chat anyone up within an ear shot, I turtle, turtle.  I can never really explain this, but maybe the above has an affect on it.  I feel this works the same with an intellectual  conversion/debate, maybe its nothing more than confidence sells."

I think it's a wise choice for older adults to go back to school after a couple of decades of life experience under their belt. I feel like they are generally in a better position to learn and less likely to piss away a valuable education by binge drinking and class skipping.

But at the end of a semester  of a class i sat next to this gurl the whole time, she told me that she always thought I was a real jerk. But after sitting next to me she thought I was nice and funny. I was, ""shit, am I giving off a jerk vibe."" Yes I was. Some.other chick called me stoic. That pissed me off until I looked it up in the dictionary. .. and realized it was accurate."

"It's understood though. I can't imagine how patient I'd be with Muslims if I wasn't Muslim and was someone who relied on the news and only saw the bad in the religion. Where are these people going to find the good side of Muslims? Definitely not Fox news or Bill Maher. So it's our responsibility to not only be patient, but also to understand why certain non Muslims have such a stubborn and skewed view of the religion. We need to understand why they think that way before we talk or discuss anything, otherwise only anger prevails."

"As a fairly far along German student (B2/C1) I have to ask: as a native speaker, is it really confusing and hard to read newspapers and magazines? Having a whole (and very similar-to-other-cases) case for reported speech (Konjunktiv-I) makes reading news very different and challenging for me. I got a copy of Der Spiegel for my birthday and it was just too hard after a few paragraphs of each article. My German teacher once told me that even native speakers get adjective endings wrong all the time, so it doesn't sound too unlikely that something that looks as weird as Konjunktiv-I looks in the middle of a sentence would get confusing. I hope to get to the point where I can read Der Spiegel and similarly difficult things really well, because that's the point when I will feel ready to do an academic exchange (hoping for 3rd year university!)."

"A co-worker let me live on her couch for a month while I was homeless in between high school and college. One day, when talking about some things she went through growing up, she shared with me this piece of advice that I've adopted as my mantra ever since. I definitely believe just remembering this as I go through life has helped me evolve as a better person, and it's really helped mediate my way through difficult situations and disagreements I may have with others when they go against it. It's really my center that I can always go back to when discerning whether I'm right or wrong, or *who* is right or wrong.  ""It's not what you say, it's *how* you say it.""  I'll never forget it. And I try to also impart it on whoever I meet when I feel they could use it or keepsake it until they'll need it too."
"The reason it continued afterwards was simply because of the negative thought patterns that persisted. It was 100% unavoidable. Had someone told me that I was feeling like shit still because of those thought patterns, I would have stopped immediately. But it took me a long time to figure it out myself; therapy did help.   It seems to me that you're trying to make this into something it's not. Some people *do* have the choice to stop suffering.   I'll tell you something else. Since I was depressed, I naturally befriended people who also had depression. I can't tell you how many of them told me that since all that they know is sadness, they noticed themselves doing things to keep themselves sad. It happens time and time again.   Sometimes suffering can be avoided. It can be if the individual is doing things to prolong the suffering."
"When I was in college a creative writing class I was given this definition of a writer:  ""A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than others"".  What that means to me is that when you take a craft seriously you judge your output more harshly and that makes it more difficult.   Any idiot can write a paragraph, but writing a piece of prose is hard."
"I work as a cook at a daycare and I run the dishwasher three times throughout the day, but the big dishes that need handwashing just get left until the end of the day. I enjoy that time for a few reasons. It signals to me that my day is almost over, I can look back and see all that I made and know that I did good and the kids enjoyed my food, and it's a low-key task to perform when my brain is tired from thinking all day so I can just sorta check out and do this last task, knowing I'm going home soon."
Growing up my father was a bit racist. He always had something negative to say about people of other races and religions.Naturally I picked it up too. One day teenage me was in the car with a newer friend and I said some derogatory. He stopped me and asked if I really felt that way. I thought about it and no I did not. That moment changed me.

I didn't understand it at the time, but what he meant was basically ""if you don't keep momentum in your life, then you will start to decay."" He lived to 86. As I started moving out of a depression that lasted a long time, I found that I was happier the more I just kept moving throughout the day, and that's when I finally understood his simple wisdom. It's kept me motivated for a long time, and I hope to pass it on.   Here's some more of his sayings:  ""Don't be a pimple on the ass of progress.""  ""Prior planning prevents piss poor performance""  ""Electrician work is easy, but shocking yourself and starting a fire is even easier"" (he was an electrician)  He had more, but those are what came to mind first."

"""The future is promised to no one.""  It works both as motivation and comfort when needed, especially in terms of college.  When I'm tempted to just procrastinate and justify it by thinking I'll be able to get away with it because I've done well before, it really motivates me to remember that there's no guarantee that history will repeat itself.  It also helps when I'm feeling dejected about my chances of getting into medical school - when I'm being faced by brutally harsh probabilities in the form of applicants : places ratios, it helps to remember that the people I will be competing against are human like me, rather than just numbers of applicants who will inevitably beat me to a place. Sure, the chances are stacked against me mathematically, but every other applicant technically has those chances stacked against them too - nothing is set in stone to the point where others have already been guaranteed a place over me."

Edit: after reading through some of these,  thought of another. I had a football coach that was pretty tough. We would run through fundamental drills, and he would make sure we improved a little each time we tried. He would tell some of us ""Better. Not good, but that's better."" I always appreciated that realistic view that also utilized praise. Very effective."

This is good. I've have chronic health problems that  have been affecting me emotionally. It's been pretty bad so I'm finally opening up to my close friends/family. But so many of them just try to give me medical advice.   I know more than any of them about what I should be doing medically. I don't need advice. I'm so sick of people trying to give me advice. I just need emotional support. I've been pretending my problems don't exist for so long and pretending it doesn't suck and it doesn't affect me socially and emotionally. I need acknowledgement.

"I was this person. Sadly I didn't realize this till very late in life. I was reading Game of Thrones and read this:  *Jon snapped. “They hate me because I’m better than they are.”   “No. They hate you because you act like you’re better than they are. They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he’s a lordling.” The armorer leaned close. “You’re no lordling. Remember that. You’re a Snow, not a Stark. You’re a bastard and a bully.”   “A bully?” Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. “They were the ones who came after me. Four of them.”   “Four that you’ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I’ve watched you fight. It’s not training with you. Put a good edge on your sword, and they’d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave them nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?”   Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn’t he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. “They’re all older than me,” he said defensively.   “Older and bigger and stronger, that’s the truth. I’ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?”   “Ser Rodrik Cassel,” Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him.   Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon’s face. “Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.” His look was grim. “So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?”   “Don’t call me that!” Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. “I never... I didn’t think...”   “Best you start thinking,” Noye warned him.*  And all of a sudden my perspective on life changed. From a young age I was always lucky to have been surrounded by books, education, tutors, and access to resources that would allow someone to learn and grow. When I entered the work place I would shame people for not being smart enough or good enough. But these people didn't have such privileged backgrounds. Some of them are the kids of drug addicts, others were children raised in poor families or the foster care system etc. They didn't have the luxury to learn and grow. Some of them got pregnant young and faced other challenges."
"""It's not your fault.""   When you're treated like shit by your parents when you're a kid, and someone says this to you later on, it's amazing how healing this phrase can be."
"I am a teacher, and I was discussing a student's single mother with my principal. The parent had a reputation for being really high-maintenance and essentially she wanted us to raise her kid for her because she had two other kids at home. This mom had recently put us through the ringer over her daughter's poor report card.  ""I feel badly for her,"" I said to my principal, ""being a single mom and all.""  My principal stopped me dead. ""That was her choice,"" she said in an icy tone. Harsh, yes, as we don't know why this mom was single, but it opened my eyes to a harsh truth about adulthood.   Prior to that, like many young, sympathetic people I used to allow people's life circumstances to be an excuse for their behaviour and states of existence. But that's not the case. Barring significant physical or cognitive impairments, you are expected to take care of your own shit and not be an asshole. Society sets a bar, and if you fail to meet that bar there are very real consequences and very little sympathy. A decade later, I save my sympathy for people who have no say in their circumstances and have very little time for those who made dumbass choices."

People skills and business acumen are great to have in your toolbox for dealing with non-technical stake holders - if enterprise is your preferred career path. The engineers I've worked with that have made the most money (and been most valuable) have always been the people with a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals, and by extension math."

"When I was in Junior High, a friend of mine asked a girl he had a huge crush on to a dance, she said yes, but on the condition that I take her friend and we go as a double date. I was not physically attracted to her friend, but she was a nice girl and I wanted to help my friend go on a date with the girl he liked. My Dad drove all of us to the dance in his 68 Buick Sylark convertible, and we had an awesome time, did some dancing, my friend got an awkward kiss from his date after the dance, and it seemed like my date had a good time, too.   After we had dropped everyone off, and we were driving home, my Dad said he was proud of me for taking that girl to the dance, even though I didn't like her like that, and that he was sure my friend was really thankful I went. I said it was no big deal, and that it was fun.   My dad said:  ""Remember son, beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes to the bone.""   At first I was pissed, because I thought he was making fun of my date's looks, but he explained that even someone who is ugly on the inside can appear beautiful from the outside, but you have to look deeper to see a person's true beauty.   A remarkably insightful statement from my Dad."

It all made me stop feeling guilty for not ""winning the rat race"". It made me feel good with myself as I am. What's more important, it gave me hell lots more of empathy for other people. Because I KNOW we're not unique, we're not so different, we're ALL space monkeys.  And... When things go really south for me, I recall that scene: Tyler drives a car, puts his hands off the wheel and say ""let go!"". I always cry on this scene. It's about true freedom. The whole book and movie was about freedom. When they walk out of the crashed car, this is it. This is how it all ends, you just walk, free.  The movie (I read the book later) changed me a lot. Made me enoy single serving friends more, made me a damn good single serving friend for others.  Oh, BTW, every time I break (or loose) my shiny new thing, I recall ""things you own end up owning you"".  The other thoughts that changed me and made me as I am is all Kurt Vonnegut's prose. All about distance to life, when at the same time you see it clearly in details. It's not you don't care, it's more like you try to really see it. As is. Not to think about it too much. You don't have to understand it. Things happen.  Kurt just observed. Contemplated, sometimes. But there was some ultimate beauty in the mood. The calmness in the middle of the most frightening disaster. The world can end, and you're just admiring the view. The most obvious thing to do when there's nothing else left."

I'm almost completely German by ethnicity and have tried to learn German a number of times, so that I can speak to my parents in it, but it just doesn't work all that well for me. I speak French well enough to hold a conversation and never had trouble learning Spanish (I live in a state where there are quite a few Spanish speakers), but German, for me personally anyways, is far, far more difficult."

Everything is an opinion. I don't apply it to everything because nitpicking everything is just useless. Although I do think this might be an explanation for radical behaviour such as ISIS. They have their own morals and ethics and we shouldn't judge them from our ethics/morals point to explain their behaviour. They aren't sick in their head. Killing for god is the same for them as that we shouldn't kill.  So if it's all the same, and there's no such thing as right or wrong, should we give up the fight against ISIS? Should we set all prisoners free, since according to your view we're in no position to judge their actions?

"Haha, true! I think a lot of native English speakers make more spelling mistakes than people who had to study the vocabulary. Since they already know the word they just write it down by its sound while I had to study the word, it's meaning and spelling.  Silent letters might be especially challenging. Wonder how French primary school kids deal with that. They say and hear ""bo"" but then have to write ""beau"" or ""beaux"".   But grammar is a completely different thing."

Also, a lot of jobs are now automated. Purchasing groceries at the store, purchasing tickets at the movies, etc. but I try to avoid using those.

"Dunno. It seems the people who genuinely feel superior to someone else who speaks broken English are the ones that are typically *really* below average.  I laugh at broken English when it's 1) Adorable, 2) Inventive, or 3) Gives an interesting insight into the mental mechanics of the person's native tongue, or even 4) Points out just how confusing and illogical *my* native language (English) really is.

""Too much! You'll dead!!!"" ...I smile. Friend whispers into her ear...""Ah, You will be die.""   [edit] Reading a comment below brings up No. 5) When visiting another (non-English-speaking) country, someone makes an effort to speak English to me regardless how broken it is. It just tickles when someone is making that kind of an effort to communicate with me in a language they know very little of. There's not much else that comes across as welcoming as that."

"I actually recently learned how negative that attitude is... There's a great TED talk by Carol Dweck on the topic, and I read her book on it as well.   Doing things because we're good at them eventually causes us to seek validation in those things for the things we're good at, and when the going gets tough, causes cheating, despair, lying, and all other kinds of things.

"To some level, that is just being lazy and finding excuses, if you notify your intent to speak a language, people will generally be helpful with that, and won't speak as much English back.  EDIT: doesn't mean this doesn't happen, but its easy to use it as an excuse to not learn as well. They're being helpful by switching to english for someone who doesn't speak their language well. You need to notify your intent if you want them to be helpful in learning the language."

I'm just saying that *if* you have good people/process skills *and* adequate technical skills, you'll always have a good job.   But I stand by the statement that 80% of most ""technology"" problems are actually people/process problems, because what most people think are technology problems (""we need  to build a tool to enable our process"") are really people/process problems (""our business process is utterly broken and makes no sense and bespoke software development is just going to reinforce a broken process that we can barely articulate in the first place and doesn't give us the business outcomes we want"").  If you're actually the person building the programming languages, the compilers, the DB managers, the supercomputing clusters, etc. then I envy you. But most businesses, and most business problems, don't need folks to write B-tree navigation methods and their own sort algorithms.

"There's a quotation that's popularly attributed to Dr. Seuss--[though probably not actually his](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/12/04/those-who-mind/): ""Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.""  I've seen it repeated enough now that it verges on feeling trite, but the first time I ran across it I was 18, living away from home for the first time at college, and really struggling to make friends or even connect with people because of how shy and self-conscious I was.  Thinking about that quote made a huge difference in how confident I felt in myself, and it was really the start of me having some kind of social life."
"Damn this hits too close to home.  I'm a senior applying to colleges right now and my parents and I are puzzled at which school I should choose.  I can either attend a smaller and (slightly) cheaper school with lower entrance standards and be at the top.  Or, I could attend a larger university where I might get lost in the crowd, but have the opportunity to work with some incredibly smart people and have access to a lot of facilities I wouldn't have access to at a smaller school.  They're my parents and want me to shine, of course.  But my argument is that there isn't much of a prize in ""being at the top"" if I can get there without even trying.  Then they see exactly where I'm coming from, but then we start thinking about scholarships and how I could potentially go to school a lot cheaper than I could at a big research university.  This quote is helping me lean towards the bigger schools.  Sure, I may be outclassed, but I'll get a damn good education and have the opportunity to work with some very intelligent people on very cool projects.

It's hard to consciously think about breaking habits you don't think about. At least I'm making progress on it. Once the pattern is broken this shit will be easy.

I have so many of these little seemingly insignificant things that happened during a crucial mental development phase of my life that I remember vividly. A lot of them are important lessons but of course there are always a few embarrassments I'd like to forget about.

"Sarcastically: ""Yeah, 'cause only gay people get AIDS, right?""  Said in the mid-80's, after I mentioned how I thought it would ""...just work itself out like the Black Plague.""  Mind you, I wasn't (knowingly) being homophobic- I was young, uninformed, and didn't really take any time to think about the gravity of the situation.  That, and the medical community was still figuring out how so many people could be carrying/contracting/spreading the disease.    I learned some things about myself that day.  Thank-you soooo much, sheltered upbringing."

I guess I'm saying I don't get the irritation or annoyance levels at all. Honestly I'd rather be tall and get shit for it all the time, because reaching for stuff sucks, but really, people are always going to make jokes about traits that stand out, for the rest of your life, despite how you feel about it. So, I suggest beating them at their own game, playfully dismissing jokes with better ones of your own, and generally chilling out, because it's better than being pissed about it all the time, forever."

"I've been a nurse for awhile now but when I was in nursing school I worked as s secretary on a unit in a hospital. One day there was a code, someone was dying, the first one is ever witnessed. It was hectic, bells ringing, people running, the wife screaming and falling to her knees. I guess I was white as a sheet and wide eyed. The guy made it and then floor supervisor (a large, motherly, gentle woman) walked by and asked if I was ok. I said that I was just a little overcome and she says without missing a beat, ""girl, there ain't nothin' like Savin' a life.""   That one moment stiffened my spine and made me excited to do this job. She's right. It's incredible."

"Totally disagree.  This whole 'soul' thing I've seen over the past couple years is kinda fucked up. It's nice to say ""What good morals he's teaching. That's great, that kid will grow up great."" However, this mentality seems to lead toward ""The smallest poison for the 'soul' is worse than the largest poison for your body"" which is ABSOLUTELY not true. Take a step back and think about this: If you cheat on a test, literally NOTHING goes wrong with you, except you may feel slightly bad. If you smoke, you could KILL YOURSELF. Feeling bad &lt; dying. Obviously this is an exaggeration, but it's inarguable that smoking has the chance to lead to large physical consequences, while cheating leads to small mental consequences. If anything, the problem is that you're not caring for yourself mentally BEFORE via studying or some other mechanism to stimulate your brain so that you don't need to cheat.  Perhaps, cheating on a test could be a 'gateway immoral action' for larger immoral actions. Such as framing someone, lying out of punishment, cheating on a SO, killing someone, etc. There are levels of escalation, and depression is a real thing which can cause or be caused by any of the above, but the simple action of smoking once is much worse **objectively** than cheating once.  Smoking is not only bad for your physical health, but it has a potential of leading to a bad group of friends, weed, slacking off in school, low-wage jobs, other harder drugs, etc. Besides that, it's addictive. Cheating is not addictive - although there is an argument that it leads to more cheating, it's not creating a physical dependency or even a mental one - just a little more work to get out of the hole.  It's time that this was put back in perspective. Caring mentally for yourself is one thing, but physical care takes precedent.   Here's another way to put it: If you're already dead, you can't help your 'soul.'"

I feel like it's Europe's secret awesome travel destination. The people who I met were all just nice and fun and I really enjoyed the vibe. It's funny because it was just a convenient location to rent a car from as we wanted to go to Budapest, but we actually enjoyed Poland way more than Hungary where we were constantly hustled.  And reflecting back when I hitchhike here in Ireland it's Polish people who stop about half the time....haha now I go to Polish grocery stores just to soak some of it up."

"I've actually learned about this in concrete terms - cultures range from being ""low context"" to ""high context"" depending on how direct they tend to be vs. how much you have to infer from the context. So in your example, Poland is a lower context culture than the US. An example of a really high context culture is Japan, where you really have to read social cues. I learned about this in college, but it really hit home after visiting both Argentina and Japan. I felt that Argentina was a lower context culture than I was used to, and it sometimes felt people were being a little too blunt or direct to where it felt somewhat rude, even when I knew they weren't intending to be. Whereas going to Japan, it was the complete opposite - I saw that I could be perceived as rude for the same reasons, and was really self-conscious about trying to pick up on cues and avoid being rude. The difference between the two cultures really helped me understand the concept."

"I used to go to a church camp when I was younger, and they always had great speakers. One year, it was Adrien Despris, and one of the things he said was about the impact you can have on others without knowing. He said, ""Even a shy person will significantly impact 10,000 people in their lifetime.""  I don't know if that number is right, and I'm not even a Christian anymore, but that statement affected the way I think about interacting with people for the rest of my life."
"Also Morgan Freeman but from Lean On Me: ""If you want to kill yourself, jump! If you're going to kill yourself at least have the courtesy to do it expeditiously and stop wasting my time!""   Now I have never been so far down the hole that I've considered suicide and I generally have a poor opinion of it as it only solves one person's problems and creates infinitely more for others, but whenever I go through a period where I'm making bad decisions like drinking too much too often, I think about that and it usually motivates me to get my shit together."

"Genuinely curious, what kind of coffee do you write as an IT tech? The IT guys at my work, while very knowledgeable, basically act as software installers and cubicle setup guys.

I'm never afraid to complain if there's a problem, but the problem isn't always the fault of the person you're working with, or the person that you're complaining to. Make them your ally :-) I'll also say that this advice applies equally well when you're negotiating in a position of weakness. I've lost count of the number of late fees that I've had reversed by opening with ""if I ask you really nicely, do you think we could get this charge taken off?"" They're so used to getting yelled at, that on the odd occasion when they get on the phone with someone who talks to them like a human being, they'll bust their butt to help."

"I've never felt like a person for whom stuff comes naturally... You know those people who just assume they'll be good at something totally new to them because they've never really failed at at anything? Yeah- not me.  Then one day a friend told me this Coolidge quote ""Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race"" and basically told me to crack on. He was absolutely right.  Also I have a quote printed on my office wall ""Never half-ass anything. Always use your full ass."" Which I love."

At 19 I came across and started dating again the boy I had dated in 7th grade (first boyfriend). He told me about how much it had hurt him when he baked cookies from scratch for me and I gave them to all my friends without trying one. I barely remembered that but it was obviously something that had jaded him early on. It forced me to consider how many times I had acted without considering how it might affect others. I changed that.

"In my theology class, we just learned about the Book of Job. In the story, Job's friends cry with him for 7 days and 7 nights while Job voices his pain. This part of the story shows that true friends listen to your pain and feel for you."
"&gt; Why the fuck does anything have to be pointed out?  Because they aren't talking about walking up to some random stranger and going ""Hey you're fat! Lose weight!""  They are talking about friends and family, people they are close to, people they care about.   You're ok with a family member being an alcoholic? Or an addict? Because why should you care? You're only family.   &gt;There is a reason its called THEIR live and not YOUR life.   People don't live in some magical little isolated bubble, they have friend and family that care about them. If you don't have friends or family that care about you chances are no one is really going to point it out anyway.   After college I was no longer in sports and put on weight. I knew it, I could read the scale. But in my mind I always thought ""Its not *that* much"" or ""Its really not *that* bad, I'm fine."" Simply put I was in denial about the reality of it, up until my mom mentions something. Then I hit me it was **that bad.** It took me about 2 years to drop almost 50 pounds. That is why people that care about you say something. They care."
"Don't worry. If 130 baht was the listed price it was probably worth 10. If he isn't haggling in Thailand, she's laughing right back at him on the inside."
"I was a foul mouthed 9th grader, although I kept the cursing amongst friends (not to teachers, parents, etc). Then one day my Social Studies teacher went on a rant because someone in the class cursed.  The line I remember, ""People that curse only do so because they are too ignorant to express themselves in another way.""  For some reason that stuck with me.  Now I am the guy that shocks people a few times a year when I do actually curse. So, while I didn't stop completely, it makes my use of it that much more impactful."
"If everyone's an asshole to you, it's because you're the asshole- CGP Grey"
"Hey just a quick little thing, don't worry about what others think. You're a good person and you know that so be confident in that. Don't apologize for things not worth apologizing for. If you have to think about its not worth it. I used to do the same thing but have slowly been building my confidence back up."
"For example: Stephen Fry is a talented person. I am not.  But Stephen Fry spent his university years doing blow and commiting credit card fraud, whereas I didn't do those things and actually put some work into it, and so I have a better university grade than Stephen Fry. :)  However, in the end he still ends up rich and famous because he is very talented. I forget what point I was trying to make there."

"I learned a hard lesson a few years back. There was a guy who pissed off a development team of 60 people. The CTO asked me to come in and he wanted to know what to do with the guy (a nice guy, but he told everyone that their code sucked). I told the CTO to have him work by himself. He created a programming language to add stuff to his resume. That mistake that I made cost the company probably between $150-200k. If someone can't communicate with people and just pisses others off, then they aren't worth having around. It doesn't matter how good their code is."

"That could be true. Most of the people I reached out to have full lives. I realize that mine is the one that is solitary.  I've learned  a lot about myself while waiting for them to call.  I've realized that I can't rely on other to make me happy.  So, by not sitting around waiting for them to reply to my invites, I am working on making myself happy. Exercising more. Learning to cook, etc   So his statement changed the way I look at what makes me happy."
"Great quote. It's about privilege.  Reddit tends to scoff at the word because it's not understood well. It's not just about race. It's growing up with things you take so completely for granted that you're blind to the fact others don't have them. If you grew up in a first world country, you have privilege.  You're not supposed to feel guilty for having privilege, you're supposed to acknowledge it and let it inform how you treat other people. It's why just about every person who boasts about how they got where they are without handouts or anybody helping them etc. deserves a punch in the fucking mouth. So you drove yourself to first grade when you were 5 years old? You hand-paved the roads the bus drove on and laid every brick in your school yourself? That small loan your dad gave you when you were 20 to start your own business made a much bigger difference than you think. Simply not having to struggle to survive and wonder where your next meal is going to come from at an early age makes a HUGE difference to a person's development and the subsequent trajectory their life takes.  I don't have a lot of things that other people my age in my country have. But I also have/had a lot more than others. If I reach a point in my life where things get a little easier I've promised myself I'm not going to become one of those jackasses who claimed they got where they are without anybody helping them. I had help every step of the way."

"Thank you; that's very kind :)    Well, in a nutshell: I've never had a thing I felt truly passionate about career-wise. I think sometimes people assume I know what I want but I just don't have the self-confidence to work for it (e.g. ""I wish I could be a doctor but I could never make it through med school..."") when in reality I genuinely never knew what career I wanted. For that reason I don't have one yet. At 29, that's obviously a source of some worry to friends &amp; family.  However, instead of listening to me, they all keep trying to woosh me into various things that hold zero interest for me. Last year I quit my job because although I mostly enjoyed it, I had a very abusive boss. I finally walked away in April for my mental health. I spent the summer recuperating at home, and one of my activities was gardening. It was a total revelation to me. FINALLY I found something I actually loved doing from the minutiae to the big picture.  I've been wanting to move back to Ireland where I spent 6 months on sabbatical in 2012 (and where my family is from) and have been trying to map out a long term plan. Open a B&amp;B (one of which I've managed here in Montreal)? Get a job at an existing vegetarian-friendly place (e.g. a restaurant, shop or farm)? Get a well-paying corporate job for a few years? And today after a pretty harsh conversation with my mother, who is also my best friend, I realised the thing I love most is gardening/horticulture and that I can make that a profession if I want.  So simple, so straightforward... I can do training courses there or here, and I can turn that passion into numerous careers. Finally, something I actually see longterm instead of just an interest that dead-ends in a hobby (like cooking or sci-fi).   Horticulture - finally a future on the horizon. I've been struggling with depression and bad coping mechanisms and I finally feel that fresh breeze of possibility again like when I was younger.  Thanks for listening :) It's not exactly a philosophical treatise, just a personal revelation."

Eventually, he saw a piece I wrote somewhere and realized how good I would be as a writer rather than a songwriter. I was a terrible student as a freshman and almost continued on my careless behavior when he sent me a final Facebook message a few days before he died that I wish I responded to sooner.

My father simple said to me ""You never know another persons struggle"".   That stayed with me my whole life and went a long way in making me a compassionate man.   Skip ahead 17 years.... I'm driving down the highway when I get the call from FDNY that my father is dead, I was on my way to pick him up.   I turn around to drive to my mothers house, a hysterical mess, to tell my family that our 53 year old father is dead and I have cars riding my ass, honking and flipping me off...

"Style of the time. Read it aloud, or get someone to read it to you, the way it was originally intended.    Imagine you're gathered in the parlor with the family -- everyone busy with some sort of hand work -- mending, knitting, whittling, cracking nuts or shelling beans -- each taking a turn reading.   The wordiness becomes a launching pad, a springboard for the reader to use to paint a picture, turn up the drama. It also gives the work an overall ""elevated"", educational/improving tone.  Dickens also works MUCH better if read aloud a chapter a week, the way the original serialized novels came out."

"I had a therapist who said, ""You can't expect other people to show up and be different from who they are. "" I had been really angry for two years because my uncle who walked my down the aisle was 45 minutes late to my wedding. To pour salt on the wound, the next morning he asked me, laughing, whether I had been all freaked out. It made me really angry that he would make light of having made me so upset on my wedding day, if I had been upset. (I wasn't upset at the time because my bridesmaid shielded me from finding out, like a true best friend.) But the therapist  helped me see how I had actually set this train in motion by asking someone who has always been an hour late for *everything* to perform the one role in my wedding for which punctuality is crucial.  If you want your late uncle to be a part of your wedding, you have to expect that he will show up late. So invite him to do a toast, for example, and ask a punctual person to walk you down the aisle.  Since then, I've found it so much easier not to get angry with people for being what they're like. I just try to take into account past experiences when coming up with plans."

"My third grade English teacher had brought in brownies her husband  made when a bunch of the kids quickly began saying ""That's weird.""

Out of the 28 students there, at the very least 26 of them were calling him stupid from every side of the room. The kid was so sad he quietly, humbly walked out the classroom with tears in his eyes.   I know my teacher said it with half-confidence and mostly came up with it out of compassion, but after seeing this kid, who only had one friend because no one understood him, walk out as if he didn't want to ever talk again I don't view people as simply ""dumb"" or ""weird.""

"Information and technique cannot be passed on genetically, and ""learning ability"" is 98% your attitude to it, nurture not nature. Although there is definitely is a genetic effect, its not the cause of most peoples intelligence, nor their stupidity. On that aspect, the genetic part of intelligence is still entirely learning ability and not aptitude, so someone with a good education will still demolish less-educated ""naturals"". Using myself as an example, in my last year of my mathematics GCSE a year or two ago, I did pretty average and fell behind what I expected myself to do because I didn't do much work, but as soon as I got interested in maths again my grade shot up. In contrast, when I was interested in French language I picked it up at a reasonable pace, but as soon as I got bored I was barely able to learn anything."

If you don't run the garbage disposal after running dishes that weren't cleared of food debris, the food debris not caught in the trap will clog the garbage disposal and eventually burn it out.

Simultaneously, the guy across the aisle and I look at each other.  We see that we're both rocking out, laugh, and go back to looking out our respective windows.

Anyway, one group was nearly done and their circuit would work sometimes. One of the member of the group kept going off on the other though. He got it to work, then the other guy touched it and it stopped working. He came back and said ""WHY THE HELL DID YOU TOUCH IT? I had it working perfectly!"" Then he wouldn't let the other guy touch the circuit for the rest of the class. Even though he couldn't get it to work.  The whole class was pretty much telling him to shut the fuck up. It was great. I feel sorry for the other guy having to put up with him for the whole semester though."

"And this sort of mentality is my main problem with the social justice movement--they seem to be deliberate isolationists, keeping to their own groups and being inaccessible to others who may otherwise be interested in what they say.  For the most part, what they say really *isn't* that extreme--often it is, but their fundamental beliefs I agree with.  But it's the way they carry themselves that make them seem like they're better than everyone else.  Things like ""check your privilege"" really have valuable meaning behind them, or did originally, but they have become thought-terminating cliches and tend to shut down conversation than to enlighten the conversation.   The concept of privilege is wonderfully mind-opening if you actually try to understand it without anti-feminist bias and without a sort of persecution complex most people put on before reading feminist stuff."

"I think I'm going to need more terms because I can't understand the ones that you use. But it sounds like you think people can physically change their reaction to pain. This is most certainly false. If you mean you can change what you /do/ in response to pain I don't think that's the subject. I need to clarify this before I continue.  Suffering is a bit of a muddled concept and it refers more to general state as opposed to specifically the reaction to pain. It's not too useful here because it's more of a philosophical concept or a description of various pain experiences. It can mean both the direct reaction to pain as well as discontent over a time. I think you're trying to use it as the latter but we're mixing up too many things here. Or, rather, people who like to throw around wise words mixed it up and you're piggybacking without realizing that the terms are not very good.  The mind's reaction to pain is the qualia. This is NOT changeable without some very problematic intervention (brain surgery, mental experience that modifies the brain, gene therapy, morphine). You can't change the fact that pain is unpleasant anymore than you can change the color you see when you look at red. I think that's my problem with this. The reaction you have is the reaction you have. If your brain is wired to have a reaction to pain that makes you uncomfortable you can't do anything about it. Some people's brains are less uncomfortable with various forms of pain. This is also a form of suffering. Suffering is intertwined with pain and can't exist without it. Experiencing the qualia of pain is a form of suffering. So already someone misused some terms but I won't blame them because these are complex concepts and people tend to simplify terms a lot.  Shame, grief, a cut, broken bone, fear, hate, hopelessness, all of these actually cause actual real pain inside your brain. Pain is not ""a bad event"", it's the literal experience of the brain's simulation of the bad event.  My point is, you can't really train people to not care about pain. It just doesn't really work. Exposure to pain actually makes you more sensitive to it and so on. So, no, you cannot do shit about the reaction of the mind to pain. That reaction is part of the suffering. There is an aspect of suffering in reaction to pain that is never avoidable. If you are tortured, you will suffer, full stop. At best you can try some tricks like distractions or thinking about something else but good luck with that. I just wanted to make sure to clarify that because it really sounds like you're one step away from saying: ""Suffering is mind's reaction to pain which can be changed therefore a person can make themselves not feel or not care about the suffering in response to pain"".  ***********  What is actually being said here but is not at all obvious from your post is that one can defer or avoid certain forms of pain. This doesn't really work for physical pain very well at all but it's often very relevant to mental pain. Example: you suffered some embarrassing event in middle school. You can't do anything about that. It happened, you suffered it, the only way to not suffer it would have been to somehow prepare prior to it happening. But that's unrelated to our discussion right now. But, 10 years later, you can still irrationally remember that painful moment. And, it, again, feels like pain. It is pain. And because it is pain, you must feel it, and you suffer from it. But what you can do is perhaps just not remember that event at all or catch yourself as early as possible.  Stoicism also realizes you probably can't do much to handle pain in the moment and mostly deals with mitigation of expectations. It tells you to be ready for the worst and to comply with the worst and tells you not to worry about it.  I.e., what someone incorrectly described as ""don't feel the suffering brought by the pain"" is more accurately described as: ""defer and avoid simulating painful experiences"". You're still stuck with the initial suffering from pain, it is just not that high in some of the examples used or it feels ""right"" because it's directly limited to the event so people don't register it as their definition of suffering.  So the advice is simply: do not simulate and re-simulate painful experiences. Thinking about a loved one you lost, fearing something in the future, regretting something in the past, reenacting a nasty event or trauma, hatred of oneself, etc., all of these are a person's own simulation of pain. And when you feel pain, you suffer, but not because you're choosing to suffer from pain, but because you simulated pain for yourself. The problem with this also is that you can do this a lot and continually so it can have a greater effect on your life than the initial event's pain did. But it would also be a bit unreasonable to say that this is not related to the event: it is.  I agree that this is good advice: we spend too much time ruminating and simulating unpleasant things for ourselves. Stoicism is a philosophy that attempts to attack this by having the person confront all fears immediately and hopefully move past them. Whatever it is, the advice boils down to avoiding forms of thinking that simulate pain because that's the way you're going to avoid those forms of suffering.  I was talking about that earlier. And here's the problem: it's good advice in many cases. Pain simulation is useless a lot more often than it's useful, and generally not a good way to motivate yourself. But it's not at all trivial to force yourself to stop simulating things, and that's where the difficulties I was bringing up earlier come in:  - people who have a more vivid reaction to (physical) and whose brains are not wired to not care about it will have a lot more trouble not caring about painful experiences in the future and are more likely to simulate bad future experiences and create that simulated suffering for themselves. Stoicism doesn't work for these people very well, see xkcd below. So at best these people may hope they will never experience the pain that they fear and at that point we're counting probabilities. But suffice to say that some people hate pain a lot more than others, and complying with a future with that much pain in it is not OK with them; - on the other end, people who have chronic pain will have trouble not caring about it because it comes so often and they become so used to it that their brain chemistry is stuck on the painful experience and is screaming at them to make it stop, simulating it more to enable them to do just that. We didn't evolve to happily endure pain and forget about it the moment it stops; - pain may be bottled but may resurface. If you close yourself up on to some event it still gets put in a box somewhere and may come back in force later. That's why sometimes grief needs to be experienced and cannot simply be ignored; - people with depression essentially have brains that really like to simulate pain all the time depending on the type of depression. And since this is a chemical disbalance good luck deferring that pain - you have very limited control over it and you have to very careful with it, and the fact that you're already in pain makes that that much more difficult, because pain in itself occupies your brain preventing it from doing other things; - PTSD: this is essentially defined by inability to stop re-simulating things to the point that your brain does it for you in nightmares without your input.  TLDR: you really can't control your mind's reaction to things unless you're already pretty damn mentally resilient for other reasons. We cannot block senses. You have some control over *pain simulation* in your brain so you can try to reduce how much suffering you generate yourself vs direct experiences, assuming you're not already significantly mentally ill. So this advice is useful to people who are at the edge of being able to handle things and are closer to a re-simulation loop but can stop it. Kind of like preventative medicine for the brain (I'd go for ketamine, personally). My problem is that the reactions in this thread are dangerously close with using the word ""choose"" to implying that everyone can just choose to avoid all the suffering that comes with pain. No, you can't, you can choose to attempt to understand pain triggers (while we make fun of trigger warnings) and engineer a way to prevent them in the future, but that is not a simple endevour and there are many processes in the brain that work hard to prevent you from doing just that. If we could do it so easily we would have died out long ago because everyone would just stop caring about bad experiences and nobody would try to change anything (funny side effect of stoicism, btw). It's an evolutionary adaptation. Simplifying it to just ""choose"" is insulting and wrong.  &gt; Julia gave a great example of this.  Julia is a poor example of this. The initial situation was unavoidable. The next 2 years were pretty unavoidable, too, and just show the lasting secondary damage of the initial set of events. We don't know how they recovered. People don't recover from depression very easily at all. That's the problem with stoicism: it most probably auto-selects people with stress-resilient brains then tells everybody that they should do the same while it may not work for anyone except those with stress-resilient brains (and [people without a good imagination](https://xkcd.com/883/)). Chicken and egg problem: does stoicism just work or are the people for whom it works already resilient and can deal with imagining worse outcomes so it's a natural philosophy for them?"
"Can you ask your peers for review? Like, especially if you're working on something they've previously worked on. It helps you out, also it shows respect, gets people used to the idea that they're working on a team, lets them know when something they wrote was buggy (don't point it out, obviously, but if they see it in the diff they can internalize the feedback), and if you do it maybe other people will start feeling like it's a normal thing to do as well."

"Finishing assignments quickly doesn't make you intelligent. I was the opposite of you in school: Afflicted by ADHD, I would procrastinate on in-class assignments. I could easily just do it, but instead, I would just sit there and watch everyone else, watch the clock tick, listen to every single pencil move one by one, spy on the teacher, etc. Eventually, there's no more distractions to observe, so I turned inwards, and then comes the guilt of having no motivation, the realization that I'm the only kid that doesn't give a fuck for some reason. Then, ""fuck that, I *do* have fucks to give"". . .And that's the process that I go through to begin tasks, even ten years later as an adult. I get shit done, competently, but to hell if I don't waste time having an existential crisis first. It's funny, people like you still get frustrated with people like me, even in adulthood."

Another 49.5% had grim determination and only about 0.5% normal human beings. Imagine a high school without teenage love, drama, extra curricular or anything remotely interesting.

My dad was nearby working on the car and must have heard all of it, because after my friend went home he came over and told me:   ""I heard you talking about Steve. Today he had a responsibility and he went to work and he was making money while you two were goofing off all afternoon. As crappy as his job may be he's doing more with his life and closer to becoming an adult than either of you two. I don't ever want to hear you making fun of anyone for what work they do, because they are trying to make an honest living and no matter how they do it, that is respectable."" (It was 20 years ago, so I'm sure the wording isn't exact, but it captures the tone of the conversation.)   Since that day, I've had plenty of shitty jobs myself and even though I'm in a good position now, I will never look down on anyone because of their career."

"Well, I don't have any research to back me up on this, but we weren't exposed to as many non-professional writing ten years ago, and *especially* not so twenty years ago.  In the past, when we read something, it was probably written by someone who went to college to learn how to write, or whose job it is to write for the public, and was checked over by editors.  That, and close family members, friends, coworkers notes to each other.  Nowadays, so much of what we read is from social media, which has little oversight and is often written by people without too much formal training.  I'm guessing the error may even occur *less* now than it did in the past."

"I've found that it's of some help to think of one's moods and feelings about the world as being similar to weather:  Here are some obvious things about the weather:  It's real. You can't change it by wishing it away.  If it's dark and rainy it really is dark and rainy and you can't alter it.  It might be dark and rainy for two weeks in a row.  BUT  It will be sunny one day. It isn't under one's control as to when the sun comes out, but come out it will.  One day.  It really is the same with one's moods, I think. The wrong approach is to believe that they are illusions. They are real. Depression, anxiety, listlessness - these are as real as the weather - AND EQUALLY NOT UNDER ONE'S CONTROL. Not one's fault.   BUT   They will pass: they really will.  In the same way that one has to accept the weather, so one has to accept how one feels about life sometimes. ""Today's a crap day,"" is a perfectly realistic approach. It's all about finding a kind of mental umbrella. ""Hey-ho, it's raining inside: it isn't my fault and there's nothing I can do about it, but sit it out.

"Hanlon's Razor works because actual meanness or cruelty is obvious. It takes effort. The problem is many folks — way more than the amount of cruel people — expect ridicule or outright malice, to the point where they can find it wherever they look. But we don't usually *intend* to offend or upset anyone, so if you are upset over something someone said ... but it doesn't seem obvious that that was their intention, you will usually be right to assume they're just fumbling their words/having a moment of stupid/acting out of ignorance."
"When i was a kid, I was proportionally bigger than the other kids at my age. Taking advantage of my size I picked up kids smaller than me, bully or make fun of them. One day I made a kid cry so hard at the playground. A girl, also the same of my age that time, defended the kid and approached and told me ""If someone did that to you, are you going to be happy?""  Those words knock me. I stopped bullying. I regretted doing it. I grew up up to this now that every decision I make I ask myself the same question. I think every bully should hear those words."

"It could have a lot to do with cultcure if a culture emphasizes success over enjoyment. (or really anything they stress that takes priority over what another culture stresses)  many interests in which you fail at initially could grow to be something you'r passionate about once you get better at it, and learn things that give it a sense of mastery.     on the other hand, a culture where ""follow your heart"" is the main goal, you might dismiss things you initially fail at.    I find that many (most?) activities are completely different when you delve deep into them and learn far beyond what somebody who only tries it once.   I inititialy enjoyed drawing/painting because ""I was good at it"", compard to other kids my age, but as i grew up the things that keep me hooked are things like understanding materials, light, and anatomy.  the more I learn about how things are in real life, the more joy I have when creating/designing.  drawing or painting is the tool, it doesn't really matter which tool you use, its about the product you create.  When I was a kid. I just enjoyed hammering shit(metaphorically speaking), but as I grew up, I devoloped a love for creating stuff, and the tool didn't really matter."

At some point though I thought to myself:  ""I don't really care about any of these people.""    It's a bit cynical but I realized that most people probably don't care about me as well.

When I feel insecure in those little moments that feelings punctuate in conversation and don't know what to say, I'll often throw out the ""I really appreciate that ___"" form of a statement instead of the ""I apologize for ___"". Puts a positive spin on the entire interaction, allows for a verbal assertion that the other party has done you a favor that you'd like to reciprocate, and generally reinforces that you're aware of the conversation from the other party's point of view and that if they give you generosity it won't go unnoticed.

The past year I have been working on becoming a better person. I've gone through strange stages of my life of flip-flopping but after this was said to me last year I had to stop and think. I've made so many mistakes and have hurt so many people. I'm not in the greatest position right now but I'm doing every thing I can to brighten someone's day.   Some people have bad days, and they can be rude but they aren't bad people. When someone is rude or nasty with me now I just kind of sit back quietly and wonder What's going on their lives.   Anyways, I'm trying to work on myself every day. It's really difficult and I'm tired of being such a shitty person. The worst things I've done were to girls I dated in high school and college - lying to get what I want, non appreciative, and looking at them like they're an arm piece and not the beautiful, smart, girl I'm with. They won't ever forgive me, and I don't blame them. I'm kind of with a girl now that I've known for about 11 years... Half my life. She doesn't know everything to the full extent, but so far I've been honest and real with her and she's beautiful, smart, fun, with a good head on her shoulders, and comes from a family who loves her more than life itself. She's special.    I wish I could leave my past completely and put it out of memory, but I can't and I have to live with the terrible things I've done.   I've ways wanted to help people, but there's no helping anyone when you're a shitty person. Being kind to people (but not capable of being taken advantage of; there are lines) is difficult a lot of times. Being an asshole to people might seem easy to do, but none of it is worth it. Words hurt so much to the extent of psychological damage.   My uncle and my best friend (and his family) are the nicest people I've ever met in my life. I want to change and be the men they are. It will take time though - baby steps."

Next year, you'll wish you had started today.   3. I was 13 years old, trying to teach my 6 year old sister how to dive into a swimming pool from the side of the pool. It was taking quite a while as my sister was really nervous about it. We were at a big, public pool, and nearby there was a woman, about 75 years old, slowly swimming laps. Occasionally she would stop and watch us. Finally she swam over to us just when I was really putting the pressure on, trying to get my sister to try the dive, and my sister was shouting, ""but I'm afraid!! I'm so afraid!!"" The old woman looked at my sister, raised her fist defiantly in the air and said, ""So be afraid! And then do it anyway!"" That was 35 years ago and I have never forgotten it. It was a revelation -- it's not about being unafraid. It's about being afraid and doing it anyway.  4. ""You know you're an adult when you can be right without proving the other person wrong.""  5.

"When I was in college this ""'motivational"" type speaker came right before the new year started to give pep talks to the student-dorm staff.   During his talk he mentioned people who were always complaining they were bored and people who, if you asked how they were, always responded with ""I'm bored"".  His response to these types of people is that they aren't bored with the world. There's plenty of stuff to do. The problem wasn't everything else, the problem was them. If you're bored, it's because you are a boring person.   That was in 2006. I haven't said ""I'm bored"" ever since and I often repeat this story with my students when they complain about being bored."

They let us make mistakes, get hurt, and even when we got older get arrested. But, they also let us deal with the consequences of what we did and work for what we had."

"The first few days after my older daughter was born, my (then) husband, the baby and I stayed at my folks' house so they could help us all get adjusted to everything. The day we were supposed to go back to our house, my mom and my husband got the car packed with everything, and I sat on the front porch swing with my baby and my dad.  I was very nervous and scared- I couldn't believe they were letting me take this tiny being home - how was I going to get everything done?  My dad realized this and said, ""what's the first thing you have to do when you get home?"" I said, ""make the baby up some bottles"" and then he said, ""and after that?"" and I said, ""get her diapers washed and dried."" He looked at me and said, ""don't think about anything other than those two things. when you get them done, think about the next thing- just take it one thing at a time and it won't be so overwhelming."" That's some of the best advice I've ever gotten- I've used it many times when I start to feel overwhelmed about all the things I think I need to handle - just looking at the ""next thing"" has saved my sanity."
"Like I said, they probably used to do it for almost anyone, but as far as I know, they need permission from family or something. My friends said it's pretty routine regardless, and I imagine it's along the same lines as praying for someone. ""Please God, help this dude get to heaven."" Like, again, if God exists and is answering your prayer, dude saved. If God doesn't exists or ignores your religion, absolutely nothing happens.   The argument I've heard was that God would punish the dead guy for being associated with a bad religion. Which is a silly belief if that's true. Death, as far as any religion I've ever heard (apart from apparently the Mormon church) is basically it and if you weren't saved yet, sucks to be you. So, he;s dead and it's over. Plus, what kind of a shitty God would punish you after you're already in heaven for something someone else did to you after you were already in heaven? *Hey man, thanks for stopping by, but your neighbor on earth, that mormon chump, he prayed you out of here and into hell. See ya!*"

Me being a typical 18 year old just thought in my head, god dam my dads nuts. Then later that night after dinner i walk into the kitchen and see him washing the dishes to which i asked him again do you want some help? and again he replied ""no, im enjoying it!"" Took me a week and a tab of acid before i realised my dad gave me the secret ingredient to enjoying life, which was to just enjoy every little part boring/menial/disgusting task. to just enjoy it! This was over 5 years ago and i can safely say i'm a much happier person because of those few words he said."

"You are not female.   If you were female, and 5'8' and 135 pounds, someone would be along shortly to tell you what a fat cunt you are.   There really are significant differences in how the genders behave and are treated about body size and shape. There is no such fucking thing as a girl who doesn't know she's fat. There are women who are trying to downplay the negativity around being fat, but, barring mental illness, if you're a fat chick, everyfuckingbody lets you know in myriad ways every goddamn day that you don't deserve to take up that much space or eat that much food or be visible in public. Never wonder why they're trying to downplay the negativity.   If you're reading this thread and thinking about helpfully informing a fat female friend about how fat they are, please do anything whatsoever else with your time.

"Super late to the thread but replying anyway cuz this hit me. A while back I was on the train home and was sitting opposite this very talkative, slightly intoxicated New Zealander and after a bit, we started chatting. I mostly listened, but it was a really nice way to spend the 20 minute journey. When we both got off at our stop, I jokingly said ""so uh. have a good life I guess"" and he smiled and said likewise.   A few months later, I'm sitting in the same type of train, in the same place, and this dude with a beard sits opposite me. He's oddly talkative and has a bit of an accent. Sure enough we both realise we've met before after a few minutes and shoot the shit again. We talked about life since our last encounter and he mentions that he'll be going back home in December (it was about August/September) so when we finally parted ways at our station again I said the same thing as last time, he said it back, we smiled and parted ways. I never saw him again, and being that it's January noemi doubt I ever will but I still think of him from time to time. He was pretty cool."

"This is a very simple and limited example. Nobody is going to go into a spiraling depression if they're dumped unless they're *already in a bad state*, so at that point we're discussing the preexisting bad state. A person ruminating a bit over getting dumped is actually pretty normal. If that's the worst thing a person experienced we can pack our bags and move on.  Let's take some more realistic examples:  - you got a new job and after a few months you realize you hate it. It's continually making you miserable. What's going to be more effective: changing your attitude or quitting your job? - you're gay and society hates you if they find out you're gay. How much attitude change is it going to take for you to convince yourself that being a complete social outcast hiding from everyone is something you should just deal with? Or should you go campaign for your rights? What's more likely to work for your mind? - you went to Iraq and over the course of a year watched your entire unit die, some of them in really grisly ways. You go back home. You now have PTSD and you keep feeling guilty about the one surviving guy in his unit. Even when you don't feel bad and you try to forget about it, you keep getting recurring nightmares. What would have been more useful here: said event not happening, or changing your attitude?  &gt; You probably aren't gonna be un-dumped  You're not going to be un-raped, either, that doesn't make the trauma go away. Getting dumped is not an event worth avoiding but many are. Assuming all events are unavoidable is even worse than acting defeated when they happen. You're avoiding the true comparison (change/elimination of circumstance vs experience of circumstance) by pretending the circumstance will always happen even though it's not true, and assuming every person can handle every circumstance. Most people agree that the proper approach to the rape situation is to prevent rapes rather than to train victims to be super resilient. There may be some usefulness to training victims but you're still rolling dice. It's better to just prevent rapes.  Changing circumstances all around is much more reliable, useful, and efficient than changing attitude. It's how we ended slavery, got worker rights, founded better communities and government systems, got rid of religious domination, healed diseases. Do you want to live in a shitty world that you're continually trying to accept with your brain that's wired to hate to accept things, or do you want to live in a world that's a good enough place that you do not need to do that?"

"I think many people here are confusing talent with physical ability. Of course taller people have a greater physical capacity for dunking basketballs. The goal is closer to them. That's not talent. Talent is being able to see the opportunity to get close enough to dunk. Skill is having practiced dribbling enough to take advantage of that opening.  It's really hard to differentiate between talent and skill, as people who are good at things make them look easy. But there is one thing that separates the truly fantastically great from the only very very good, and that is tons and tons of practice.  That's not saying that everyone could be the greatest at any given thing ever, but with dedication and practice you could be the best at something. Even if it is cup stacking."

"Not the same logic. Fat is not attractive.

Sure I was vindicated, but I had also alienated those people. I eventually realized that I held all my person value in being that super-informed guy that was always right, and didn't think I had anything to offer others otherwise.

"""They are paying us the same rate to pack up these boxes as they were to analyze that data."" A gentlemen who later became my mentor said that to me on one if my first jobs post-college. It stuck with me. If you are getting paid well, don't complain about the work, be appreciative of your pay and job, and do it well (within reason.) This was a contract gig, mind you, and the whiners got let go earlier, versus those of us who happily did a variety of tasks. Pay was great, too."

"Almost 20 years ago I met Kate Barnes, who was at the time the poet laureate of Maine. I mentioned that it was a shame that poetry wasn't more popular. She replied, ""I don't know. Some things do better in the shade."" I still think about that."
"That is awesome. Which is why I loved The Martian movie. The NASA director says that saving Matt Damon's life is nothing compared to what else that money could be used for. Then the British guy (I forget his name) says, ""No it's not. Saving his life is just as important."""

"I was told years ago that all emotional reactions are coming from one of two places... Either love or fear. This helped me to examine my feelings in confusing situations. Was I scared, angry, critical? Then what am I fearful about? Am i really trying to come from a place of love? Then my actions should reflect that. Seeing life through such common denominators really makes things easier."

"Why does every person who dealt with depression feel the need to act as if that means they understand everyone else's? That's not how it works. Depression has a lot of variety. At least don't tell those friends of yours they're just doing it to themselves.  You know how many things become unavoidable if someone else intervenes? Yet we're all taught to fix everything individually and alone. And if we didn't fix it alone we just ""wanted"" or ""chose"" it. I am all for telling people to help each other out. I think it works a lot better than trying to raise every person to be a stoicist. But the implication here is not to seek social connection but to control one's own head. Not to seek companionship and discuss with others.  Sometimes is the key point. Sometimes, yes, sometimes, not. And sometimes the divide between who's causing what and how much they control it is murky. Telling people they are prolonging their own depression is a bad idea. There's an element of that but it's also there because the brain wants it, or because pain is better than nothing.  If it's avoidable if the individual just stops prolonging it why do they prolong it? Does it come back anyway? Looks like for you it didn't, for some it just keeps coming back anyway.  Depression largely doesn't respond to simple advice very well and I don't like people using their anecdotal example to say that everyone else who has a self-destructive loop is just wanting it or something and they could easily just stop. A lot of depression feeds on self-hatred, that's essentially feeling bad on purpose, that doesn't mean the person can easily fix it. Most people also don't pull out on their own. Depressions can last for 10 years. It's easier for some people than others, we don't know why. You recovered and that's your own thing. It's good when people recover and I think many people can. But not all can and some have much more complicated depressions (among other things, we're only starting to talk about situational depression). Don't talk about others as if they are all just causing their depression just because they have a loop of making themselves sadder and because it was relatively easy for you to get out. It's not that simple and they themselves may not even know what's going on in their head."

"I will *never* forget this.  When I was probably 4 or 5 years old, me and my friend Jake were on the swing set at school. We were talking about.. something (okay guess I forgot THAT detail) and he said ""something something something THREE something something.""   Except when Jake said THREE, he pronounced it incorrectly, like this: ""FREE."" I thought I'd be helpful, and told him ""You know, you say it like THREE not FREE.""  He said, ""I know but I can say it however I want.""  I'd never encountered such random DEFIANCE in my young life. It taught me that not everything had to be in a rigid frame of ""what's right"" and ""what's wrong."" Changed my POV forever, and I've never forgotten that moment. (I'm 29 now.)  Thanks Jake!"

"It's not the opposite at all!  When Bruce Lee says he fears the man who has practiced one kick many times, he implies that it is because he that that man has made every possible mistake doing that one kick, and fixed them. He has perfected that one kick.  The old novice equivalent of Bruce Lee's kicking man is a man who has performed the same kick many times, but every time with poor form. That man has not perfected the kick at all. In fact, he has probably ingrained his mistakes and makes the same ones every time."

"There is a lot of merit to this coming from my personal experience of life. All throughout high school and middle school I thought I was an idiot. It wasn't until after I graduated college that I made the realization that I am only an idiot in comparison to these brilliant minds. Most of my classmates are remarkably successful! A good portion today are doctors, engineers, financial analysts, or (oddly a majority) geologists. I found out second hand that one of my classmates kids went trick-or-treating with Obama's kids for goodness sake.  It is hard to see the redwood forest when you are in fact just an average sized oak tree."

"I have twins, a 1 year old, a 3 year old and a 9 year old.

No one will need you to change their diaper or get them milk. Enjoy your messy house.""  I still tear up when I think of any empty house and my twins are 3 months old."
"She said, ""I feel like I'd be settling for you."" I was 13 and we were really into each other for over  year and I finally asked her to be my girlfriend.

"New Brunswicker here. Don't even get me started on our government's approach to language education. We are the only officially bilingual province in Canada, and they literally cut our French immersion programs less than a decade ago. Now you cannot put your child in immersion until, I believe, the fifth grade. Makes tonnes on sense considering we learn a second language best when we are as young as possible...  I took ""core"" French (that is, French for Anglo kids who aren't in immersion) and had no idea how to even conjugate a verb when I graduated from high school in 2003. I eventually learned the language in college by doing a late (really, really late) immersion program.  If we want to enforce bilingualism in this country, we have to invest in language education. If we can put in place requirements for high school graduates in math, science, and reading/writing, why can't we extend this to their second language too?"
We are the sum of our experiences.

"You have a collect call from ""Pearl harbor"", will you accept the charges?"
"""That's when I truly knew you cared.""   I was nearly thirty and had never had a girlfriend longer than four months, from trauma and trust and mental issues. And then this girl came back from my past, with whom I'd fallen in love when I was a kid, and admitted part of her had never stopped loving me for the last two decades, the same way I loved her. We finally stopped talking because we felt too much, which isn't good when one person is in a relationship. And when she said we had to stop, I just said, ""Okay."" (That's what she was referring to."") Because I'd never wanted to someone to stay in my life so badly, and I'd never been so willing to let someone leave.  I believed I was ugly and God didn't exist. But the most beautiful person I've ever met wouldn't have fallen in love with me if I were truly ugly, and it's hard to believe she was created by accident.  But even if it were an accident, it's even more amazing. That in the complete chaos of life, the countless coincidences, somehow we met and fell in love, and then 18 years later, we felt the same way we did as children.   It made me realize some people don't forget you. Can't forget you. They let you in as deeply as you you let them in. Even if they leave and never speak to you again, you may have changed them for the better, in a profound and everlasting way."

The only time I put any twisty turny bullshit in is when I worry that someone may say yes to something for any reason that is not because they want to."

"When I was 28 I was so infuriated with my girlfriend because even though I loved her she was clumsy and always budding her nose in my family affairs or work and just making situations worse. It came to the point where half my family shunned me for being with her. I would fight with her constantly and it pained me because she would cry and apologize and would say she was only sticking up for me or speaking out what I only would say under my breath but should've said. Then one day I spoke to my sister who was very fond of my girlfriend and she told me ""don't judge people on their actions but only judge on their intentions. "" and I realized that this whole time she was only being my sword while I was a spineless punk the hid my thoughts. And we've been happily married 6 years."
"In college, I attended a seminar. They started telling a story (for the life of me, I can't remember what it was. All I remember was it was ridiculous). At the end of the story, the lady telling the story said ""I made all of that up. Remember to think critically about everything."" I was always kind of a gullible kid, and I would take a lot of things at face value. That seminar, and watching Cops, has helped me with not believing everything that people say to me."
"I was once called ""homophobic"" after I told someone about how I thought about gay culture because of how i was shaped to understand it in grade school and Christian family stuff.   It made me stop and rethink how I was taught; now I question everything I am told,  I research things and form my own opinions now because of this one incident.  At first I was upset because I was called something I didn't understand, now I have grown to think that labeling people is wrong and just ignorant.  I would say my way of thinking had changed because of that one instance."

"I don't remember who told me this but it was someone I deemed close at the time. He was born by unconventional means and he always felt out of place.

Truely powerful."
"When I was younger, I was a smart aleck. I was studious, and I often made fun of people for not knowing something. I also rarely bothered to listen to what people had to say, since I thought I knew everything there was to know.  My mother immediately shut me down. She told me to stop claiming that I knew everything, since there were people that were going to know much more than me in lots of other fields. Also, if I would just shut up and listened to what other people had to say, I might learn something new.  Those words really left a lasting impression on me. Nowadays, I often help others when they're new to something in my expertise, I ask questions when I don't understand something, and I always try to be mindful of what other people have to say."

I can also choose to remember the good times and let that influence my character moving forward."
"I already answered elsewhere in this thread with a different thing, but another one popped out of my memory just now.    I struggled my whole life with getting respect.  I was super respectful of people, always willing to help in any way I could, and always willing to share all the knowledge that I had, and always willing to go far out of my way to help even strangers.    My problem was that people treated me like shit.  A small slice of people were quite nice to me, and what's amazing is we could usually spot each other very quickly when we entered the same circles.  So not everybody treated me like shit.  But over all I didn't have much respect.  I'd get passed over for invites to parties, my opinions even when well-informed would fall flat on deaf ears, I would usually enter a particular social structure and then slowly see my connections evaporate over time.    One time a very smart guy was sitting on a couch and watched me get sort of squeezed out of a conversation, and shat on a little bit with people making snarky insults at me and everything, and then the room cleared leaving me and him sitting there.    He said to me very simply:  **""Did you know the optimal solution for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat?""**    That's all he had to say.  It resonated, and sort of crystallized my mind, answering tons of questions at many levels.    I began to experiment with this idea, ""tit-for-tat"".  If someone smiled at me, I smiled back.  If someone make a sarcastic remark about me, I immediately followed with a sarcastic remark about them.  If someone was just neutral, I'd be sorta just neutral.    For the first time in my life, a small spark of two-way respect entered my social interactions.    I believe that most people know this instinctively.  They probably pick up this idea at age like 10 and then by age 15 they have learned to make it pretty much automatic.    For me it was awkward and rough at first, but even in its roughest, most awkward form my using tit-for-tat with people began to produce better relationships.  It did not produce bitterness.  In fact it cleared up a bunch of bitterness - in me.  My never standing up for myself - especially on that micro-scale of sentence-to-sentence - led to me almost continuously building up a pool of resentment which would burst forth as ridiculous tantrum like behavior.  That stopped happening.    It did not take long before the concept had become automatic for me.  Once again, I can focus on positivity.  In fact, I've found that all I need to do in response to a social bully is simply ever-so-slightly turn down the positivity that I beam toward them, and that is enough to signal to them that *I am aware of how this works*.    Now when someone persists in trying to be nasty with me (and this is exceedingly rare) I just chuckle because it is obvious to me that it's out of their control.    This is one of those single sentences which, when delivered at the perfect moment in the perfect wording, changed my way of thinking forever.    If you're reading this, you may even remember this moment yourself.  Thank you.  Please don't dox me :)"

"This is a thread about changing your way of thinking. Both statements are equally (un)true. Some people feel that they would be happier if they did more things. Unfortunately humans are, fundamentally, irrational. We don't make most of our decisions based on logic. (Heck, a lot of modern neuroscientists are drifting into the Liebnizian camp of thinking we don't actually *make* most of the decisions we think we make at all.) But we still attempt to guide our lives using reason. By concentrating on one of those two questions instead of the other, we can change our thoughts and behavior. And perhaps one of those two courses of behavior is preferable to the other, for reasons which are not, actually, encapsulated in those questions."

I don't really see how it's different in work. One can definitely feel devalued at work and that's the core issue here. And having someone to push you forward is a good thing in school.  I think the caution here is to be careful with really challenging institutions or work places where you may be unable to handle the pressure for whatever reason. There's no point being pushed by people if your confidence is so low you stop improving.

"I was a failure at math and in college I was again failing a beginning algebra class when this other professor who taught sociology opened my eyes when we were talking about my struggle in math. He said it so simply I wondered why no one had ever pointed it out to me before. He said all I had to know was the recipe and that the only thing that changed was the numbers. Once I understood and followed the recipe the rest would be easy. He was right. I began to look at math completely different and passed all math classes with A's after that....trig, geometry, algebra, calculus, etc. It was a defining moment. I ended up loving mathematics."

"I work from home on the computer except for rare occasions between 4 and 8 times per month. I don't go to the gym or go out. I spend almost all day watching TV and sitting on the computer.   My boyfriend switches up breakfast a bit every day but it's usually two or three eggs, two pieces of toast, a bagel, or two toaster strudels, a bowl of oatmeal or grits, a sausage and either ham or bacon. Lunch is random, usually whatever pasta we have with some jar of cheese sauce and whatever meat we have mixed in. Dinner is the same.  We keep lots of frozen and canned foods for snacks throughout the day, usually like 2 or 3 between meals. Snacks are like vienna sausages, a bowl of ramen, some frozen fish sticks or meatballs or chicken nuggets, cookies or crackers or whatever canned veggies we have around.  He's a bit more active than me, but not by a super amount. He takes our dog out 4 or 5 times a day. He's built like the rest of his family. They vary in height but are CRAZY skinny. I can put my hand around his ankles no problem. He's 5'8.   We've been eating lots and living the same lifestyle for two years, but I'm still built like my family, with a tiny belly and big butt and thighs, and he's still built like his, tiny and boney all over, why wouldn't we change to be more like each other?   Also if metabolism can't affect anything, why do people often get bigger as they get older in some families? This happens on my mom's side of the family but not on my dad's side, even with the families branching off, eating differently, not even living in the same states. I was always taught that that was because metabolism slows down as well.  I'm just very confused. I have bigger friends than me who eat way less and exercise way more, but they tend to come from big families as well."

"&gt;“The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return, and we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” ― Carl Sagan, Cosmos"

"I think that's part of it, but in another place Gladwell mentions that a lot of accolades tend to go to people who are performing at the top, regardless of relative to what that top is. I.e., you're more likely to get a nice scholarship or fellowship being from the top of your institution than being in the middle of a more elite institution.  Work can be kind of similar. You may need to appear to be one of the best to actually get a raise or a promotion. + there's the happiness factor, if you put a lot of work into your skill level but it's not seen as valuable because everyone else is doing the same that may have really nasty psychological effects. That's probably why the effect gets worse the higher up you go instead of being just constant. People don't care about being bad if they didn't really try, but it really sucks to be ""bad"" when you gave it what seems like your all. It doesn't help when people above you are often all the geniuses, who may even think you're just lazy.  It's a bit of a weird tradeoff between skill and happiness, almost. The problem seems to be that we just don't value absolute performance as much as we tend to value relative performance in any group of peers. An above average person at an elite institution shouldn't be feeling like crap, nor should an above average performer working on really challenging things."

Shouldn't this car have a roof? -Abraham Lincoln
"It was a few simple words but had a profound impact on how I view myself and how I treat myself.  Last year, a guy called me a man hater.  I took it to heart and I stepped back and looked at myself, my behavior, my interactions, and how I treated the men in my life, past and present.  He didn't elaborate on his view and I can take a good guess at why but I frankly don't care - if he didn't intend to cause harm or felt he had misjudged he would have apologized. When he said it, I found myself doing what I did in my marriage - trying to analyze all my failings and fix ""me"" because someone made me feel inadequate, because someone made me feel I was lacking in providing for their happiness/satisfaction.  I didn't spend a second focusing on what I needed, how I felt, if I was happy - I was trying to fix whatever shortcomings might be there that caused this man to have that view. I came to realize I hadn't released myself from the negative patterns of my past.  If I am viewed as man hater for respecting myself, loving myself, and making my feelings matter, then so be it.  A man who can't respect that doesn't deserve me in his life and that doesn't make me a man-hater, it means I love myself enough to know I deserve better."

"Mate, y'know all those voices in your head that say awful things like ""you're a loser"" or ""everyone hangs out with you out of obligation"" or ""you can't do anything right""?  Only you can hear those voices. No one is actually thinking that. In the real world, people who don't like you just don't talk to you. Or are assholes about it. But no one pretends to like anyone; that would be stupid. If you have any friends, they're real, and they love you. Even if sometimes it feels like they don't, they do. And if they love you, they must have a reason. You're a lovable person. Cheer up."
"Maybe it doesn't get you high. I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine, so I'm often less functional after drinking a cup of coffee than I am after smoking a bowl. And I hear people speak of a ""caffeine high"" often. I suppose it depends on your definition of ""high""."

"I feel you. Just the other day one of my coworkers floored me with this gem. ""You know some of us actually like having you around."" Made me stop and think about it really. I always just assumed no one even noticed what I did all day and that I probably came off as an asshole. That dude has been in my shoes and I honestly never thought about it. At the time I looked at him bewildered and asked why and later on another friend said a very similar thing. I realize this is insane for most people to not understand but literally no one has ever told me up until the past few days that they actually cared about me and what happens to me. It was a big deal. I'm still not afraid to die, but now at least I know I'll be missed by at least two people."

Conversation is hard because I'm afraid of making a complete fool of myself. I feel that this has helped a lot.

"Years ago I was in a laundromat and there was Reader's Digest. Never liked the magazine, but doing laundry is pretty boring. But you takes good advice where you finds it, I learned. Anyways, inside the magazine was a quote. Someone once asked the novelist Henry James what was the secret for a good life. He replied, ""Three things.

Saw this on Reddit four years ago when I was applying to colleges. Came down to two schools I was interested in and I applied this quote to my decision. Never looked back since.
"Okay so on the complete opposite spectrum, I was on a business trip in India and bussed my own trays and a coworker (who lived there) stopped me. He said, ""you are taking a job away from someone. Your time is worth more than theirs, use it more efficiently than bussing trays"".   It really made me think. I get paid 20x more than them...is it actually more efficient for the world if I optimize my own time and not clean up after myself?"
"Wow, that's incredible."
"Yes, shop class is common in Ontario starting from grade 7.  Probably a legacy thing... I don't think they'd decide to start teaching bandsaw usage at that age nowadays... but it's been this way since anyone can remember so it's fine?  I'm okay with it."

I put the book down immediately and started working on a project that wasn't due for weeks. I am a procrastinator. A BAD one. That quote has helped me get started and accomplish things that might never have happened because I would've made excuses not to start until the window to do them was closed.   From grad school to traveling the world. Saving money or asking a girl on a date. All of these things are stuff I would hesitate on and the quote is what catapults me forward.   Changed my life."

"""Never complain about anything--ever--not even to yourself."" From the book Zen Golf by Joseph Parent. I have never played golf, but read the book in college, I believe as I had heard some of the content helped some poker players, and I was reading every poker book I could get my hold 'em addict little hands on.   The quote really stuck with me, and I tried to change my life to be more positive, and not let the negatives keep me from success.   The quote is directly about how those complaining about the weather conditions during a rain delay in a golf tournament shot worse when it resumed. And also how focusing on the bad (""don't hit that sand trap, don't hit that sand trap"", as the golf example) causes you to end up in bad situations. You need to picture your golf ball (or life) landing right in the middle of the fairway. Don't picture all the things that can go wrong in your day, week, year, or life - envision the good stuff, and watch it come true."
For some reason the concept stuck with me.  I'm the type of person that roots for the bad guy in movies and games though so ..

"I was having real difficulty getting my work schedule and other factors to allow me to take my final class for my associates. It's taken me 10 years to get this far. Anyway, after explaining the many hurdles to my best friend he said ""Maybe that's just fate or the universe saying you should wait.""  Without thinking I quickly said ""No, it's times like these I fight harder."" I didn't think much of it but little by little I started clearing hurdles. I'm poised to be able to take the class and graduate this spring and get a certification which would allow me to get a much better paying job. I'll be a life changer if all goes as planned.  I thought about that conversation a lot today as I was able to enroll. The universe or fate doesn't send messages. If it was trying to communicate it wasn't saying anything, it was more of a test to see how much I care, what I would be willing to do in order to get what I want. It made success all the more satisfying."

I got on well with my therapist, until a few months down the line she asked why I always defended my mom despite her neglect and abuse.  It was like a light switch went on in my head-- Outward, I was really stubborn and clammed up with the therapist, but inwards I felt like a ton of missing puzzle pieces of my life were finally falling into place, but I was in serious denial.  Her question paved the way for significant changes in my perception, attitude, and identity over almost 10 years of therapy."

"Yeah, man, that's pretty much my motto.   Some months ago I was at a music festival with some friends of mine, and we noticed some guys and girls danging weird, like, just dancing for the sake of it, doing whatever move you think about even if it's not good or skillful, we were laughing, having a good time, then of course they notices us, and in they start getting closer to us, they just won't stop dancing, and my friends, well some got a bit freaked out, some just stayed serious, others just kept laughing but no one joined in, then I stop for a moment and think:   ""What memory will this bring me if I just stay here and laugh?""  The answer: ""Hey guys remember when we saw some dudes dancing weird and we laughed?"" - ""Yeah, that was funny...""  Then I thought, that's fucking lame and I already have too many stories like that, it's time to say ""fuck it"" and go on with the fun.  So I joined it with the dancing, not really knowing what I was doing but I was cheered on by the other guys and that kept me dancing (along with the music) one by one my friends start coming in too, finally they all join and even some other people join too, what started as 1 group of ~4 people dancing, ended as a group of ~20 people dancing, and we danced so much and so fun, we were all having a good time, at the end we all get in a big hug for the guy who started it all, we didn't even talk afterwards because I think we didn't even felt the need to talk afterwards, we didn't even get to know the other people's names or anything, all we had was that spontaneous burst of dancing crazyness and the mutual respect we earned at that moment, knowing we had each other's backs for anything during that festival.  Now when my friends and I remember it, we don't have the lame memory of ""The funny dudes that we laughed at."" now we have memories of the funny dudes we laughed at, that we later danced with and all the crazy moves that each one of us that was pulling off and how ridiculous it all looked while it felt so good.  If you want to become an interesting person, choose this motto.  As /u/Nicoleriz said, ""life became a lot more interesting."" it does happen, and trust me, it's worth it.  Some of you might say, ""I'd rather stay and play videogames then go to that party at Joe's"", well I used to say this too, and it was a lonely road the one that I used to walk, just by going to parties, life itself becomes much more funny and interesting."

Just a guess. I'm all for being playful in a relationship, but ""you be Georgia, and I'll be Sherman"" is probably a warning sign."

"I can certainly see where you're coming from, and I agree that life with only joy is pretty boring. But to continue with your parent metaphor, yes, a good parent doesn't just give a child everything they want, but also a good parent doesn't let their child lick the wall outlets. In fact, a good parent does more to prevent suffering than God seems to.

"I used to play MUDs. One of them that I played had a splash screen with a quote from Orwell's 1984:  ""If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable, what then?""  Preteen me felt a burning need to answer this question, and after a couple of weeks I finally composed a response:  ""Then we must improve our minds, for the sake of improving the world.""  I was already a rather bookish kid, but this really kicked it into overdrive and has fueled a lifelong passion for philosophy and science. Admittedly I haven't _done_ anything even remotely spectacular with my ""expanded awareness""... and in fact, it's quite frustrating to live in the modern world as a result of having it... but I delight in knowing that in my own way I've made the world a better place.  *I had never read 1984 - and still haven't, though I've absorbed it through geek-osmosis. It wasn't until my mid 20s that I realized the quote was a rhetorical missive on brainwashing and my response was entirely inappropriate within the context of the book.*"
"That quote has never been more real for me than the time I told the girl I was crushing on that I was graduating college with honors.   She was surprised in a ""how the hell is that possible"" kind of way. Apparently in the year we had been hanging out, drinking to excess, and getting high multiple times a week, I never gave her the impression that I was smart. The whole situation hit me like a ton of bricks, and since then I always try to be aware of how my actions come across to other people."

I do think people can change their reaction to pain. By reaction I mean the sequence of thoughts and feelings that cascade from a pain stimulus (emotional or physical). I am not talking about what they “do” in response to the pain. I’m talking about the actual knee jerk response of the brain from an external stimulus. This sequence often results in a physical action but what I’m interested in is earlier in the causal chain.  A software analogy is useful here. If you think of pain as a signal input, the reaction would be the script that runs in your brain when that signal is detected. The signal analogy is easy to understand when it is external, like pain travelling over nerves to the brain, but it applies just as well to internal pain signals (memories). For example, if you swear when you stub your toe, or you cringe when you remember an embarrassing moment, or you get mad when someone insults you, all these reactions are open to change.  This is the “suffering” part. You can call it a script, or a reaction, or a mental habit, or a qualia. Either way it is an ingrained response in your mind that is outside of your immediate conscious control. I like to think of them as habits because they have the property of becoming harder to modify the more they are run. Like streams being etched into mighty rivers by the continuous flow of water. They can be positive or negative but I would qualify them as suffering when the habit extends or magnifies the initial pain input.  These habits are, at least in part, learned. This can be seen in children when they fall and hurt themselves. The severity of their reaction to the pain is often based on the parent’s reaction to the child falling. It is not hardwired. This is why people vary in their pain tolerance; they learn how to respond to pain based on past experiences. The input may be the same but the reaction can differ. You talk a lot about confusion of terms but you are combining these concepts. The pain is not the reaction to the pain. The same input can be felt in different ways, often in the same people. For example, many women are hyper sensitive to pain during menstruation. Monks can light themselves on fire and sit silently through the agony. People can get sexual pleasure from being whipped. Witnessing the suffering of another can make one man feel pity and another man feel joy. It is not hardwired.  Habits can be changed, people do it all the time, but old habits are sticky habits. Mighty rivers. Pain response is one of the oldest habits you learn. So no most people can’t turn pain into pleasure but they can turn cringing at an embarrassing memory into laughing at your past self. It just takes the same approach as learning not to bite your nails: repetition, repetition, repetition. You don’t stop biting your nails by ignoring it. No, you stop biting your nails by being aware of your actions and actively changing them. The same applies to thinking, be aware of your thoughts and actively change them, don’t try to push them away. That’s how you “choose” not to suffer. It’s not easy but meditation can help, drugs can help, therapy can help, there are many different methods. The important message here is that it CAN be changed with effort and suffering isn’t inevitable, just like the quote says."

"I've (almost) always been an atheist, and the more I learned about the history of religion, the more I came to hate it.  I assumed that science was inherently superior because it was based on observation and logical reasoning. Then I became friends with a deeply religious person who was also very curious and interested in science.  As I argued with her about religion vs. rational observation, she very wisely pointed out that, often, science has to explain something which you cannot directly observe.  In this case, aren't you taking a somewhat religious leap of faith in believing that your conclusion is sound? Ever since, I have still preferred science, but no longer thoughtlessly dismiss religious convictions."

One task they have to do is quickly build a viable list of candidates.  This means taking a stack of 100 résumés down to a workable 20 and one of the easiest ways is by checking education.

I grew up in a conservative household in the Bible belt of Texas, though I myself had struggled with faith for awhile. You can imagine how my beliefs were never really challenged because I surrounded myself with like minded people.  And that line of thinking led to my belief that homosexuality and gay marriage were not only wrong, but disgusting. That among other things.   Then I met my wife, who is from Russia and thinks in completely different ways than I did. Where everyone else would either agree with my beliefs, either because their beliefs were the same or out of a desire to avoid confrontation, she wasn't afraid to challenge mine.  One day before we were married, we were discussing gay marriage and homosexuality and she slapped every argument I had to the side like the shitty arguments they were.  By the end of the conversation and her statement I couldn't help but agree, and feel ashamed. And then she just smiled and said, ""It's OK. Everyone has room to grow, there's always time to form new opinions.""  I made it an effort from that point on to challenge every belief I knew and if my argument didn't hold water, I changed it. There were some things I had been conflicted about but too afraid to confront because they were different from my parent's politics. I found the courage to dig deep and I feel like I honestly made myself a better person. Not because I'm ""on the right side"" of beliefs or anything but because I feel like my beliefs and arguments have real conviction and standing now.

The number one answer has never left the back of my mind.   ""I wish I hadn't worked so much. ""  Call me a lazy ass. Call me what you will. When I depart this world I would like more memories of my wife, family, and friends than I would remembering the damn cover letter of those TPS reports."

"I think it's important to clarify that this is in painful situations. Lots of people during and after my divorce said things like ""there's plenty of fish in the sea"", but I didn't want anyone but my wife. It just made me feel worse and when my co-worker told me straight up that he was willing to listen. Being able to complete sentences with him, and tell him how I was feeling allowed me to work things out in my own way without the influence of someone else interfering with my judgement. It really doesn't apply with advice that is welcomed. All those people who cared for me were great people, but they tried to make me feel better immediately through their advice, when what I really needed was to be sad and have someone listen to me.   I hope that clears it up for you!"

"But that's exactly my point. You can't change being gay, witnessing something traumatic at war, or getting raped. You can adjust your attitude to not let it consume you. And I'm not just saying snap your fingers and feel happy. It takes work and time. And I understand the pure despair these people might feel, but you can't change the past and doing nothing certainly won't help either. I'm not saying anyone can do it either. Some people have been so worn out and drained by their lives that they don't have the strength to overcome. It usually doesn't turn out too well for these people"

"For as long as I can remember, I've always had horrendous anxiety.  It took a few times of my dad saying this over the course of me growing up from child, to teen, to adult, but eventually it sunk in.  This helps me SO MUCH when my nerves or stress levels start causing me to lose sleep or not be able to relax and think clearly:  ""It doesn't do you or anybody else any good to worry.  Do what you can, and stop worrying."""

"Holding onto anger is more like shitting your pants to torture your enemies with the smell.  I mean, it's not *completely* ineffective, but that still doesn't make it worth it.  The other thing I heard was that depression is basically anger minus enthusiasm - which makes anger just enthusiastic depression.   Anger is a miserable emotion. Ditch it as quickly as you're able."

"Well I will say I grew up with no real worries about food and shelter. I had enough to eat and a warm home in a cold country where homeless people are at real risk of freezing to death in winter. I had an adequate education and a library card so I read as many books as I could get my hands on and I believe my easy access to knowledge as benefited me greatly. These are the things I think about when times are hard. I live a modest lifestyle without a lot of financial freedom, share a house with 4 roommates and have to take the bus everywhere, support myself and know that if I want more financial freedom or become discontent with this lifestyle I will have to be smart about it and figure out how to juggle work, school, and debt because I'm not about to be handed a free education any time soon. My family life growing up was kind of strange and it sucked ass and eventually I had to make a choice between the privileges it offered and my own psychological well-being. A hard decision, but I own it and don't regret it. When times seem tough and I get into a self-pitying mode I remind myself that I have a warm comfortable place to sleep that is mine, that having enough to eat has never been a concern and that I have the freedom to do what I want with my free time and never really worry about my own safety. Believe it or not acknowledging these things actually does help me feel a bit better.  BUT. I will say this. Just because other people face problems that could be judged to be more serious than yours, doesn't mean that yours are less legitimate. I believe self-pity and self-congratulatory attitudes are to be avoided in equal measure because they both hinder us from approaching others with empathy. However one of the limitations of human consciousness is that we *can't* experience other people's hardships. We can try to empathize and understand them, but we'll never know what it's truly like to experience another's life the way they do. So while your problems may be no big deal in the scheme of things, that might not make the way YOU experience them any less real. It can help to reframe your perspective a bit, but it won't eliminate the problem entirely.  To put it simply: Sometimes shit sucks, and the fact that somebody else's shit sucks harder doesn't make your shit suck any less.  I've been going through a personal low lately, and when I started having destructive thoughts about myself I took the first step of filling out an online form for a local counseling service. What you're describing sounds like a warning sign for depression. I encourage you to talk to somebody if these thoughts about people being better off without you have been a longtime thing."

"I lost a friend from grad school that constantly tried to force me to open up. I find myself wondering how different things could have been if he just backed off and let me work through my issues the way I wanted to. He took offense at me not confiding every detail of my life. I took offense that he thought he was owed my personal business. He eventually made it clear that was his expectation of what a friend was and I made it clear I would never be that kind of friend. He decided to part ways and while I didn't necessarily want that, I wanted my privacy more."

"I did the 1 batch per day method for years because my parents did it that way, until I had to go take care of my grandparents for a bit, and they did the dishes after every meal so I went along with that even though it seemed very inefficient to me.  If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend it. Dishes are so much easier to clean when they're fresh, especially cheese, fuck cheese. Even though it has to be done more often, I was cleaning 3 peoples dishes and it only took like 5-10 minutes to clean them, dry them by hand and put em away. The kitchen was always spotless, too."

I felt like I was such a bad human being, so I stopped going to Sunday mass for about a year. Finally had the courage to confess all my sins, and said that i was ashamed. Too embarassed to even go to church on Sundays.   The priest told me something that really changed the way I think about God:  ""Do your parents still let you eat dinner even when they were mad at you? Do you think they'll intentionally let you go hungry? Do they stop loving you because you werent a good kid?""   And it hit me. As long as I worked on being a better person, there was no point in denying myself the love God offers."

"This never truly hit me until I started making a 12 hour round trip once a month to see an ex gf. I realized that if I drove 10 mph over the speed limit, I'd save myself 15 minutes each way. 15 minutes on a 6 hour trip. Totally not worth it. And even less on shorter distances. So I don't have to dodge around traffic and get mad when someone is going 2 or 3 mph under the speed limit. It's literally not going to affect my day at all unless I get mad about it."

"In 90's Southern California I was told by the owner of a large farming company that Mexican immigrants are honest, hard workers that greatly benefit our economy. This blew my mind coming from a household that believed Bill Clinton was a clown and illegal immigrants were all on welfare, sucking away our tax money. It became a slippery slope toward liberalism. Soon I realized gay people aren't deviants, lower taxes no matter what the cost isn't sound economic policy, and morality isn't determined by a magical sky fairy. The rest was done with a sound brain washing by my college professors and today I am a logical human being."

"I was jogging with a friend of mine from a local running club.  At that time I was 35, single.  My friend was 55, married for about 30 years.  He was a father figure to me (him being the running veteran, me being the newcomer).  I really enjoying running with him as we would discuss many topics along the way, including running, politics, work and life in general.  Anyway, he already knew I was single, and for the first time he asked me how old I was.  ""35"" I answered.  Without missing a beat, he drops this: ""If you ever want to get married, you might as well do it now.  The older you get, the more selfish you become.""  That stuck with me for years because, well, it was true.  I lived and enjoyed single life, but in recent years I had become really intransigent: stuff must always go my way.  I had a string of several short-lived relationships as I was unwilling to compromise, commit or change.  I had never thought about it until that moment: I was fussy and intransigent.  I could either choose to live that way or make a honest effort to change: be more flexible, don't expect my significant-other to be exactly what I wanted her to be, compromise and move forward.  Ten years later, and five years into my marriage, I live and extremely happy life.  For this, I thank my beautiful wife, my daughter and you, Mr. Barquet.  I haven't seen or heard from you in eight years.  I hope to jog with you sometime in the future, just to tell you how thankful I am for your advice.  Keep hitting those 26.2, or I will catch you, old man."

It's just over a year since I last seen her, and even though I've only been dieting for almost 7 months, I've lost 130lbs+. I haven't started working out again yet, though, but the muscles I had before are showing through again, so it looks like I have been working out. Close enough, right?"

"I'm gonna have to agree with you, but probably for a different reason than most.  School is pretty much the only area where cheating off of someone else's work is considered bad. In the rest of life, the better you are at copying the good stuff someone else can do, the better you are doing. It's all copycatting here, a.k.a. collaborating. The real world cares about results, not about whether you came up with them all by yourself.  A good cheater can be a good worker. It means you're good at getting done what needs to be done."

"When I was twelve or thirteen years old I was playing in a weekend baseball tournament. My father and the dad of a fellow teammate would sit out behind the fence in the outfield and have beers while we played our games. We had just won our morning game and had a 3 hour break between coming back to play the semifinal matchup in the afternoon. Me and my teammate walked back to the outfield to go meet our parents with the intention of going to get some food at a restaurant. As we're leaving I noticed my buddy's dad was leaving his lawnchair (typical cheap walmart type) behind and exclaimed ""Hey peter, are you leaving your chair?"" He answered with a simple ""Yep."" To which I replied ""What if someone steals it?"". He looked back at me with a grin and said ""Dysflexic, If someone steals that chair from me... They probably need it more than I do."" Little did I know that those words would forever impact my relationship with material possesions. It helped me deal with my first, second, and third time experiencing minor theft throughout my life.   Whoever stole my ugly spring jacket with a 10$ bill in the pocket from the rec-center a few years later... definetly needed it more than I do. Same with brand new Blue-Jays hat when I was 18 at a house-party, and again with my the 60$ taken out of my wallet when I was 21. I choose to believe that the people responsible needed those possesions more than I ever will."

"""No solution, no problem""  Problems are things to solve. If there's nothing to be done, it's not a problem, it's an environment.  e.g. I have a headache. Can I do anything about it right now? No?

"I never combined pain with the reaction to pain. I specifically separated my posts into two parts. Please reread them again because I don't know how to address your points without repeating myself. My first half of the post was about the actual experience of pain (qualia). My second was about recurring thoughts. I explicitly separated them.  You seem to be completely ignoring genetics. Women, for instance, are more sensitive to pain in general. Gingers are less. Do you believe this won't affect things? People who respond differently to things often do so because of different genetics. There is masochism (this entire area is extremely poorly covered - I don't recommend going here).  I don't think we should be using monks from remote regions who number in single digits as evidence of anything. I would imagine the military would employ this if it worked all that well. I mentioned earlier things that can modify the brain: surgery, experience, drugs. Being a monk is such an unusual situation that those people will have nothing in common with the rest of the world and they could have very well changed their brains. That doesn't mean it's the sort of experience anyone else wants to have: it is essentially just another form of trauma. It's like putting yourself into an empty room for years or other unusual situations. That may actually change your brain but it's not applicable to regular people and it often doesn't come for free.  You are completely ignoring my examples: chronic pain, depression, PTSD. Do you really think your approaches properly address these? Would these issues, then, not be trivial to fix by any middling health professionals? Yet PTSD persists and doesn't go away easily at all.  You don't get to promote methods by only noticing successes. You also need to note the failures. And if there are far more failures than successes, it may not be that great of a method. People talk and talk about how you can control everything, and yet nobody controls anything, people get obese, people get depressed, people commit suicide. Most people can't easily not suffer, so I'm not interested in methods that work for one guy on a hill: I want methods that work for most people. In my experience, most of these don't work, and the arguments for trying to prove that they work get more and more fantastical as the discussion progresses.  It's all nice to talk about how people just ""choose"" to suffer, how they should just do all these things and everything is fine, until you start applying it giant populations. Then suddenly you're forced to learn that regular people have their problems and a lot of these philosophies and approaches have a whole set of prerequisites that these people fail in large numbers."

"As stated it's kind of innacurate. At a minimum it would be more accurate to say if you can't explain it, you don't understand it.  You can still know it, understand parts of it, have a working understanding of it (understand how it works), simply understand it non verbally (or partially so), or even understand it verbally and hella suck at explaining things.  Also, if that principle is bothering you too much you could ruthlessly apply it to itself.  Also I can tell you that as someone who's really good at explaining things, I can sometimes help people understand things that they understand way better than I do, just by having the general skill, so it can't be universally applicable, though there is certainly a good idea in there."

During the separation, my former (late) supervisor, a huge man with a deep voice and a big heart, saw me crying at my machine and pulled me aside to talk. I explained that her behavior was driving me to near insanity and I would get extremely angry over the smallest things.  His words were simple. ""You don't have to""   I was like WTF? I can't even help it! And then it hit me. He was absolutely right. My reaction was the ONLY thing I could control in the situation.  He was the best supervisor I ever had. He passed away shortly after my divorce. Thank you Wayne Davis. A truly gentle giant."
"According to what? It contains a drug, which by definition is a substance that causes physiologic changes. Many people have coffee every single day, several cups potentially, and without it they will be irritable and 'off'. Same with weed. Many people function better with the coffee - caffeine is known to enhance mental function and generally boost performance. Same with weed, for some.   We can even get into the other details of the drugs, for example, caffeine is infinitely more dangerous than THC in terms of LD50. The only reason it's 'weird' to smoke a bowl every morning is the stigma around the drug, not because it's functionally so different from coffee, tobacco, khat, etc."
"This applies to anyone going through a painful time. When my mother was battling cancer for the third time, a friend of mine told me ""I've been there, and I'll be here"". My mother passed away and I just got so sick of everyone saying ""if you need anything, just let me know"". I didn't want to ask for anything. I just needed someone to sit down and listen. Not to offer advice or tell me it will get better. Just listen and give me a hug if I needed it. I offer this to friends going through tough times. Some talk, some don't but they know I'm there if needed."

"Driving is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Driving is not an exercise in getting from point A to point B most efficiently. It is an exercise in getting from point A to point B alive.   This idea has completely changed the way I drive. I drive near the speed of traffic or slower. I try to keep plenty of space between me and other cars. I always have an out if someone were to swerve, crash, or move into my lane. I slow down at stoplights and never assume anyone is going to follow the rules or notice me until I see them do it.   I have had quite a few people in my circle of relatives or acquaintances die in car accidents, but what really hit it home for me was a video. I think I found it on /r/morbidreality or something like that, and I'm not even sure why I watched it. It was a car wreck. An SUV was driven by a drunk driver into a lightpole and caught fire. You could hear screaming, and when I read the comments I realized the screaming was the girls in the back seat who were trapped and were burned alive.   I now emotionally understand why I want to drive safe. And why there's only one way to drive. Staying alive, from point A to point B.  (quick edit: my memory is weak, but the video might be [this one](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=996_1336098700) . Really, though, don't watch it. Just drive safely.)"

My current situation is a stepping stone I guess you could say.  I say this to myself in my head and grit my teeth on a regular basis.  I'm also a distance runner, and when I'm booking it at mile nine and feel like dying, I repeat this in my head.  Once I'm at this point I'll literally drop dead before I fail to meet whatever expectation I set for myself."

And that she will be able to move on and be happy again.

Usually, I find quotes I relate to more often than ones that make me think. Then again, I spend an inordinate amount of time on Tumblr, so I guess that makes sense.      Life lessons are more easily learned when you experience them, anyway. Someone telling you how things really are is helpful and all, but the more stubborn you are, or the less you think of them as a person, the less likely you are to take their advice into account. Not to mention context. Sometimes just *telling* a person something isn't enough. Everyone learns differently. Not just in school, but in life. Like... Some people will never figure things out unless they're allowed to make their own mistakes. But that's okay. Just taking everything you're told at face value and never experiencing any of it for yourself isn't really an interesting way to live anyway.

"I could be talking out of my ass here, but I believe that kids who are often the rambunctious crazy types in high school usually end up being the most well adjusted to life. Their parents give them just enough parenting to make them good kids, but still let them do most of what they want as long as it won't severely harm them or anyone around them.  Because these kids get to experience whatever they want to, and because they get a taste of what life is like when you do whatever you want, it forces them to adjust better to what is around them.  This is as opposed to the kids who are sheltered by abusive,  (neglectful might be a better word) often ridiculously religious parents who think that coddling and hyper-monitoring their kids is a valid way to parent. They then grow up to be wrecks in actual life because of it, and can't deal with what life throws at them because it isn't like home."

"Honestly, it pisses me off how people can spew this shit about how high GPA students either ""lack people skills"", ""are too afraid of failure"", or ""do nothing but study and don't know how to have fun"" and everyone is okay with that. But as soon as someone mentions something along the line of ""your 2.50 GPA doesn't look good as a representation of your discipline and probably indicates you don't understand the content very well you get the whole ""GPA DOESN'T INDICATE THE TRUE LEVEL OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE OR YOUR PERSONALITY."" People like pulling whatever fits their agenda it seems.  It's true in some cases that there's those kids that do nothing that study, but in my experience maybe like 1/10 of the kids who have really high GPAs will be that kid. The others just study a bit more than average and are generally better at understanding concepts. Most of the kids that have super high GPAs in my program are really cool and have fantastic communication skills. There's one kid in particular that is the ""does nothing but study"" guy, but I had my 2nd year design project with him and he was honestly fantastic in a group work setting. Sure I probably wouldn't hang out with the guy, but buddy is going to do absolutely fine in the workplace, because even though his social skills aren't fantastic, the guy knows how to do good work and can communicate well enough."
"You know what else you can't change? But you can't change being dead. You can adjust your attitude, though! Oh, wait... and being dead is better than some other things... some of these things change you as a person so much you're a new person now. That other person is dead. Not bad enough yet?  How bad does it need to get for you to start worrying about how bad the event is as opposed to telling people to change their attitude? To realize that something that happened may be unrecoverably bad?  It doesn't turn out well for those people. Yeah, exactly. It doesn't turn out well for quite a few such people, actually. I find it interesting you put them at the very end of your paragraph like that. Like they're some few people. Side occurrence. Why brush them off like that?  Also, according to the earlier ""always"" those people should not exist at all. But they do. And what if a lot of them exist? What does that do to the ""attitude"" argument? Maybe it's better to change the situation after all?  You said you can always change attitude but not circumstances. But you could not have a war, not have a rape, and not have a social attitude towards being gay. We have changed those things. We have a lot less crazy wars, we have better attitudes towards trauma and gay people. Seems like it was a hell lot easier to change those things than to shut all those people up. Those things work a LOT better than changing one's attitude. Those damn people and their attitude, eh? Why don't they just shut up instead of changing their circumstance?  Changing the attitude is what happens after the fact. When you already lost. When you admit defeat. When you say you can't change it anymore. Never once have you considered stopping the event from happening. You don't even seem to allow for the victims to stop such a thing from happening to others in the future.  ""Just change your attitude"" is empty advice that doesn't want to admit the utter failure of the situation and start thinking about actually changing the reality. It just keeps clinging to some fragile hope of some remainder of will somewhere instead of just admitting what actually happened. Because we don't want to live in a world where really bad things from which people can't recover, can't change their attitude, can happen. We always want to believe that there's a tiny sliver of anything that they can still recover so we don't have to feel all that bad when they nonetheless don't and just blame them and so that we don't have to think about anything like that happening to us and us not being able to handle it."

If only I could go back in time and say that, hoping it would resonate with them like it did for you.   When you come from a dysfunctional environment it is hard to change and leave those habits behind, but the important thing is you are trying."
"It's true. All things change and pass away. Clinging to them inevitably causes suffering. As yoda said, train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. At first this sounds like impossible advice, but it is only in letting go that we are able to truly be at peace with anything. Doesn't mean you didn't love what you lost, but you don't cling to it."
"Wayne Dyer -- When you squeeze an orange, orange juice comes out, because that's what's inside.  What comes out of you when you are squeezed is what's inside you.    I have always had anger issues and under pressure, I realized what comes out of me is not a very good person. So I've worked hard to change that, to be a better more patient person and in times of stress I work to not lash out at others but to be the person I want to be."

Been there too! When I lost an ex 4-ish years ago I had just moved to a new city and this was my first time really moving on my own too.    I didnt have your expectations but I got all of those anxious thoughts about having to leave all the future dreams I had about living in this city. Which I still do now today btw ^^
I can't remember if that line was in the book or just in the movie. Does Stephen King deserve the credit?
"Lol. It's funny because your last statement, I'm like, ""exactly, he gets it, "" but then i read everything above it. Just a matter of opinion i guess.

You can have bad habits but still be a decent person, is what it comes down to really."

"I'm way late to the party, but I invested in a business that failed.  When I told my friend it had finally failed, he said ""Good.  One down, three to go until you succeed.""  The number 3 was meant to be arbitrary, but it made a lot of sense.  My next thing probably wont work either, but eventually if I keep at it, there are a finite amount of failures that will lead to success."

And now that I think about it, isn't all we really want is to have people be kind to us?"

"Learning your mother tongue is a whole different thing than learning your second language.  You learn by exposure and repetition. You can speak like a sir and have no clue of writing or grammar.  That's why everybody struggles with grammar rules on their mother tongue.  Second languages though... They are learnt in a more methodical way. Usually foreigners have a better understanding of precise grammar rules than locals, as locals basically don't give a fuck.  I had a colleague form London living in Frankfurt which helped Germans correct their formal emails. He was proficient in German obviously, and Germans usually went into ""are you serious??"" mode with some of the corrections.  I have in front of me some of the most expensive, thick and serious grammar books for German and English. The English one is a normal textbook. The German ones come in three volumes and they are like the bastard children of ""Calculus"" and The Holy Bible."

"That's easy to say, but not even yourself, but if someone truly wronged someone you love, it's hard to just let it go.  Like my daughter's ex-bf was much older.  He got her hooked on Heroin as nearly a teen.  For a few years I would cry at night because I thought every day the police were going to come and tell me my daughter was dead.   She had cardiac arrest multiple times in 18 months.  It was worse than if she had gotten cancer, yet it came from a person.  I know, I know, as HIS enabling parents said ""everyone has choices"", well I am 40+ and I never seen Heroin before my daughters problem, so if it's not around, it's actually not a life choice.   I hate that MAN that is closer to my age than my daughters.   I wish bad Karma on him and his family.   Sure, it may be poison for my soul but it was poison to my daughter's body and soul."

"As an Engineering student I have had a similar experience. We have a general first year, and I did fairly well probably in the top 10-15% of the class or so. When I went into second year I specialized in a selective program that only people from near the top end of the class can get into. This resulted in me making friends who were really smart, and for the first time in my life I was surrounded by people who were ""smarter"" than me (by ""smarter"" I mean they had higher GPAs than me).  After spending a lot of time with these guys, I eventually realized most of these guys really aren't smarter than me. I'm just as intelligent as they are, but they just work harder than I do so they get better grades. This motivated me to work harder, and as a result my GPA has been steadily increasing every year. It sounds kind of petty, but seeing these guys all having higher GPAs than me made me unsatisfied with what my GPA was, so it made me want to strive to improve it more. Whereas if I went into another program, where I would have been in the top 10-15% of the people there, I probably would have been content with that and wouldn't have worked the same way to achieve better results."

"In a bit of bad place at the moment. I've been spewing negative crap on Reddit because I'm frustrated with things in my life. This thread reminds of an event that transpired which did change me profoundly and even now I think maybe I need to cut the negative crap out and get back to work at what I want.  Been abused most of my life and haven't had many friends. I kind of let that drama slip into my 20's. Decided I wanted a change in life and had nothing to lose, met a girl on OK Cupid, and went on a date. I'll never forget that we went to hang out a second time and were driving. I dislike rap, she put on some Slick Rick, and I immediately start bitching about it. She pulls her Jeep over and says, ""If you're just going to be negative the whole time you can get out right now."" At that moment I realized how poisonous everything in my life had got and I began to change. Her name was Maddie and I only saw her twice, but she changed my life.  Going through a rough patch now and Reddit reminded me of that. Don't know if this will get buried at almost 15,000 comments, but I'm glad, at this moment, I am reminded of that exchange. I became a better person from it. Maybe I need to stop spewing negativity on Reddit like I have been the past few days."

I always remember this whenever I feel like giving up."
"I would argue that this mentality doesn't work for creating great music or art. It's why I think pop music today is just made up of these fast-food, cookie-cutter, four-chords songs that producers spit out in order to meet the pace of trends.  It's like no one cares about quality! No one cares to appreciate amazing entertainment or experiences! Everyone just passively listens to this music while driving or working and never sits down to go through the journey of emotions that a great piece of music can deliver!  It's all about making it good enough to arouse maybe five different emotions *at most*, and sticking with the script that works for le monies.  It's a goddamn crime."

"I went to the Himalayas for a trek in 2014. I was thoroughly unfit but something pushed me to do it. It was an 8 day trek and it was **really** tough for the first 2 days. The trek is called Kashmir Great Lakes because we see 7 of Kashmir's greatest lakes. The first 2 days however we spent just gaining altitude and didn't see any Lakes at all. This along with all the fatigue really demotivated me and I almost thought of giving up and returning. On the 3rd day, my Trek Lead was talking to some other people who were complaining of leg pains and what I overheard him say that day has changed my life notably since that day. He said _""Pain is mandatory, suffering is optional""_. And the instant I heard that, everything seemed to just fit into perspective. We saw the first lake on that day - Vishusar and I spent 45 minutes in front of the lake - Tears rolling down my cheek. I heard lots of people calling out to me but I just couldn't move. That day really turned my life around.  Since then, I've done 1 more Himalayan trek - Goechala in 2015 and a lot of smaller treks around the city. Running has become a passion of mine and I am **much** more fit than I was. I've been in situations which have pained me a lot (mentally and physically) but I just recall that day on the mountains and from somewhere, I'm able to muster enough strength to deal with it.   I can't thank Parth Phalke (My Trek Lead) enough for that day."

"Not said to me, but this quote completely changed my outlook on life.  As a kid, I was depressed. A lot. My family has a history with depression, and often we would feed off one another's depression and spiral down together. I also didn't feel like I had an identity as a person, if that makes any sense. Like I walked the earth anonymously until I die and am buried by time and dust. Part of me thinks that's because I didn't have connections to the things that I love now: metal music, video games, and, of all things, stand up comedy.  Enter George Carlin. I became a fast fan of his when I first heard Jammin' in New York and Carlin on Campus, and my parents bought me a daily calendar of Carlin quotes, pulled from Brain Droppings, mostly. One quote stuck out with me:  ""Most people with low self-esteem have earned it.""  It took Carlin issuing a statement like that, which questioned esteem issues and self-loathing in a poignant, short sentence for me to think, ""have I earned my depression?"" My immediate answer was, ""no,"" and in the past, I had wallowed in self-pity at the assertion that yes, I'm depressed, it's not my fault, and there's nothing I can do. After reading that quote, that wasn't the case any more. Couldn't explain why, and still can't adequately explain why. To this day, my adherence to this quote is one of the least ""like me"" things I've ever done. It ended up helping to make me a productive, happy person. It's almost a mantra.  Ironic that a man who once derided self-help books happened to give me the closest thing to a self-help quote I've ever put to practice."

"This one is a recent one, but it is definitely one that I will never forget There is a popular YouTube channel named drama alert that posts gaming news, and recently this guy has been exposing pedophiles in the gaming community. Well this guy got one really important story wrong, and falsely accused a 62 year old twitch streamer of being a sex offender that had sex with an underage woman he 'married' on the online game runescape. After he told his almost 600k subscribers this, many of them went on his twitch and social media, and started to harass him, calling him a pedophile and telling him to go kill himself and so on. There was almost 10'000 people harassing him on his live twitch stream, while he did nothing to deserve this and was completely innocent. Then he proceeded to break down and start crying while he was streaming. And instead of just avoiding all of the hate he was taking and getting rid of his social media and twitch, he said something that I will live with for the rest of my life. ""I will never stop doing this stream, I will not let anybody run me down because I know who I am and all of my real friends know who I am"". If I would have heard this earlier in life, I would have so many more things accomplished. This man is the most genuine person I've ever met (not in real life but you get the point) and is living the life the way he wants to, and has made it apparent that nothing can stop that. After the whole thing the YouTuber posting the false information took the video down and explained that he was wrong, Tony, the 62 year old man, is already past it and has been hitting a lot of support, the most support I've ever seen on a twitch channel, and it seems like everyone in every community has come together and supported this man, which he totally deserves. He's the most positive and nicest person ever, even if you aren't into runescape or gaming in general, he's just interesting to listen to because of his whole outlook on life. Everyone should go follow him on twitch because he deserves it his username is: rsgloryandgold Kind of a long story but if you read the whole thing then thank you for your time. YAHOOOOO"

I asked him for a few extra days on the paper, because I was worried I'd have a hard time accomplishing both. He refused. He sat me down and asked why I was worried and I said I was afraid the race would be hard. He just said, 'you wouldn't do it if it were easy.'  That's always stuck with me when I encounter a challenge."

"Got told the same thing by a former boss. She was riding my ass one shift because I had made the mistake of writing down my schedule wrong for the second time and showing up a half hour late.

I thought it was normal or funny to lock my friends in the garden if they were staying over my house or pin them down with my sisters and fill their pyjamas with food etc. when i was about 8- I'd treat anyone who wanted to be my friend like this because I honestly thought that was what you did because thats how my mum was with me. Looking back I realise that it's pretty cruel, I went on like that until I was 19. Being friends to me meant mocking someone relentlessly until they cried or them doing it to me. Now I'm better, but find it so hard working out what is normal and how to make friends that I go too far the other way and am overly submissive because I fear ever hurting someone again"
"&gt; It's not much, but I have one for you. Every day for two weeks, write down one thing you're grateful for, no matter how small.  Piggybacking off this. I started a journal a little while back when I was going through a bit of a tough patch, I thought it would be meditative and it would kind of help me reflect on my feelings. In each journal entry I make I write a ""Happy Moment"" at the end of it. Usually its something small or big that happened since the last journal entry, for example I was really happy with my marks last semester which came in recently so that was my last happy entry. Or sometimes I'll write a happy memory, or a sort of happy reflection, reflecting on how some of my past decisions have worked out well.   When you're going through rough times flipping through your journal reading all of the happy moments you've experience is at least a little bit uplifting. In the moment it also forces you think on the bright-side, no matter how bad the situation you're in, there's always something you can at least be somewhat happy about."

"It's dangerous to drive while high on weed, same is not true with caffeine. One is a stimulant and the other is a depressant - yes they are both drugs but they are thought of differently for very good reasons. I guarantee you that the dude smoking a bowl every morning will not be as productive as the person drinking their morning coffee.  I'm not trying to say you're a bad person if you smoke - it's just a bad idea to do it every day (especially because that has much worse long-term effects). There really is a good reason for the distinction."

"Uncertainty, even using rational thought you can never think through every possibility. If you try to think every step of every action through rationally, you will always be disappointed when you reach the point of uncertainty.  The average person doesn't even have the attention span to rationally think most things through to a point of complete uncertainty.  I feel like, at some point, everyone has to accept a certain level of 'how things are' or go insane.  I think belief is a healthy element of the human psyche, it becomes a bigger problem the more rigidly the belief is held."

Other people can show their concern and try to help, but ultimately it is up to you to take control of your life. You either do or you don't."

"when i was really young, i had believed that abortion was wrong and it should be illegal- because it was a termination of life before it ever had a chance to live. I think i was maybe,....10/11 years old at the time. I was just driving around town with my older sister, and we passed a planned parenthood with protesters outside. And of course, I made a comment about how I agreed with what they were protesting. And my sister explained to me, that even if i didn't believe that I could ever go through with an abortion- was I really comfortable with the idea that just because that was how i felt, and even to this day i still believe that i don't think i would ever have to emotional strength to go through with it. But my sister explained to me, that even if that was how I felt (regardless of whether or not, if it was scientifically correct or not) was I really comfortable forcing the way I felt onto every other woman in the whole country? Was I really so sure, and confident in what I thought that I was willing to make the decision for every other woman in the country for them? After that day, I realized that even I don't think I could even go through with an abortion- it doesn't mean that I should even interfere with any other woman's right to make that choice for herself. In hindsight, I was an ignorant child, who had no grasp on the social issues, or ramifications of being forced to keep a child. I can still proudly say that to this day, my sister changed my mind in that one conversation. And older me, is so happy that she was able to talk to sense into me, because she was so fucking right. (Now, I'm the crazy counter-protester outside planned parenthood holding a ""Dumbledore Lives!"" sign and singing ""Why can't we be friends"" at the top of my lungs)"

My mom's colleague looked my sister and I dead in the eye and said this to us. Apparently she and her ex husband had had an arrangement where he worked at a job and she took care of the family. Then they got a divorce, and she had 4 daughters to take care of and she'd been out of the workforce for a decade with barely any skills to draw from from her prior work.   The way she spoke to us was like an equal talking to an equal. Being 4 or 5 that was one of the first times an adult had spoken to me that way. To this day, it has reminded that nobody is going to take care of my shit for me. I've got to take care of myself."

"Yeah. Sorry this is a bit long, but requires a bit of explanation.   College history class on the Rise and Fall of Nazi Germany. (20+ years ago). The professor held a discussion on why the German people turned a blind eye to the Holocaust and other atrocities that occurred during that time period. One of the points he made was the Nazi Party portrayed Jews and other minorities as less than human.   Then, he brought the conversation back around to how Americans treat people within their own society. He compared the way the Nazis treated ""sub-humans"" to the way some Americans viewed the homeless, mentally ill, and other vulnerable minorities.   One of the other people in the class made a comment to the effect that the homeless were not her problem. They should be rounded up and taken away. They should not be anywhere near where ""decent"" people lived or worked. According to her, they were ""dirty"".  That comment by my classmate hit me hard. As a teenager I had been homeless for a while. I was in tears in the class.  The impact on me was profound. It altered the way I looked and thought about everyone. I questioned every stereotype I encountered. The very idea of thinking or treating someone as unworthy of basic respect is anathemic to me."

I don't know why but that resonated with me, because i couldn't answer his question. I wasn't raised to believe it, i wasn't raised with a religion, it was just an idea i liked.  Ever since that day i tried to educate myself as best i could on all form of belief/religion and have since found myself an Agnostic-Atheist, simply because it makes the most sense to me.  I have since thanked my Grandad for this conversation he doesn't remember, but it taught me a lot. To question eveything and to fully understand what it is i'm talking about, rather than just having faith, be knowledgeable.   Before the downvotes, i'm not having a dig at anyone, i respect people's beliefs i just have my own."

"I was driving to work and was giving a lift to a colleague. On route another driver cut in, had I not breaked hard, we would have crashed. I was furious and raging at the driver using language your mother shouldn't hear. My colleague, after listening to the barrage for several minutes, said simply; why are getting so angry at this, you won't feel good now for a while. By choosing to get angry you've kicked yourself in the foot, if you had shrugged and accepted these things happen, you'd still be having a good morning, instead you are all het up for something you cannot change. That driver you're so mad at on the other hand is oblivious - he's going to have a good day. From that moment on (about 30 years ago) I have taken his advice and I have to say it makes a real difference not just when a idiot driver cuts you up - but in life generally. It makes for a much more serene and happy existence."

"I was 18 with a girlfriend of only 2 or 3 months. With my time being well-invested in college and a 35-45 hour full-time job, I only got to see this girl 2, maybe 3 times a week if I was lucky. I had been at my place of work for close to 2 years and had all together quit going to church. Even before my job I never considered myself all too religious of a person. I didn't pray frequently, never sang along to the hymns, and could never make my mind up about what I wanted to believe, but that's beside the point. She was my third girlfriend and the first of them to regularly go to church - small/youth-group on Wednesdays and service on Sundays, the regular. Naturally, she invited me to both and I was more than happy to go! After going to a handful of these congregations I had met and had gotten to know all of the people closest to her - the pastor and all of her friends. They hung out together, worked together, went to school together, and her having this close-nit group of morally-sound friends in her life was something that I really liked! They wouldn't support her cheating or lying or hiding things from me, so this was something I naturally found some security in. ""These are decent people."" I said to myself. Yet, whenever I would go to the small-group with her and the time came around to sing... I wouldn't sing. It was nothing against them and nothing against what they were singing for, rather singing was something I simply did not do. This was noticeably bothering and unsettling to her and some of the others, even to the point of her asking me to sing. ""Can you do it for me?"" Long story short, this situation was the first 'fight' in our relationship. Continuing, I am not the kind of guy who instigates problems or controversy, so I slowly started scheduling my work over going with her to small-groups to avoid the looming discrepancy. She never asked any questions why I didn't go as often, so, thankfully, things were pretty peachy from then on. Valentine's rolls around, plans are made, and next thing you know the whole gang is going to the Spaghetti Warehouse! Don't get me wrong, I was more than happy and sincerely enjoyed hanging out with my girl and her friends. So we get to the restaurant, we eat, and talk makes its way around the table on where we would all like to go for dessert. Yogurt? Ice cream? Cheesecake? Cheesecake it was! Conveniently, this shop was within walking distance of where we were eating, so we get our coats on, bundle up, and we're on our way. Now, you guys are asking yourselves when the hell am I going to make my point?! To make clear, nothing in particular was *said* that forever changed my way of thinking, yet it was what happened to myself and each and every one of these God-loving people on our way to the cheesecake shop. It's cold, it's downtown M-town, and it's not uncommon for homeless people to be out and about. A number of you reading this have been approached or begged by a homeless person. Now, what did they ask you for? Money is probably at the top of the list, right? So, while the dozen+ of us walked down the sidewalk after our Valentine's dinners and toward our Valentine's desserts, we pass a homeless woman. A homeless woman asking not for money or food or clothes or drugs. A homeless woman asking rather for a room, a motel, a warm place to stay for the night to get out of the cold. Embarrassed for her, each and every one of us walked silently past her. Alone one of us could have gotten her a room for a night and together we could have gotten her a room for the week and changed her life. Rather, they all dismissed the situation, calling it awkward, saying they felt sorry for her, sparking up a different topic to distract from it. These were people I thought to have gumption and devotion and care ESPECIALLY for instances EXACTLY like that. Hell, I walked right past her too, so how can I sit here and say anything, you ask? Unlike them, I did not say a word. I thought and thought for weeks trying to figure out how these God-loving people could care so little for this woman yet care so much that I did not sing along to their songs. I had no religious awakening nor did develop any distaste for religion. Through this I have grown evermore optimistic. Through this I have become more generous to others. Through this I have lost my greed. And through this I have found that money is not something I need more than others, rather it is something that others need more than me."

"That I'm not entitled to anything but my life. I'm not entitled to respect, I have to earn it. I'm not entitled to love, I have to earn it. I'm not entitled to money, I have to earn it. I'm not even entitled to clean drinking water, thankfully I live in a country that has clean drinking water on tap but if I didn't, I would have to go and find some.   Loosing the sense of entitlement has made me so much happier, it has made me appreciate the things that I have and realise how lucky I am. The only expectations I have now are expectations of myself, because I know myself. I don't expect anything from anyone (love, respect, friendship, loyalty etc.) and I find this liberating.

Being 22 days under the age of 18 when that election was held, I replied 'No.  But I registered as soon as I turned 18 so I CAN vote next time!'.  That person (younger than myself), looked at me and said ""Well, if you didn't vote you don't have the right to bitch about the President.""  If I may add....  I also feel that statement holds true for people who may admire ANY elected official as well.  If you think they're doing well and you didn't vote, you don't deserve to say you think they're doing well in office either."

"It seems pretty easy to catch whether they're a drop out or are not speaking their native tongue.  Dropouts aren't verbose and don't have a large vocabulary and tend to use words like ""ur"" outside of phone texts.  I have a *lot* of experience with people from other countries attempting to speak English so I may be biased, but they're usually doing way better than the drop outs. Because they try. They might even be trying too hard.  In reality though you can tell because they're not making logical connections with grammar that someone whose only language is English would, even if they were a dropout. It's hard to explain, but easy to spot."

Crazy Germans. jk. Ofcourse there are both positive and negative faces in a group. However one will be more prevalent over the other. So that the Germans do this is a nice example of that.

"Background on this: I'm a naturally competitive guy who wants to be the best at everything I do. It's a part of my personality and something I have difficulty controlling. It's caused some conflict in my life but also has helped drive me to some success.   I used to play the drum set in my high school jazz band and my competitive side really showed through. I was surrounded by many great drummers and musicians and anytime they showed me something I didn't know how to do, I would skip lunch to find a practice room and learn how to do it.   One day one of those great drummers and trumpet player in the jazz band found me in the practice room and noticed I was learning a drum pattern he had shown me earlier in the day and asked if I had eaten. I told him no and that I just felt I had to learn it.  He said, "" You're so concerned about being the best. Why? There's so many bands in the world and they all need a drummer."" It was simple but I had literally never once thought about it that way. That one conversation has helped me stay sane as I've learned many different skills. It helped me to remember that I don't need to be the best at what I'm doing to enjoy it."

Now, I make it a deliberate habit to never clear my own mess, because if I, and all the other people did that.. well, the tables would still need to be wiped, and bins still need to be emptied - but there wouldn't be two people doing it. Right now, someone can feed their family/live life because of people *not* being 'polite'.

Or are you a decent human being for not being a greedy asshole with all your money and 'sharing' it with others by creating employment, instead of stuffing it away in a bank? Or spending it on frivolous things?  The way I see it, is that if someone is earning enough money to pay people to do things for them, and then they do that, then fucking GREAT. Compared to all the other ways of spending excess money - cars, gambling, sex etc... instead of that, you are providing someone with a job, security, livelihood. It would be a better world if more people spent their excess money hiring other people to do work for them, rather than the BS that most people end up doing."

"I was in the school choir, was in every musical production (in prominent roles). My dad didn't see any of them. On day whilst I was singing in the house he laughed and said 'God you shouldn't sing'. And I didn't for about 20 years. Then I went on holiday and every night sat in a pub where they had karaoke - I desperately wanted to sing but couldn't. When I got home I booked singing lessons, my goal: to get up and sing on a karaoke. It took my singing teacher two full lessons before they got me to sing a note and they only managed that by standing outside the studio whilst I sang inside. News flash - apparently I could sing (everyone can - though not everyone can sing in tune) and I could sing in tune. It took another three months before I could even think about singing in front of anyone other than my singing teacher but eventually built up my confidence - I bought a karaoke machine, enjoyed for the first time in a very long time just singing, and eventually after about 8 months plucked up the courage to sing a song in the local at a karaoke night, only for the karaoke man to say 'wow- beat that' to the other patrons after I had finished. That was 15 years ago. At my 50th birthday bash I had a karaoke - my dad now 87 was there - my friend and I sang a duet - everyone clapped and cheered and my dad said 'God, you shouldn't sing'. Two solos and three duets later....."

It was 75% luck and 25% talent that got me that grade. I am absolutely thankful that it happened, and I do not intend to attempt to repeat that shit this quarter. Learned my lesson, I have."

Now I never pass up an opportunity to try new things and if I don't like something I try it three times (obviously depending on what it is), also I've realized some things are better not thought through.

"This doesn't quite fit the theme of everyone else's responses, but it's something that's changed my life since it was said. In middle school I was a devout Christian. I prayed regularly, read my Bible every day, went to church every week, broke into tear-punctuated prayer whenever I did something that was bad according to the Bible. Then, one Sunday, the preacher is going on with his sermon as usual, but this time he says that you can't just stick to some general routine, what someone else does won't necessarily work for you. Says that you have to think about how to apply these things to your life. For some reason, my mind didn't think about the applications. Instead it went to what the Bible itself said; not the morals, but the rules and the assurances and the events. And there, sitting in that pew, my entire religious ideology crumbled. I can't remember how long it took exactly, though it was definitely less than half an hour. Probably between five and ten minutes, maybe fifteen to twenty. But in that time I went from loving God and trying to please Him above all else, to not even believing in Him. I've been an atheist since then. That was the summer before 8th grade, and now I'm a sophomore in college. For a long time I had problems with my family and friends because of my atheism, but my new friends in college are more accepting of it and the thought of it isn't constantly lingering with me like it was when I was living at home, where I'd see my deeply religious parents all the time. But yes, for a quote, I guess it can be boiled down to ""You can't just know it, you have to think about it."""
"I'm much happier now. Walking around filled with hate all the time is no good for anyone. There's another quote that i saw and it really hit home:  Rumi — 'Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.'  I realised regardless of your views or feelings about things, you just have to ask yourself the question 'can i do something to change this?' if the answer is no than there's no point getting angry about it as you're just hurting yourself.   My mind has opened up massively in the last few years, and i always try to treat each situation as a brand new event rather than pre-judging because of what i've been told by others. I'm no saint and i still dislike people and have a temper, but often i just remove myself from situations that i'm not happy in and at least try to engage my brain and collect all the facts before jumping to conclusions based on mindless assumptions. (which is something that many people on both sides of the fence seem to still do)"

"See the problem here is we're only getting half the information; namely you're listing all the foods you eat but not the quantities. A bowl of oatmeal could be 70g with water (~50 kcal) or 160g with 250mls of whole milk (~270 kcal) Huge difference. How much bacon are you eating, how many crackers are you having for a snack, how much pasta are you having?  Trust me, you don't eat as much as a fat person.  The getting fat as you get older thing is not 100% due to a slowing in metabolism but a few factors. A pound of fat equals out to be about 3500kcal. That means that if you take in an extra 100kcal a week you'll put on 1.5lbs a year. Multiply that by 30 and suddenly you're 45lbs heavier in your 50s than you were in your 20s, and it can creep up on you. 100kcals a week is a very small amount but that's all it will take."

"The original point was &gt; But i dont understand how can you justify kids being born in fucked up conditions ? How can you justify kids being born with aids/hiv, how can you justify hunger ? How can you justify all the fucked up shit.  Claiming that all this suffering doesn't matter because we all get an afterlife anyway IS dodging the point when the question is ""why does a loving god allow suffering on earth"".  &gt;""the suffering around the world is supposed to be our calling towards doing better and for spreading love. As humans, we're flawed and will make mistakes""  That would make sense if the only suffering in the world was caused by the actions of flawed human beings, it would give good people the chance to demonstrate their love of god through their actions.   However while you might argue that hunger is the result of mans flaws you cannot argue the same for HIV which we did not create. The logical conclusion to your argument is that god allows an innocent child to be born with HIV (which he created) so that we can use the child as a tool to demonstrate our good deeds and earn a place in heaven, never mind that the child may die of the disease within months of its birth. I fail to see how that can be interpreted as the action (or implied inaction) of a loving god who wants us to be happy while we live on earth.    &gt;We were born in perfect harmony with nature but our free will led us to be flawed. God was wrathful towards us because we were insubordinate and constantly made mistakes against his main wishes.  So for the sake of argument lets say we accept the story of creation. This means god (who is omniscient) created us, knowing in advance that we would be insubordinate and that he would punish us and that this in turn would lead to the suffering of billions of innocent people from natural evils over which we have no control, this does not just mean dead adults who have led sinful lives, but dead infants who have been unable to make meaningful choices. Again this does not sound like the action of a loving god.   As a side note i also think it's odd that god also created us with free will but then punishes us for using that free will to go against his wishes, what was the point in free will then if he is going to restrict it in such a catastrophic way?"

"This poem :  Desiderata :  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927"

We may be the 'melting pot' for all the different cultures to come and live in together, but we have our own language and contrary to popular belief IT'S NOT Spanish.  On the same note, I never make fun of anyone's broken English, we all had to learn at some point, right?  A lot of natural-born Americans can't speak as well as a lot of foreigners do.  I only get upset when I'm calling for help with something and the person who answers calls for an American company is only English speaking enough to read from a script in front of them on the computer.  They take a few key words/phrases &amp; probably ""google"" w/in their companies intranet to find an ""appropriate"" response.  I still don't make fun of their English (or lack thereof).

IDK if I was taught it or just made up my own meaning but I always thought it to mean a disbeliever in God.

Thank you for teaching me something I didn't know before!  FYI, I was going to ask:  How can you identify with being agnostic when they (agnostics) do not believe God exists?"

"Could be explained either way.

"Came here to say something along these lines. As someone who's been a pretty chill, happy-go-lucky guy all my life and who's tried out the giving-more-of-a-fuck-about-stuff thing several times, I can conclude that, at least for me, it's just not worth it.   People have told me here and there stuff like, ""I think you're too relaxed/easy-going/you don't take things seriously enough/you should be more ambitious and driven about 'x' and 'y'/you should be more proactive and a go-getter etc."", and our society often tries to tell you that you're the bad guy for not being motivated about everything, fulfilling your potential and being the 'best' and most accomplished you that you can be; but like, all of these trivial, ultimately pretty hollow, things for what?

It's not that I don't give a fuck and care about what's important and meaningful to me, of course I do, but that doesn't mean I can't be laid-back on the whole and just take the time to enjoy my life. Cause at the end of the day, while I appreciate we all need to put in the work to be able to play afterwards (and I'm pretty hardworking where I need to be, don't get me wrong, most people would call me a hardworking guy), what we really enjoy, and what we remember with a smile looking back, are simply the damn fun times we had living our lives, sometimes it's just the little things.  I've always been so happy and it's a real shame to see so many people getting so stressed out and worked up and overly-focused on things that really don't matter (at least in my eyes), especially in the grand scheme of things, instead of just stepping back for a minute, putting things into perspective and realizing the relative important of things, calmly analyzing and working things out and coming to terms with/resolving things/finding closure/doing what they gotta do if need be, and just taking the time to have some fun and enjoy their lives. What is the purpose of this whole 'life' thing anyway (don't mean to be nihilistic guys haha ;P)?

"This isn't a life motto or anything, but Mark Twain's quote 'I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it' really had me thinking about life.   Pretty much made me realize that I hadn't existed for so long, and after I use up my 80 years or so, it's back to waiting."
"I had just left my abusive ex. He tortured me - physically and psychologically - and even raped me a few days before i finally left. I took a job as a dishwasher because despite being capable and experienced my self esteem was so destroyed that i felt it was the best i could do. One day ""our song"" came on the cafe's radio and i lost it. I ran down to the basement and was just sobbing, shaking. One of the bakers (a hilarious gay man old enough to be my father) noticed something was up and followed me. I told him everything, including the worst part; that despite everything and how angry i was, i still loved him. This kind man held me for a minute and simply told me that we can't always help who we love. It instantly stuck in my heart and helped me feel better about leaving and helped me forgive myself for not being able to let go of him emotionally. I'll never forget his kindness and wisdom. He ended up passing away very suddenly of a heart attack not long after that. He taught me so much about life and about baking. I ended up becoming a full time baker and now, years later, am in a wonderful relationship with a truly decent man who treats me like a queen. Those simple words did more for me than he ever knew. I regret never having the chance to tell him that."

They all feel.  Different.  I appreciate the beauty of what's around me much more, soak it all in just like the first time.  Because I know I won't for a while.  Maybe I can only do this because I know the transition is coming, but it's still an eerie feeling.  Joyful to be sure, but strange nonetheless."

So my family was snorkeling but i couldn't not go because i couldn't paddle around without being in extreme amounts of pain, so while i was sitting on the boat alone with the captain he told me ""it only takes 3 seconds to do something that could change your life forever"" and that really changed my outlook on things like relationships and how i make decisions, and made me much less awkward of a person around everyone really, and generally improved my life since i became much less afraid to do things that i wasn't comfortable with.

We got on the topic of my ex-girlfriend at the time who I was madly in love with, to which she took advantage of. I knew talking to her would only bring pain as she didn't love me, but I knew not talking to her would also hurt.

"I am going to bely my ignorance and say yes, I had an idea of Poland as being some sort of post-Soviet wasteland. But I don't think of Russia that way, oddly enough. I wasn't stuck on the notion, it was just a a vague picture I have because all the Polish I meet are very modest about their country, plus many are economic migrants and maybe don't have the best impression of their own country or say only brief things about it. I never stopped to think hey there's tons of Mexican migrants in the USA and Mexico is beautiful and traveling there is wonderful.   Oh god we had a fucking crazy waster night in Krakow - by all accounts we should have ended up in a much worse way than we did. We went as a motley crue of my one-eyed Canadian gold miner redneck brilliant historian friend, vegan sisters from Sweden, myself (Canadian recovering hippie rebel type) and my husband (Irish, what more needs to be said) on a little honeymoon vacation. Our first night there, I left my husband alone for I swear what was only half an hour at another bar and when I came back he was giggling, being chased down the street by a group of rather large, bald angry Polish men yelling 'Hitler' at him...in the Jewish Quarter! I have NO idea what that was about. Things just got more interesting from there....we drink whiskey in large amounts but that vodka, I tell ya. The Irish just weren't built for it. Next morning we had no mobile and no bank card but were only down 100 euro for a night of complete fucking mayhem were at least one of us should have ended up in jail. Nobody in Poland tried to use the lost VISA and someone even returned our mobile to a random lost and found place with no spurious calls made. I feel bad he/we were such asshats but it increased my respect for Poland tenfold. People could see I was struggling to keep my husband (who was happy-wasted, not aggro-drunk) from chasing cars down streets etc and lent a hand and nobody took advantage of the situation.  And just in general, it was fall and the surrounding forests were so magical. Walking around Krakow was just enjoyable, it felt like a place I could spend more time in and I generally don't care for cities. Except the coal smog, that kind of sucked. The showers were hotter and the internet better than Ireland too haha. And those 10 feet long sub sandwiches they sell (ok maybe not that big)...enough to feed the whole Irish army, for a few Euro. Love it.  Compare that to Budapest where - though exquisitely beautiful in its architecture - we were constantly being hustled.  haha I'm reliving the trip excited planning our next trip in April and unleashing it on you.  That's super interesting about the hitchiking, I had no idea but it really makes sense given what little I know about the history and people.  Alright I'll stop before I go completely fangirl over your country or maybe it's too late! I know it's very different visiting than living and of course there are many challenges with the economy and all but...I still love it."

They're only preparing themselves for the real world and will be ready to face it when the time comes.

If you’ve ever heard “excuse me, but would it be possible if I could maybe just a little bit…”, you know what I’m talking about. Poles get to the point faster. I don’t think it’s a problem but sometimes it can be uncomfortable in situations like e.g. I get a text that just says “ok”. With Americans, if you send a message like that, you know someone is pissed. It should be more like, “ok sure no problem”. That’s us agreeing not once, but 3 times for good measure. In Poland, they’re just agreeing. Once is enough I guess? This also proves our tendency to exaggerate. Nothing is good, everything is great/fantastic/spectacular. In Poland, ok means just that. In our house we regularly ask each other, “Polish ok or American ok?” Meaning, it is good (Polish ok) or just eh (American ok). Meaning the statement, “you look ok”, can have two quite different meanings depending on which of us says it.  &gt;More: http://polonization.pl/are-we-so-different-poles-vs-americans/  &gt; Fascinating.

"&gt;Information and technique cannot be passed on genetically  That's totally true, but also irrelevant to the point I was trying to make.  &gt;someone with a good education will still demolish less-educated ""naturals"".   I wasn't comparing people with different levels of education. I was comparing the amounts of time and effort required for two different people to reach the same level of education (and pointing out that for some people certain levels of education are impossible).  &gt;""learning ability"" is 98% your attitude to it, nurture not nature  There is certainly a ""nurture"" component in addition to ""nature,"" but from the science I've seen on the subject you have their influences flipped. The studies I've seen have shown that nurture only really has an effect if the environment is abysmal (i.e. a child growing up in a horrible environment will perform poorly, but for everyone in relatively stable situations the effect of parenting on intelligence is minimal to nonexistent).  However, that's irrelevant since it doesn't matter if the advantage comes from nature or nurture: some people just learn more quickly than others regardless of relative enthusiasm. I've worked as an educator in the past, and I've seen students with intense drive and enthusiasm struggle while some of their peers breeze through. In fact, I've found that the students who are the fastest learners actually tend to be more disinterested and put in little effort while still outperforming their peers. They've learned that they don't have to try in order to meet expectations. There are always those who have a combination of intelligence and drive, of course; they often go far in life.  &gt;I did pretty average and fell behind what I expected myself to do because I didn't do much work, but as soon as I got interested in maths again my grade shot up. In contrast, when I was interested in French language I picked it up at a reasonable pace, but as soon as I got bored I was barely able to learn anything.  The flaw in your examples is that they only involve your personal experience. *Of course* you learn faster and perform better for subjects that you are interested in, but that's based solely on a sample size of *you*.

I used to always be up into everyone's business, inviting them to share, ""do you want to talk about it?"" even pressuring when they didn't feel like it. After all, I believed, if you talk about it, you'll feel better. Truth is, people need to be able to control who they discuss their problems with and choose their own time for if/when they discuss it with others, and the last thing they need is some asshole encouraging them to ""open up."" Get off their backs! If they're not sharing their problems with you, assume there's a damn good reason and let it go. If they need you, they will find you.   &gt;(Another truth is, learned this from a psychologist, sometimes people just need to stop talking about their problems and move on with their life. Not everything has closure. You don't make peace with every tragedy. Happiness is not waiting for you *if only* you can come to terms with your childhood or some tragedy. Some mental wounds are like physical wounds. If you keep picking at the scab, it will never heal. Time heals most things, but you have to let it.)

His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront.""...""The man's crime is different from other crimes -- for it makes even crimes impossible."""

Not Scandinavian good, but good nonetheless. And IIRC, it was British English and not American English.

His family never taught him that it was a special situation for a while until they get on their feet. Nothing. He thought that EVERYONE when they turned 18 got their food stamps. He thought the goverment paid for everybody's food.   Well, he ended up realizing and he was hard working and his family and daughter I worked with were decently well off.   But she made me look at it another way. And while I'm still upset about it, I consider the system that is set up in a way to allow such absue. I look at the education these individuals were given. Maybe some of them truly dont' know any better. It changed the way I looked at what I considered to be the problem.

"The funny thing about art. Natural talent only takes you so far if you don't use it and study it and nuture it. I was, by all accounts, the artist of my high school. Well, the female one anyway. There was a boy who beat me out. But I was up there. My whole life. I saw these people around me have work that was nowhere near the skill level of mine. That I put no effort into!   Well, I didn't study art in college and it all fell by the way side. I still have some raw talent. But I just don't know how to utilize it anymore.   Meanwhile the kids around me who's work was nowhere near as good as mine all studied art in college. They all have jobs of one degree or another in the art field. Their skills have surpassed mine. Even with art, there is an element of ""practice makes perfect."" Natural ability helps, but if you don't work at it, you'll get nowhere.

If you've got a year or two of the language under your belt though, by all means go ahead. If you've spent a month or two learning some words and phrases though, I wouldn't. Just my thoughts."
"Not me, but one of my best friends. He would tell me how when he was a kid he was kind of racist and it was only because of the X-Men comics that he understood that discriminating others for being different wasn't right. Btw, he's got now a career as a comic book illustrator."

"We were under the Swedish rule for 600 years (give or take a century) and it just stuck. There's also the Swedish-speaking minority (about 5% of the population) who have the right to deal with official things in their own language.  I personally feel like it's a stupid policy, since while there are some Swedish-speaking municipalities along the coastline, not everyone lives there. Giving the kids a choice between Swedish and Russian (maybe one of the Sami dialects as well), would be more useful - especially in the eastern parts where there's much less Swedes and more Russians."

"Someone told me this koan:  ""There existed a farmer in a small village in China.   One day, his horse ran away. The villagers bemoaned, ""Woe is you! Your horse ran away! How will you plow your fields? How will you get ready for winter? What bad fortune!"" The man replied, ""Good fortune, bad fortune, who knows?"" and walked away.  The next day, his wild horse came back with 3 wild horsey friends! The villagers were overjoyed, ""How amazing! Your horse brought back so many friends! You will surely have enough help to plow and till your field. What good fortune!"" The man replied, ""Good fortune, bad fortune, who knows?"" and walked away.  Later that day, while trying to break in the three new horses, the farmer's son fell of a horse and broke his leg. The villagers bemoaned, ""Woe is you! Your only son has broken his leg! How will you plow your field with no one to tend to your horses? What bad fortune!"" The man replied, ""Good fortune, bad fortune, who knows?"" and walked away.  The next day, the army came to town and conscripted all the able-bodied young men into the army. Except the farmer's son couldn't go because of his broken leg.  And on life goes. ""  That story changed my entire perspective that there exists no good or bad in the world at all.

"I worked for an Indian translation company for a while, and am frankly in awe of the way some of those people translated legal documents and contracts from other languages into English, which was itself often a second (or more likely third) language for them.

I don't think I'll ever forget the look in her eyes when she told me I had a beautiful smile.

"In some sports height or body composition will be a factor, but in this case it matters less than you think.

I think the average height for sprinters nowadays is about 5'9""-5'10"". Shorter people are usually better at distance running, rather than sprinting. There are other sports where being short or tall matter more, like jockeying or basketball. But there are also many sports where it does not especially matter, like golf, weight-lifting, gymnastics, soccer, or moto racing. Practice usually matters more.  EDIT: If the topic interests you, there's a book called The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle, that goes more in depth about the factors that matter and the type of practice necessary for mastery."

"Not me, but my dad. My dad is a very smart and caring man but he wasn't very comfortable with what was first happening with gays and their involvement in the church (he wasn't necessarily against anything but didn't quite know how to feel or what to think). When a Bishop stopped in to do a Q &amp; A at our church, my dad jumped at the chance to hear what the heads of our church had to say about the matter. That's when he heard this, ""God didn't allow you to pick your parents, not your brothers or your sisters. You can't pick your aunts or uncles. But, He has given you the choice of picking the person you want to love and share your life with. That is significant. If He wanted us to love a certain person, He would've picked them for us. He didn't, it's your choice."" Since then whenever the topic of gay marriage, gay rights, etc. comes up, my dad references what the Bishop said and hopefully changes someone else's way of thinking too."

"I know that generally the burden of proof rests with the person who makes a claim, but for ancient history, you kind of have to take the sources as they come.  There certainly was a movement called Christianity that got kind of a slow start.  By the first century AD it was in full swing, with the emperor making serious efforts to stamp it out.  The passage in Tacitus was written a while after Jesus' birth, but that is not uncommon with ancient historians.  It's also important to realize that just because we don't have an ancient text doesn't mean it didn't exist.  When there's a long gap between an event and the first mention we have of it, that probably means that other historians wrote about it in the interim, but that work did not survive.  More to the point, there is no reason Tacitus would lie.  He has no dog in that fight.  He doesn't really like Christians, I guess, but in his time Christianity was not a major threat.    About why it matters, first of all, the bible doesn't say that the earth is 6000 years old.  That is an interpretation that some people get from assuming that the bible is a literate and accurate recitation of history when obviously it leaves a lot of stuff out.  Also, I bet if you told Christians ""A guy named Jesus wasn't crucified, it was a different rabbi with those teachings"" they wouldn't care.  The important part is that SOMEONE had those ideas and was crucified about it, and honestly, the Romans were crucifying people left and right in Judaea at the time, it was very mismanaged."
"So, I'm sure some people actually think their bones are bigger (and some people have bigger bones - hence taller people - but it makes up for a ridiculously minimal amount of weight. We're talking in the low single digits.) But it's a mindset people get when someone's been fat as long as they can remember.   I have a cousin that is 6'5"", 340 pounds, played DT in college football. That dude was big since the day he was born. And always overweight. But because of his stature, people say he's big boned, even though he could lose 150 pounds in fat.   Big (tall) dudes in general typically get the 'big boned' moniker, just because when you're 6'+ and overweight, you just have an overall large quality to you. You don't usually see someone referred to as big boned when they're 5'7"". Same thing for women, but the heights shift down a bit.  Anyhow, people hear themselves get called that long enough (like me), and they just start to believe that they were just born big (like me) and there is no point in fighting it."

"No. I just ezperienced a slightly slower onset, and a fainting problem meant I wasnt diagnosed until I was almost dead. My doctor thinks I may have had LADA for a while... however, type 1 can develop in jumps and starts for some people. My insulin resistance is really good, on account of several active hobbies.  If you need to fast to stay below 90, youre 100% developing insulin resistance, and will progress to a nasty state if you dont start to fix the cause now. Its extremely likely youre ecperiencing highs above 135, which are causing uour B depletion. You should be below 90, preferrably 80, for most of the day, regardless of your diet. Get a meter and a few hundred strips, youre only talking $60, all in, and you could save yourself from a very serious disease. You may even be developing type 1 or LADA if your fasting isnt below 80.  Edit: 100 lbs? Are you anorexic, or just tiny? Sounds like you have a serious eating disorder, which is not going ro help any vitamin deficiencies. Seriously, get your bloods checked, as extreme weight loss can be a symptom of LADA, and even MODY."

"I attended a private school, but I've also seen what happens in countries without public school- a lot of people don't get an education.   I would define rich people for these purposes as anyone who makes more than maybe 35k a year- at that point, people have enough money to give back.  More than 70k a year doesn't contribute any extra to your happiness, so at the very least I would set the limit there.  I don't think rich people are greedy and heartless, I think everyone tends to be greedy and heartless.  The fact of the matter is that people aren't wired to care about people they can't see and don't know.  I don't think people are going to give in a consistent way and give to the correct places to keep things like free healthcare for poor people in place.  There's also an example of what happens when there's not a federal effort to keep up roads, etc. in Ancient Rome.  Rich people built those things because it was glorious and got them acclaim and helped them get into office, but nobody repaired anything, because that didn't help their ambition.  The result was that everything was constantly in disrepair.  I also do believe it's ok to take things from people under certain circumstances.  You have to rank rights.  One person's right to stay alive trumps someone else's right to do whatever they want.  For instance, religious freedom is good, but human sacrifice should still be illegal.  Likewise, it's more important for somebody with medicaid to get their life-saving chemotherapy than for someone to keep money they don't need to survive.  If you think it's a waste of time to talk to me, that's fine, though.  I have long ago realized that there is usually no arguing with objectivists."
"This reminds me of went someone starts coughing during dinner at my parents because something went down wrong.   My dad always says he'll worry once we stop coughing, because then we can either answer that were fine or it'll be time for him to actually do something about it."
"My father once said to me (I'll paraphrase it) : ""There are 3 things that a person should acomplish in a lifetime, and which he should be fond of having succesfully obtained. One is widsom, being intelectually rich. Other is honor, to be proud of what you are, what you love, what you do, and defend it until your last drop of blood is shed. And finally and most importantly, spirituallity; be driven by your spirit, by your belief and always question it and search for your inner self.""  I took those values and I've tried to communicate the importance of such; my father is a very wise man who got fucked by bad judgement and retaliated from bad people who tried to screw him over. Other importance value is to be humble, which he added up later, but it was not on the main phrase itself.  Be humble, be honourfull, be a strong spirit, be wise.   J. Matti"

"I hated this one. Mum used to say it all the time. I grew up thinking i was a very unlikable person and tried very hard to hide myself. Until just recently I always had this fear that if someone got to know the ""real me"" they would realise how boring and useless i was. Please dont tell your kids this unless they've actually down something awful. It can be damaging if said all the time for trivial reasons"
"Thanks, I'm trying to work on it, though normal seems so natural to others, it's not easy but it's worth it to have real friendships. How did you overcome it?"
"They were. Now back to the original point: ENGLISH is there as a language, not going away soon."
"I was in middle school, maybe 4th or 5th grade, and I was..problematic. I was in a Special Ed for behavioral problems which they originally chalked up to ADHD though it wasn't until high school that I was officially diagnosed with Asperger's. I was very volatile and became very antagonistic and even violently towards teachers and classmates. I recall off the top of my head that I've screamed in one person's ear, took a kid to the ground by leaping on his back (in my defense, it was playful but looking back it was undoubtedly frightening for him because it came out of nowhere).   So I was having serious issues at school when it came to treating others nastily and feeling justified, even in that split second when I did that shit. One day my Mum sat me down and successfully conveyed why what I was doing was much worse than what I originally thought.  ""Do you know how it makes people feel when you tell people to shut up when they speak to you?""  ""Yeah but--""  ""Shut up, Talyn.""  ""I-""  ""Shut up.""  In that moment I felt overwhelming sense of anger, dismay, and sadness. Empathy, or at least the concept of it, finally clicked in. I still have troubles applying it to real life sometimes as a college-age student but in theory it's helped me understand history and sociology so much more. My Mum mirroring my behavior right then and there has thus far been her most successful teaching tool, though she undoubtedly is unaware of it because I still did a few dumb things in late middle school up until Junior year in high school. But the principle was established. Some kids with varying degrees of autism never quite 'get it' nor do they ever feel like it's necessary, and it makes people like me who want to get along with others look bad."
Ive struggled too. I always thought i was boring and unlikable. It took me a while but ive realised the biggest thing decent people care about in other peoples personality is how nice they are. So if you are a good nice person then who cares? And if you find yourself surrounded by other good nice people then its a pretty good sign that you yourself are that way cause other wise they wouldnt want to hang out with you. :)
"Interesting - I didn't actually know anything about Poland, just was going off what the person I replied to said. And I totally buy that high context communication is more efficient. Everyone else replying to this is saying they would prefer the more direct response, but I actually prefer the high context. Between Argentina and Japan, I was so much more comfortable with the people in Japan, even if I was a bit self-conscious about being rude through ignorance. It's so much nicer, for instance, if you don't want to do something, to be able to just express a little reluctance and have someone understand and politely accept rather than having to point-blank refuse and really feel like you're being rude. High context all the way for me."

"I live in Italy. I have no choice whether or not I *want* to learn Italian. I *have* to learn Italian. I have a year under my belt. I would consider myself conversational but I was trying to be modest.   &gt; 90% of the time we're more fluent in English than you are in whatever you're trying to speak  I didn't really think you were rude until this sentence. This is simply untrue. I live in the most international city in Italy and just after 6 months my Italian become a more effective way to communicate than English, for everything. 50% of the population in Italy don't know a single word of English. France and Italy are notorious for being proud of their culture and refusing to learn English. (whether this is intentional or subconscious I don't know) I don't know where you grew up but it's very possible that the majority were bilingual. That's good. Most northern European countries speak English as well. It just doesn't apply everywhere. Especially around the Mediterranean.   &gt; If you've got a year or two of the language under your belt though, by all means go ahead.  Thanks?  I worked in retail for years and *it is* frustrating not having people speak your language but to me there is a minimal level of patience and respect people should be given. That should apply no matter the circumstances. That's just good customer service."
Thank you!
"I was reading a political debate, typical liberal vs conservative stuff on social policies, and someone was going off on how we need programs for this and that.   One guy responded: ""Well, what do YOU do to help in your community?  Do you donate to food pantries, or chip in a few bucks to a worthy program?  Or do you just ask others to do it?""  The question if we need those programs or not is beyond the purview of this, but I thought the other guy made a good point.  Sure, we make a fine social net, but whatever helping people on our own as well?  Do we try to volunteer in the community, give to charity, or drop off a bag of groceries at the food pantry from time to time?"
"I read someone somewhere, it may have been in an article or someone describing the concept of privilege in a reddit comment, but it was very effective.  It's like if you're running a foot race, against a person with one leg. Winning that race doesn't mean you are a better athlete than your competitor. It doesn't mean you didn't train hard and work your ass off, but you have to acknowledge that maybe having two legs helped you out a little bit. And if the person with one leg gets a prosthetic next race and beats you, it doesn't mean he gets an unfair advantage."

"Well it sounds more accurate now but the accent is still there :). Really impressed that you learned all that yourself!   The fika thing was mostly a joke but yes we go out just to eat something sweet like a cinnamon bun or a a bit of cake, drink coffee and talk to friends. If you for example wanna take out a girl then fika is a good option. If your inviting someone over its almost mandatory to brew up some coffee.    We have alot of coffee breaks at work and usally someone brings pastries aswell. We drink ALOT of coffee."

"I took a good look at myself and looked at all of my weaknesses. I didn't know how to take proper care of myself or my environment, didn't know how to handle confrontation, didn't know how or when to appropriately express myself; I honestly don't know how I got through some of my younger years.   Start at the beginning. Read parenting articles about how best to cope with overwhelming emotions and parent yourself. Fill in whatever gaps you may have in your knowledge about how to handle yourself. What makes you angry? What calms you down? What do you need to do when you get so overwhelmed that you have a panic attack? How do you prevent the next one?  Honestly though, find someone or a group of people you can talk to about this. I cannot recommend enough /r/survivorsofabuse  and /r/abuseinterrupted. Remember to be kind to yourself when you make a mistake. It's more important to learn why you failed so you can apply that knowledge to the next attempt, and it's not as important that you failed. It's okay. Shit happens but your future self needs this experience in order to be better."

It hit me hard that such a cheerful and positive teacher would say something like this, but I believed him and so far what he said has turned out to be true. Cold words, but true.

I learned that lesson and I'm glad I did, life is much better.   However I still feel like I am nothing which is how I feel but I can hold down a better job than most people like me, have incredible morals and values. I can't accept myself as being a good friend like they say I just feel like that's too cocky. But I don't know what else to feel or how I should, its hard to think positively about myself, but that may be from psychological abuse from my parents and not being able to trust people that I should be able to trust, ie therapists.   My therapist told my parents everything and got my friend fucked by police. He had nothing to do with me I was just reminiscing on a story. Idk how so you deal with it?

"A few years ago we had a guest speaker at our school. It was GB Tran, author of the graphic novel Vietnamerica which is about his parents lives escaping Vietnam and his family history. He was talking about how he never wanted to hear about it or visit Vietnam when he was younger, but when he went when he was older he was inspired to write the book. Someone asked him if he regrets not going earlier and he said that no, he doesn't, because if he had went earlier then he wouldn't have been inspired to write the book because of where he had been in his life.     He said that everything happens *when it happens* for a reason. Now I've grown up in the south, surrounded by religious people, so I've heard ""Everything happens for a reason"" my whole life and always thought it was crap. But the more I thought about what this dude had said the more I realized how true it was. Everything happens exactly when it's supposed to, both good and bad. There's no use wishing for different timing because this is the only time that we have.     Like, I could sit here and wish I'd made a move on my current boyfriend back when I met him four years ago, but it won't change anything. and even if I did we wouldn't have got together because we were such different people then. Everything happens at the right time it's supposed to happen, and realizing that has changed my life. Same with the death of my grandmother - sure, it would be nice if she was still here but she'd just be in more pain. It was best she passed when she did, no matter how much it hurt me.     I know the philosophy isn't for everyone, but it works for me."

"I don't pay incredibly large attention to quality since I rarely cook for myself, but it's usually water with the oatmeal. Bacon 5 or 6 slices or just one slice of ham. But yeah I'd have to to a whole journal or something to figure that out.   Also why wouldn't my boyfriend and I be around the same size rather than the size of our families? Our families ate very differently and we now eat a mixture of the two, but we always eat the same amount and split our food by half at home or wherever we go.  That makes sense, about the aging bit.  I'm not being incredulous, by the way, this is genuine curiosity about a subject I don't know much about beyond light reading and school."

Older students like myself are more serious about actually learning so I am sure that has a lot to do with it. Some of the younger people in my classes will whine about not liking a teacher because of what all they expect out of the students in the class. These teachers though I find are usually some of the best because as long as you clearly know what the teachers expectations are you have no excuses for not passing their class.
"Yessir, I agree. That's exactly why nobody knows about it. A papal epistle acts pretty much like an update or revision to the bible, yet nobody seems to recognize that they even exist.

"In 6th grade, I recall interrupting two of my teachers while they were having a conversation to ask a question (that was time sensitive actually, but alas) and the one that ended up being of my favorite teachers of all time chided me and told me I should never interrupt two people speaking to each other.   Because of this, I'm always careful to wait until a conversation is over or at the very least apologize for interrupting before I interrupt."

"Again, fat people get it a lot more often but it happens behind their backs. Skinny people are told to their faces to gain weight and ""eat a burger"" and ""you're so skinny!""

Atheist propaganda?  I don't believe in magic. I don't care if you do. I was just making a statement from my own perspective.  If yours differs - great. I hope it brings you peace.    I lost faith in that crap from reading the books - maybe you've never read the books and prefer to just accept what's in your gut. That doesn't work for me.  I can't just accept a fiction that makes me feel good.   But in any case - have a wonderful and joyous life.
"Almost no one will see this now but I wanted to throw in my two cents. This happened fairy recently but honestly it blew my mind.  So left a long term relationship and a bit after I worked up the courage to ask out a friend of mine. To my surprise she said yes and we proceeded to have an awesome date but about halfway through I was starting to realize that she didn't think this was a date. I think she thought this way because she didn't think I was single.  We were still having fun and bringing up the awkward details of why I was single and haven't told her yet would kind of derail the night. Although, because of this there definitely were some awkward moments.   After that night in my mind I had no shot really. I felt like if I told her she might think she was a rebound and if I asked her out again without telling her the situation it'd just be weird. I told a buddy of mine the story and he told me to just be straight with her tell her the situation if she's cool with it then that's awesome go on more dates and if she's not then you're in the same position you are now with no date. He then asked me what I had to lose? It took me a mintue to think of something and I said ""my pride?"" Then he replied ""fuck your pride you're  the only one who cares about that""  Now I've heard the phrase ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"" but when he told me if she said No I'd be in the same position I am now it really resonated with me because it's so true and can be applied to so much in life. There's literally 0 risk in doing something that could further yourself because if it fails your in the same position you were if you didn't. Always ask the girl, always apply for whatever you want, always follow your dreams. As for the girl? Ah, She rejected me and I know it won't be the last time I get rejected but I learned so much about myself that I can apply to my life. And besides I only need one yes :)."

"I love that you clearly did not even read the abstract of the paper you linked  &gt;Smoking marijuana can injure mucosal tissue and may have more carcinogenic potential than tobacco. Research has indicated that marijuana intoxication definitely hinders attention, long-term memory storage, and psychomotor skills involved in driving a car or flying a plane. Expectations and past experience with marijuana have often influenced results more than pharmacological aspects have. Marijuana has triggered psychotic episodes in those more vulnerable. Psychological and some instances of physiological dependence on marijuana have been demonstrated.  Also, the article you linked about the effects of marijuana usage on driving clearly states that it *does* impair your driving skills, and people compensate for that by driving much slower and whatnot. It would be very dangerous to try to drive normally while high, and the same is not true of caffeine.  But I'm done with this now, if you truly believe that smoking weed every day is healthy behavior for someone whose work requires them to be alert and high-functioning (like would you rather the firefighters that you called to your house have smoked a bowl that morning or had a cup of coffee), please continue doing so.  I'm just saying, there is an actual reason that people don't show up high for their office job every day."

"I posted this in the thread here, but I'll try and recount it a bit more accurately.  'You don't have to save the world, and that's okay. Sometimes you just have to save one person. What's so bad if that person is you?'  A friend of mine who is alway saying philosophical stuff said that to me. It's made my outlook on life a bit different, knowing that it's okay to try and fix myself before trying to fix the world"

"""Be the change you wish to see."" Pretty sure Gandhi said this, I don't know. I saw it in the video game Life Is Strange and really had to examine myself after that. Hasn't helped that much since then but I try and remember it every time I get into an argument. Another one was:  ""You aren't obligated to be friends with those you consider unintelligent. You aren't creating an echo chamber by refusing to get close to people who are more simple minded than you. You are instead choosing to surround yourself with people who are willing to challenge you and themselves and everyone around you in who they are and what they think. And that, that is the opposite of an echo chamber."" &lt;-- Said by my therapist of all people! She's known me for 5+ years and said that my intelligence is unlike any other patient she's had before, and said I should trust myself in knowing the difference between whether or not I'm building an echo chamber relationship with someone or not, since I'm already smart enough to even consider that a possibility. The important part is to start trusting myself to recognize when it is and isn't happening. That was a worry of mine for a long time and prevented me from reaching out to people I considered extremely smart--way smarter than me--because I feared I was going to become like those who only ever hang out with people like them. I also feared being arrogant but she said that shouldn't be a worry for me since my intellect is apparently my biggest, most extraordinary strength."

"Drugs mostly. Things are very different when you go to a Christian school your whole life. I didn't go to a public school until high school.

I wasn't really afraid till I got to college and started dating my boyfriend. His old group of friends are terrifying. They all have std's they've all been to juvi and a lot of them have kids at a young young age. They are what I think of when I think of atheists. They're the kind of atheists that consider Christians to be uneducated. He doesn't believe in God and I don't care. He's a nice kid. I don't care what people believe, none of my friends are really Christian. I just imagined exactly them when I was young and thought about atheists."

I feel the urge to adventure and explore, not sit in a church and listen to scripture and judge others. I feel I was put on this earth (if by a god) to enjoy my experience of life. Life's not perfect, but you might as well enjoy it while you can. Do some good in your life, and if there is a god, hopefully they see that you are a good person.

"Perhaps he recognized that he had no proof that he was right and decided to then switch the position of not believing until offered evidence.

This is How the burden of proof works"

"My dad told me ""a kid can love his parents a lot, but they will never love their parents as much as a parent loves their kids,"" when he was driving me somewhere.  A little background about my dad: he's an immigrant from Korea, who grew up in a well-off home. His vices from being younger (Koreans tend to drink and smoke very occasionally) eventually caught up with him, health-wise after he moved to the States. His liver was in bad shape, and the medication from this time trashed his kidneys. He was on dialysis for 13 years before finally getting a transplant 2 years ago. He's also had his fair share of losses (one of his brothers died, he got in a fight and lost contact with another brother, another brother left home 4 years ago in Korea and has been MIA since, his sister was raped and murdered 15 years ago, which caused his father to have a stroke and become a cripple).   I think I was...15 or so at the time, and a really mediocre child. I think this really made me change the way I behaved to my parents. Before this, I acted pretty whatever towards my parents, always kind of took them for granted.  Ever since then, I have done my damnedest to show my parents how much I love them, from the occasional spontaneous gifts, to cleaning around the house whenever I'm home (I live 3 hours away for work so I come home rarely). This also really catapulted my development as a person. It made me want to be kind and show more affection to the people I love and actually care for. And it also made me want to love myself, and now I live by the philosophy of being a little better than I was yesterday.  I hope that when I eventually have kids, I could be inspirational to them. Despite my dad being a quiet and reserved person, and not someone I really have a conversation with, he has been the single most inspirational person of my life."

"Except the more you live life, the more you learn that there is nothing called good or evil. Most of the things are shades of grey. Every person thinks of themselves as good with the bad things they do as just exceptions because others do it, you are doing only a little, you just need a bit of help now, you will atone for it later, God will undersntad, no one else knows your life, and a million other reasons  The jailer of Alcatraz famously said that after being with the most deprived of criminals, he has realized that there is nothing a human being, an ordinary human being, will not do if the circumstance were different. So yeah, I don't judge people into good and evil  Even the worst of sociopaths and serial killers have broken brains and some cannot help being who they are."
There is a reason of all these black and white quotes about good vs evil were before we understood the human brains and how human psychology works.

"What do you mean by ""you guys""? I've never heard of anyone making fun of a town named Adolf, partly because I've never heard of a town named Adolf.

"It's true. I don't exactly have a dramatic story, and I've never actually been 'fat', but in my early twenties I went to the beach one day, took off my shirt, and my dad just said 'getting a little pudgy'. I felt pretty embarrassed and conscious about it. Then about a week later, Louis CK was talking about his weight in a comedy special and he made the observation 'you never see fat old people. They're already dead!' I turned, looked at my wife, looked down, and just went 'aww shit'. Since then I've eaten better, drank way more water (both achieved using Lifesum at first to set habits), and done way more exercise. I use the gym every now and again, plus I got a dog and we go for three longish walks a day. I'm now in much better shape, and I did just need to be told. Not bullied, just told."

"&gt;.. You're not really anything in the grand scheme of things ..  Ok so i'm prepared to have my inbox blown up over this but I really don't get this world view. What do you want to be in order to feel like ""something?"" What's the litmus test for human value? I believe everyone is of infinite value, even if it's to someone at some time.  I know people get depressed, commit crimes, and there are thousands of arguments about the life of serial killers not amounting to anything positive but even in darkness, those lives mattered - even they were something. As children they were probably precious to someone.   Like the average human, I've accomplished some relatively cool things, done some pretty bad things (which I'm not proud of), some pretty mediocre or mundane things (usually), and the sum of which which would not result in even a footnote in history. Outside of my immediate family or friends no one would care one way or another what happens to me.   I'll never win a Nobel prize, I won't solve the global food shortage, nor bring about peace in the Middle East. But to my wife and kids and to 2 other people, I've made a huge difference.   I have had 4 opportunities to save lives. So that's my claim to fame (among those I helped). To my secretary and to her family I'm the guy who saved their mom and wife from choking to death on a sour apple jolly rancher. And to the Afghani lady at Coyote Point beach on Father's Day many years ago whom I also saved from choking (on a beef/lamb kabob) I'm a pretty big deal. The toughest one was my 5 year old choking on a piece of tri tip. Panic nearly floored me. Don't ask me why I've been in a position to do the Heimlich 3x on people and 1x on my dog (not really Heimlich but it worked) but it happened. I don't get it but I'm glad it was me. As a coach, I'm glad Heimlich training was mandatory. As a closet nerd, I'm so grateful for being a wealth of useless information (i.e. How to save a dog from choking). If I did nothing else with my life, I made a difference in the lives of a few others. Just my example. I'm sure someone is going to equate having worth with saving a life. That's not what I'm saying (and it was just my example) but feel free to criticize anyway."

"It's not all of them. Parisians sometimes, Quebecois are notorious. But they're both notorious for the same things New Yorkers are. They think they're different than others, or maybe they're sick of tourists, or maybe...  lots of reasons.  Also, English has become defacto among tourists and business people. Many French love their culture and see the language as a big part of it. They even have a summit of French speaking nations every few years to define changes and new words to keep it pure -- like E-Mail was defined to be ""Communication electronique"" so it wouldn't derive from English words.   The rest of France, as well as other French speaking nations (Algeria, Switzerland, Vietnam) all have their own kind of accents, but they don't get snooty about other people's versions if they are understandable. With Parisians, it's probably more like North Eastern Americans automatically thinking someone's a bumpkin if they have a Southern accent. There's still a touch of that regionalism everywhere, even in the English speaking world."

"&gt; I learned the material of English 202 when I was 15 years old.  Then it becomes a matter of actually applying those things, i.e. proving that you did learn them as opposed to just saying you did.  &gt;I also learned a way to cheat through all of my College Algebra homework assignments. I still aced all the tests, probably because I took Calculus I + II in high school.  Why the hell would you need to cheat in college algebra if you've already taken Calculus I and II? Actually, why would you even take that class if you've already taken Calculus I and II?  A big issue here is long-term retention. You may have learned it at some point, but if you can't remember it all, then did you really learn it? If you *did*, then it should be very little effort to do well in things you've already learned, busywork at worst."

"Your village looks really beautiful. It reminds me of Cassis a little bit from the wiki photo. We wanted to go to Normandy on this road trip but in the end we decided it's a little to cold in the off-season (and pretty far). Maybe in the Spring or Summer.   How's the winter there?   No problem at all! I can understand where you get the frustration. Frankly, sometimes I'm embarrassed by the behavior of Americans I see visiting Italy too. We're very loud but in a weird way where we talk like everyone is listening. It's just we're very culturally different. Surprisingly I think we're more similar to French.

"Oh man, I fucking love talking about engineering. Here is a link to a video of me getting the hand of my robot arm to work; I even got individual finger control. (You control it by wearing a glove, and it works wirelessly.)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwzIc2SmqHY&amp;feature=youtu.be  Also, I can link you to a video of a slouch sensor that me and two other engineers worked on as well. It's a wearable sensor that detects your slouching in real time and sends it wirelessly to a phone app that beeps at you when you slouch. You can set the level of slouch detection if you want. That one was real fun to design and code! Ha! It's just one example of the many infinitude of things one can work on when it comes to engineering. The best part is we came up with the entire idea ourselves, and since we were all seniors, had the capability and know-how to actually create it; that was definitely a very rewarding experience."

I was terrified of spending a year away from my family and friends in one of the poorest countries on earth, and was seriously considering turning it down.

"Years ago, I fell ass-backwards into editing, and I could tell that I upset a few people who asked me what sort of qualifications I needed, what courses I took, etc., and I answered, ""Well, none. I just kind of instinctively knew how to do it."" Now, I fully realize that the reason I knew how to do it was that I was a voracious reader since childhood, and therefore learned many of the intricacies of the English language through unconscious osmosis, but since 95% of that reading was for pleasure, there's no way I'd classify it as ""hard work"". That said, I fucking hated editing."
"&gt; ""What’s comin’ will come, and we’ll meet it when it does.""  This is a simple quote from Hagrid, of the Harry Potter series if you didn't know. I grew up reading these books, from the time I was 9 i started reading the first couple, then revisited and finished the series when I was a teenager. I was also the exact age as the characters as the movies were released, so I've always felt a connection with the core characters, like I grew up with them and could relate in a comfortable and familiar way. (and there were strange parallels like my best friend also being a ginger lol)  Hagrid was one of the adult figures that always had a pragmatic approach to life; no bullshit, give me the skinny, matter of fact guy. I loved that about him. Especially in the years where I started to notice, more and more, my own flaws as well as the people around me. I've re-thought and repeated this quote a thousand times and I definitely feel it has dug itself into my way of thinking, for the better."

I don't remember specifically what they said to me but it was something around the lines of, you're sort of being an asshole to us. I was, and still am, the kind of person who would tease my friends and what I didn't realize back then was that I didn't respect their boundaries when it came to teasing. It really hit me hard because I didn't know that I was hurting my friends when in reality I was just joking around. Because of that, I am now always mindful of what I say around people and luckily, those friends are still my BFFs to this day :)"

Look into actuarial science.
"Driving on the left side (the way that Britain, Japan, Australia, India etc do it) is actually statistically safer. The reason is because in the overall population there is a tendency towards right eye dominance so people have stronger awareness in that side of their vision.  So technically if there is a ""right"" side, it's to drive on the left.  Edit: relevant quote from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic#Safety_aspects  &gt; In left-hand traffic, the predominantly better-performing right eye is used to monitor oncoming traffic and the driver's wing mirror (side mirror). In right-hand traffic, oncoming traffic and the driver's wing mirror are handled by the predominantly weaker left eye. In addition, it has been argued that left-sided driving is safer for elderly people given the likelihood of their having visual attention deficits on the left side and the need at intersections to watch out for vehicles approaching on the nearside lane. Furthermore, in an RHD car with manual transmission, the driver has the right hand, which for most people is dominant, on the steering wheel at all times and uses the left hand (and left foot) to change gears and operate most other controls.  &gt; Cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders typically mount from the left-hand side, with motorcycle side stands almost always located on the left. This places them on the kerb when driving on the left."

"I've found that the opposite is true. I mean, *of course*, losing your morality helps, but there's a difference between losing it and acting immorally 99% of the time. In general the ideal strategy is to be good when people are looking and bad when people aren't, the catch is that nowadays everybody is looking (thanks, internet). So, unless you're so incompetent that you don't know how to make money by generating value and gaining reputation along the way (as opposed to distorting or destroying it), you'll want to act good 99% of the time. And that means paying employees fairly, being honest with your deals, providing good customer service, etc. The times where you absolutely needed to do wrong to make the most money are over, you can still do that, but it's far more efficient in most cases to be pragmatically good over being pragmatic no matter what.

"You make it sound like there is nothing you can do... You say that heroin addicts or alcoholics have ways they can get help... but food addicts don't?  Look up stories or articles about people who had a food addiction and overcame it. Figure out what they did and how you can make it work for you. Find people to help you through it.

"As a child, I don't remember ever being bullied or mocked over my stutter - classmates and siblings alike just ignored it - but I was extremely self-conscious about it. For most of my childhood, I was very purposeful and measured with my speech, trying to make it better.   Something I read (about 11 or 12) that I've always carried with me was from Robert J. Sawyer's *Far Seer*, ""Fear is the counselor.""   I try to listen to my fears, yet let logic and experience mold my actions. You need to listen to, and really *hear* what the fear has to say, in order to figure out if A) it's reasonable or not; B) what the long- and short-term results of action AND inaction would be in the situation; and C) how cautiously you should go about with what you decide to do.  I got out of catholic school and went to the local high school for junior and senior year. At that point I said, ""Fuck it, I'm going to challenge myself and overcome this!"" I joined the Future Business Leaders of America, competed and placed 2nd at the state level for Impromptu Speech...both years! As a senior, I was elected by the club to be Vice President of Competitions. I had to present to to the entire 200+ member club at nearly every meeting.  It was only during my freshman year of college that I read a phrase that has truly changed my life: I was reading about the history of neo-Paganism in the 20th century, and stumbled across the definition of the term, ""Magick."" I believe it was Aleister Crowley (it may have been Gerald Gardner or Raymond Buckland though) who said, ""Magick is making what you want to happen, happen.""   It slowly damned on me that the many challenges I have faced since becoming an adultare not always impossible obstacles. If I want something to happen, I can make it happen...and all I have to do is make it happen!"
"I totally agree! I acknowledge rich Western privilege and pretty privilege and able-bodied privilege and right-handed privilege and all of the other things that got me a few steps forward in life. I don't understand what is up with people who get so defensive when someone lets them know they had a privilege.   It doesn't mean I'll definitely be successful, just that more opportunities for success have come my way because of all of the various privileges I have. It's up to me to make something of those opportunities, and not spend everything I've got on hookers and blow or whatever, but there is SO much luck involved and I'm incredibly grateful."

"I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but I'll give you some citations:  1) [Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9549239)  ""Studies of twins reared together and studies of unrelated individuals reared together yield sizable estimates of common family environmental influence in childhood but also demonstrate that **this influence dissipates with age and approaches zero in adulthood**.""  2) [Freakonomics - The Economist Guide to Parenting](http://freakonomics.com/2011/06/07/the-economist-guide-to-parenting-full-transcript/)  I recommend reading or listening to this whole thing. They interview researchers who found that childhood environment has minimal effect on test scores and performance. Here's a good quote:  ""**What matters most is who parents are; not what they do**. Following all the culture-cramming advice in a parenting book? Won’t have much effect. But: the kind of parents who are likely to buy parenting books and do all that culture cramming are high-achieving parents to start with, and **those are the qualities — high IQ, good health, determination, and so on — that their kids inherit**.""  3) [Science - Genes don't just influence your IQ—they determine how well you do in school](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/10/genes-dont-just-influence-your-iq-they-determine-how-well-you-do-school)  ""In all, about 62% of the individual differences in academic achievement—at least when it came to GCSE scores—could be attributed to genetic factors""  4) [The high heritability of educational achievement reflects many genetically influenced traits, not just intelligence](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/42/15273)  This is the study referenced by article 3.  The only studies I've seen that show a strong influence of nurture are those comparing vastly different economic and social situations. So it definitely can be an influence, though it appears to be so only in situations where opportunity or even basic nutrition are sorely lacking. As long as people are given equal access to basic resources, genetics seems to dominate."

"I didn't know medical marijuana was legal there! It's exceedingly hard to find as I require it also. I did find some, it was around 15 euro per gram but did the trick though it was boarderline ditch weed.  Yes the internet is awesome, way better than Ireland too. You can apparently get like 3 mobiles and TV and internet for 35 quid or something like that.  It looks like derivatives of Marijuana are legal, not marijuana itself, and only for certain conditions. Sweet I love having epilepsy haha but in truth I use it for anxiety and such as well, epilepsy (I've had a few seizures of unknown etiology so I classify as having it) comes in handy as a 'valid' reason.  Usually it's the college age kids who know where to get it, as with everywhere in the world.  Here's some sites I use for cheap travel: -Skyscanner -Momondo (cheap flights) -BlaBla car (like uber but between cities) -AirBnB (I'm sure you've heard of it, if you get an invite you get 20 quid off your first stay as does the person who invites you so if you don't have an account I'd obviously be happy to send you an invite, or you can just sign up on your own). -Trusted housesitters.com (same invite situation, it's a pay to join site but for us it was worth it as we spent 10 days in the Hague in a lovely place by the beach for free in exchange for sitting 2 doggies) -Rome2Rio (gives you all the options for travel between 2 destinations) -Couchsurfing.com (stay with random people for the craic)   And RyanAir has retardedly cheap flights, I have flown from Dublin to Amsterdam, Portugal, Bucharest and Krakow for 10-35 euro per flight. Just PRINT YOUR BOARDING PASS AND CHECK IN ONLINE or you'll get hit with fees more than your ticket is worth.  Bon voyage, feel free to pick my brain as I am always happy to help another budget traveler out."
"I get into so much trouble with my wife, when I txt or answer in a curt fashion that is from my upbringing by family on both sides who were only 1 generation removed from moving to the USA from Europe. I have noticed a tendency to be more direct than most people I know. Now I know why. Funny."

Were you actually insinuating that I think less of Obama because I didn't use his first name? You do realize that I don't really have to specify which Obama because there is only one of consequence in modern American political life. On the other hand, there are at least 3 famous Bush's, so specifying which one helps make the writing clear (something you no absolutely nothing about)."

I can't help but feel the same way. It seems incredibly more selfish to expect someone to suffer for a lifetime just to spare yourself from grieving for a few weeks.
The problem is when the people have more seniority and you have to actively convince them that peer review is even a good idea rather than an annoying hurdle. Left my last job because it was far too tiring trying to constantly convince people of good development practice :-(

"1st, to clear up a misunderstanding, I have no idea if you mentioned Obama or Bush in your post. I just noticed myself writing George Bush, rather than Bush, and Obama rather than Barrack Obama, when I referred to them, and made a note of it. I guess there are some real shitty people around so that's not a totally ununderstandable interpretation.  2nd, re: verbal pleasantries:  Wow medical journals. Nice. You must be wicked smart!  Shakespeare? He's notoriously impenetrable, well done.  Can you tie your own shoelaces too?  But really, you don't need to explain not following someone's post. It's not a big deal. I'm sure if you pored over it obsessively you'd decipher it, but I'm guessing you're not that interested, and that's probably just as it should be.  &amp;nbsp;  What I'm talking about is a waste of time?  Oh ok. Case closed.  What am I to do with the empty space left by the understanding and conclusions I'm going to be throwing out? Perhaps join a church to fill the void. That might be fun.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, no I didn't mean you hate your glorious muslim (joke!) president, and its a sad world that you even have to wonder if I did.

I have no idea what was funny about what I said. German-speaking people seem to find some strange hilarity in words like 'leader' or names of towns/cities that have 'Adolf' in them that I don't really understand.
"Very true. I was learning Finnish, and I chose it since there are no genders which troubles me.

"I had that realization after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMJTi-FiDvA) where this guy goes off on a bit of a tangent about how he got into tech repair. The video is a bit long, so I'll summarize the story:  When he was in school, he knew a girl who treated him nicely for no reason, and it turned out that she was being abused by her father, so he decided in his adolescent mind that he was going to raise enough money to allow her to move out of her house for a while. He started with washing bikes, but that didn't go far, and eventually a friend convinced him to start modding PS3s to play pirated games, and that made him enough money to eventually let the girl live in a hotel for a while; they even managed to get the guy arrested.  While you may change the world for the better more obviously by ending a war, or curing cancer, even computer repair can make a difference in someone's life for the better. Sadly the story ended with the girl sending a suicide note to him years later talking about her guilt for having accepted the money and returning the money he had given her before, but I think that helping someone a little bit through a hard time still really makes a difference, even if it's facilitated by something as mundane as modding other kids' PS3s.  Sorry about the writing, I'm writing this a bit late, but I thought I should share this."

"Just out of curiosity, what subject did you study?  I'm asking because there's a lot of STEM / CompSci students on Reddit; I'm one of them. It's hard. People pop pills, drown themselves in booze, just to get through. Some do it so that they don't fail. Some do it because they need certain grades in order to accomplish their goals. Some do it because society expects them to. I doubt anyone does it just because they felt like it; like someone said, nobody does anything they think is evil on purpose.  So, I ask you: what's better for the soul? Doing what you can to survive in the environment you are put in, or seeing your dreams slip away?  In regard to what your father said: I don't think he meant you should never cheat. I think he meant that you shouldn't go through your entire life as a cheater.

"This is pretty universal among positions.  I remember an executive meeting where one particularly opinionated exec stated a very strong stance on a relatively minor topic (JIRA organization - small, but quite meaningful). It was obvious that *none* in the room agreed with him, but everyone just eyed each other hoping that someone else would try and explain to him why he was wrong.  After a rather awkward 10s pause, I made the decision to fire him and ""agreed"" to his suggestion.  (Obviously, a lot had built up to this, but the fact that NONE of his peers were willing to deal with trying to discuss things with him was a pretty obvious sign that things had gotten way past repair)"

"Accepting friends for who they are is great when who they are is positive, constructive, and enriching to the lives of those around them. Not so much when they are getting you into trouble or making you a worse person.  I am constantly trying to change my friends the same way I am trying to change myself. Human development ought to be a constant pursuit of personal perfection. It takes a *lot* to get me to give up on someone, but it is possible. It's not about ""If I can't make you want I want, I'm going to ditch you.""   And what if it was? If there is something about someone that I find to be abhorrent--say they're horribly racist, for example--and no matter what I say to them, I cannot get them to change their ways? If I fear this person is going to drag me down and make me worse than I am, and they have shown no desire to be a better person, why should I not cut ties with them? The alternative is to continue to associate with them and be influenced by their behavior.  It is no great sin to part ways with a friend because of irreconcilable differences."

"Yup, I do the same, just word it differently; saying you brought someone to tears, on purpose, by talking to them isn't that will improve people's opinion of you.  I frame it as empathy instead of honesty, and the point I'm trying to make is that regardless of the words said, it's all about intent and inflection for how the point comes across.   If someone talks cringingly loud, the brutal way is to publicly say ""You're so loud we can hear you across the room."" The empathic way is to approach them afterwards, in private, and say ""Hey, great explanation earlier. Also, you don't need to talk so loud.""  I try to reverse the situation - How would I feel if someone publicly called something I'd been aware of and was working to fix? I'd be embarrassed, it *might* strengthen my resolve, and I'd think to avoid that person (or their attention in general) to avoid them noticing anything else. How would I feel if I weren't already aware of it? I'd have severe self-doubt issues and blame them on that speaker. If I were told about it later, in private? I would be thankful, try to fix it, and not remember the conversation in a week. I wrote more on my thought process, but they're not relevant now.  The point I'm trying to make is Why bring them to tears? What problem does this solve? What goals does this meet? How does this concretely help you (besides the short-term feel-goods)? Why have the conversation at all, and not just walk away?   Did you decide to knock him down a peg with a rehearsed statement? Or was it a vague problem you'd thought about and knocking him down was a convenient chance answer? Or was it pure spur of the moment?  People who think ""It's my duty to knock that asshole down a peg"" *are* the assholes."
"Yup, I do the same, just word it differently; saying you brought someone to tears, on purpose, by talking to them isn't that will improve people's opinion of you.  I frame it as empathy instead of honesty, and the point I'm trying to make is that regardless of the words said, it's all about intent and inflection for how the point comes across.   If someone talks cringingly loud, the brutal way is to publicly say ""You're so loud we can hear you across the room."" The empathic way is to approach them afterwards, in private, and say ""Hey, great explanation earlier. Also, you don't need to talk so loud.""  I try to reverse the situation - How would I feel if someone publicly called something I'd been aware of and was working to fix? I'd be embarrassed, it *might* strengthen my resolve, and I'd think to avoid that person (or their attention in general) to avoid them noticing anything else. How would I feel if I weren't already aware of it? I'd have severe self-doubt issues and blame them on that speaker. If I were told about it later, in private? I would be thankful, try to fix it, and not remember the conversation in a week. I wrote more on my thought process, but they're not relevant now.

"My mom has the biggest, loudest, most hilarious laugh in the world. It's so intense that it's almost like she's screaming. And once she gets going, it ain't stoppin. It's the kind of laugh that when strangers hear it they stop what they're doing and stare. She once had an entire taco bell (employees included) just all laughing their asses off together like we were at a party and had known eachother forever. It was just a small trip to fucken taco bell but for me it was like she had turned it into this beautiful moment where this group of strangers were just happy humans together at the same time. I'll never forget it. Her laugh is my favorite sound in the world."
"My grandma used to always say, ""you are the company you keep"". I hated it when I was younger because I thought she was just talking shit on my friends, but when I got older it made a lot more sense."
"It's like a modern day Alan Bennett story.  Still, if it made her feel bad, wouldn't she have stopped doing it long before ""years""? Or mentioned it to someone ""did you see x I put on Facebook?""  Maybe she intended to use it as a private journal, and it wasn't accidental.  If your posts are private by default, you can still comment on other people's statuses, can't you? She never did that?"

"I was about five or so. I was watching sesame street, and there was an older black lady they had on as a celebrity guest. I don't remember what her name was, but when she told elmo what it was he said, ""That's a weird name!"" And she replied with, ""I don't have a weird name, I have an UNUSUAL name."" Small statement, but I never forgot it. I still to this day think back to that when I label something/someone as weird without thinking. There's a huge difference between weird and unusual."

"Count your blessings. It was never really said to me, but I often think about all of the positive little things in day to day life and I've become good at it.

I've really learned to appreciate the little things in life and it really helped me lead a more overall positive and happy life.

"&gt; You've never had shitty or selfish impulses? If not you can't imagine what they're like, or believe that they exist?  Take these sentences and look at all the negatives in them. You are asking if I've never had shitty or selfish impulses in the first sentence. Then you say if I've not never had shitty or selfish impulses then I can't imagine what they're like. And the second sentence ends in a question mark and isn't a question. Or ARE you asking a question, predicated on never having shitty or selfish impulses, as to whether I can't imagine what they're like, or if I believe that they exist? Or maybe can't applies to both the verbs imagine and believe in your sentence and you are making the ""n't"" in ""can't"" perform double duty?  These are the first sentences in your post and I'm pretty sure you already said the opposite of what you meant to say, although who really can tell. Things don't get better from there either.  Why do you ask sarcastic things like ""can you tie your own shoelaces?"" and then wish me luck?  Your sentences are disjointed, with your random notes to yourself interwoven with comments at others. You actually used a triple negative in the most recent reply (even if one word is invented). You write the way some psychiatric patients talk. And laughably, you capitalize a sentence, for emphasis I presume, telling others to read next time, as if your sentences can be parsed.   The fact that you can even make that Shakespeare joke demonstrates you aren't stupid, so why were you writing like you are?"

"I've learned to never apologize unless real harm is done. You vent about your problems and we chose to read it, you have no reason to be sorry. But I see why you say it, I have that habit too. I think you're grateful to anyone who reads, and it makes sense to apologize to people you're grateful for, but it makes more sense to just say thanks for reading. Makes things much more positive :)    for example, ""Sorry for making you come to the blueberry festival "" would turn into ""Thanks for coming to the festival with me"".

"I agree! I think it can be *twisted* to justify inactivity if you think of everything that has happened or will happen as fixed and immutable. That's why I think the most impressive part of the book is how it's almost tongue in cheek in its presentation: a passive interpretation of the serenity prayer would make sense for the characters to admire, but the reader can end up rejecting that mentality specifically because of the way it is presented (even though it is presented logically and sympathetically).  So I agree that the prayer doesn't endorse inactivity, and I think Vonnegut uses it as the crucial factor in the story that reveals that fact to the audience."

Shut up american. You and auzzies just stole our language and ruined it! /s
"Why didn't you just ask them to reply in Italian? It'd be a good exercise for you to learn how to give an intro to someone, explaining that you are learning the language, and would like to try to use it with them."
"American expats don't tend to, and it's a bugbear of many of us in countries with local languages and dialects that we love, because we lose the sparkle of some of our traditions that are bonded to our dialects, and loathe the lack of effort in not bothering to try to be part of our culture. It's really wonderful that we have many languages and dialects in the world, but we'll lose them, if people don't bother to learn them."
"Well, it takes more than correcting, since many native users have a poor command of English, as an example. You may or may not realise that many of the English errors made on this website are made by Americans, who have studied English for years.  Language learning is about more than just finding anyone to learn from, as you'll learn bad habits and mistakes from poor users."
"An old camp counselor of mine told me this and it's my favorite quote. ""Someday all of this will be a distant memory, you get to make that memory now"" I like it not because it's uplifting but because it reminds me to keep doing things so that when everything is a distant memory it's a good one."
"It all depends on the quality of the corrector. It's really important to learn from someone with a strong command of a language. Otherwise, one will learn mistakes, bad habits and the limitations of the command of the corrector (who won't be aware of the variety of ways something can be expressed, without any of those ways being wrong)."
"I don't think of any language as difficult, so long as people are studying and using them every day. Those of us who use a lot of languages can do so effectively, only because we're often using them, and care about the standard, with which, we use them."
"I use both, and other languages, and don't feel much of a difference in learning either. Using languages every day, and caring about one's command being decent, are the only important things, in order to be able to effectively use a language."
"We regularly have fire drills here, and are held up by Americans asking what the announcements mean. Hard to imagine people not realising the danger they've put themselves, and everyone else, in by not learning a bit of the local languages."
People use their personal anecdotes of encountering 1 or 2 people to brand a whole country of people as whatever ignorant thing they can think of that allows them to play the victim.
"I don't agree with that. There are loads of people here in Switzerland with 3 native languages, who don't use English. You miss so much of the local culture and local norms, when you don't learn the local languages. You lose the opportunity to meet loads of the local people, when you don't learn the local languages. We have a real problem here with our culture drowning amongst those intent on using only American, only associating with fellow Americans, and only celebrating American customs."
"I don't think it's to do with ability. I use a varity of langages, as does almost everyone I know, and we simply study them and use them every day. We make an effort, and we realise we need to study every day."
"Except we don't. We use languages based on far more than the actual words. Our comprehansion, regardless of whether native user or not, is determined by loads of external factors that influence how I interpret something, and how you do. You can think people understand you, because you have the luxury of using your most familiar language, but you may be wrong. This is where using a variety of languages can be especially handy. If I share a few languages with a person, we can make sure we understand the same thing, because we can explain it a few different ways, and have a few different means of asking questions to determine if we understand."
What don't you agree with?
"You posted ""most speakers of any other language will at least learn some English"". That's not true."
I was at a train station in Hamburg and a homeless dude came up to me and asked for money in German.  I told him politely that I only spoke English.  So he asked for money in English.  Even homeless people in Europe are multi-lingual.  Damn.
"Well, most people do, maybe not in your country (although almost every Swiss person I know does, and you don't seem too bad either), but it's not exactly some obscure statistics I'm pulling out of my ass, English *is* very popular in every country in the world. Keep in mind Switzerland is also very peculiar in the sense that you have *4* official languages that are fairly different from each other, which might not encourage people to learn a 4th, 5th or 6th language. In China for instance, most people speak Mandarin and English or Cantonese and English, very rarely Mandarin and Cantonese."
"""Who you are speaks so loud, I cannot hear what you're saying."""
"What are the professions of the Swiss people you know? Which parts of Switzerland are they from? How many people are in your sample who are Swiss? We son't have 4 fairly different languages. We have 3 similar official ones, and, more importantly to us day-to-day, our dialects per city."
"Although Romansh, Italian and French are all Latin based languages, I would definitely not say the three of them are closely related (Romansh obviously closer to Italian), but for some similar grammatical structures.   I know a professor, several nurses, a few students and doctors. I know it's nowhere near a decent statistical sample, but [according to this website](http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html), 4.4 % or your citizens have English as a *first* language and 18% of your citizens speak it at work on a daily basis, which leads me to think that they speak it quite properly and that many more can speak it at least fairly well.  On a similar note, you can see German and Italian are decreasing as where other languages, mainly English and Portuguese, have been booming for the last decade."

"I know (I've been there; had to lose about 50lbs a few years back). Problem is, if you're too lazy to keep ""helping"" (i.e. work out, eat less), then it *is* hard. Or if you expect to lose 50lbs in 2 weeks.  If you're not, it's hard at first, but the gradual success will keep you going."

"edit: boy this got long. No need to read.  Are you seriously asking me why I said something sarcastic, after you unilaterally declared, nay pronounced, that what I was saying is a waste of time, and I should know it. That's not ""assertiveness"", that's, (while we're psychoanalysing, lol), no-theory-of-mind level rudeness.  And said, to me, that I might be a troll? (and if not a troll presumably an idiot or, it seems, a psychiatric case)  And said I write like a freshman in high school? Note- not that my writing was, e.g. ""unnecessarily unclear"", just calling me a kiddie.  Come on man. I even said ""re: verbal pleasantries:"" to try and turn your jabs, and my obligatory responses, into something friendly. And I also even said that if you weren't that interested in my post, that was probably for the best. I don't know how I could possibly have been nicer.  The reason I wished you luck is the same reason I responded without rudeness to your rude post (yeah that's technically a declaration too, but on clear and present facts): because I assumed, that you felt/thought, that I had given you a reason to feel frustrated (specifically, made a shitty attack on you based on your incidental use of ""Obama""), and I empathised with that.  (and like I said, the idea that I would say ""Obama, hmm?"" as a shitty way to call you a racist or something, was just too sad for me to be really annoyed with someone who (thought they) had had that presented to them. That's not remotely close to a thing I would do, but I guess some people might, so I understand why you suspected that.)  Also, if I was being actively hostile with that sarcasm, how would it be bad to end the post with at least some show of goodwill?   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  On my alleged incomprehensibility;  Well first off I might as well happily ""admit"" that making my posts easy to parse is not a high priority: the highest goal I have for one of my posts is to be just-the-sort-of-thing I would like to come across, and I love to read things that are full of asides and provisos and pseudoneologisms (like that one), and suchlike. Anything which serves as a stamp of easiness, playfulness, cleverness, or a particular individual's particular pattern of thought, is a big plus to me, and anything other than ""literally, actually, incoherent"", I don't care about.  &amp;nbsp;  But still, as it happens, I *was* fairly clear.  The ""if not"" refers to the possibility that you have *not* had the experience of shitty or selfish impulses.  Lets say that's a typo, or a mistake. Why should it be confusing?   Wouldn't that be exactly the kind of mistake that people should be able to skip over, and understand from context?   Like, you put ""no nothing about"" instead of ""know nothing about"", and I didn't have trouble with it, literally 0 trouble, and I wouldn't have complained about it if I had, because imo that's basic reading generosity. The only reason I even noticed is out of pettiness.  If what I put was indeed just backwards, then that's arguably a bigger mistake, but either way, extra negations are common, simple, slip ups, so I think someone should be ready for them.  &amp;nbsp;  But it wasn't even a mistake! The first question is basically asking, ""you have had that experience, right?"", because such experiences are nigh-universal.  ""If so"", would conflict with that implication, and the implication is far more important here than the literal phrasing of the question. If I wanted to use ""if so"", I could have phrased the question differently, but this way was spot on for the type of incredulousness I had at what I was replying to.  Yes the second sentence was a question, as you describe, and ""can't"" does apply to both imagine and believe. (why wouldn't it?)   I don't see a triple negative (though sometimes they can be used without issue).  Unless you're reading ""ununderstandable"" as a double negative? Or you replied and I edited out a mistake in my in my post at the same time?  The (logical) implication that my sentences literally can't be parsed is, if interpreted literally, absurd, so I'm going to assume you didn't particularly mean that. The implied premise in the idea that, if I was unparsable, then active misreading would be sensible: that if something doesn't make sense (to you) you should just make something up and respond to that instead, is absurd no matter how I slice it.  Why was I writing as if I was stupid? I...wasn't. I'd have to get very verbose if I was to answer and explain all the different varieties of what exactly that might mean, so I'll leave it at that. An assertion and a contradiction.  It's very generous of you to say my shakespeare joke demonstrates I'm not stupid, rather than not entirely stupid, so thanks for that.  Also are you downvoting my replies to you, because that's kind of pointless? Like I could downvote you back, if I was petty, but then we'd be half way to mustard gas and all kinds of philosophical problems.  Anyway, Pretty good wishes still!"

"Actually, the languages we'd call similar are French, German and Italian. We don't learn them as foreign languages, so your idea that we'd just their similarity based on grammar is odd. Do you understand how people acquire multiple native languages? Did you also note my point that we use dialects day-to-day?  If you need to now substantiate your claims with skewed internet searches (cognitive dissonance), I think you should just admit you made baseless claims. Especially in light of you making claims on the back of knowing a handful of highly educated people in prestigious positions and academia. Do you realise we have people of all walks of life in Switzerland, not just highly educated, and not just people with lofty job titles? Wouldn't you expect highly educated people to have a command of a variety of languages?  I live here, and don't see, nor hear any decline in our mother tongues, aside from the damage expats who don't learn them do. Expats who don't learn our languages have no effect on us, beyond the negative - the come, they damage our culture, they leave..."

"This is the story of my life.  I've played music for about 20 years now, and some of the most talented people I've ever seen are garage guys because they don't work to get their band out there.  Those of us who are mediocre still get out and play because we're willing to make the phone calls."

"Quasi-similar: My brother and I were shooting the shit many years ago, when I was mentioning playing Call of Duty online with some friends. We had won the match, and I said something to the effect of ""We raped the other team"". My brother is a paramedic, and also one of the most jovial, funny guys I know. HE turned to me with a dead serious expression and asked me simply: ""Have you ever seen a rape victim?"" - ""No."" - ""You wouldn't say that if you did.""     It hit me like a ton of bricks. I've never used the term 'rape' in that cavalier fashion ever since, and it really was one of the cornerstone moments when I started stepping back from trying to be ""shock"" funny, and just tried to be a good person."

"Yeah, with immigration it would be a whole different topic, it's kind of expected to learn the local language over time- I just meant travelling.    I have a local dialect which will not be appropriate to use anywhere but with my close relatives in the future, but you bet that I'm going to teach my future children some of it because even if it might not seem pretty to other people, I cherish it."
Because you care?
"We have a real problem with American expats who don't learn our languages and dialects, who damage our culture and only mix with fellow Americans, and then leave. I wish Americans would realise that this is a huge problem with the expat community in other countries."

"I don't know about that, I haven't really experienced that.    I wouldn't expect any people to learn my specific dialect though, a lot of people from other parts of the country can't speak it either and it's even more difficult than just the standard language."
"Our dialects are what we use. We only use the official languages for letters to the police etc. Even a conversation with bodies like the police would happen in our dialects.  I want to also draw attention to the danger it causes - when we have fire drills, we are held up by Americans asking what the announcements mean, and what they should do. This means thex couldn't handle an emergency, so put themselves, and other, at risk."
"As I said, that's not really a situation that I can relate to but it doesn't sound ideal.  Maybe it'd help if they got more opportunities to hang out with the locals, after all it's pretty difficult to learn other languages and it's more comfortable to stay in your little community, but it's probably worth it to have more contact with each other."
In most cases English is their third language. They have a native language and then the national language and then English.

I admire that and on top of it, you were cordial about it. Good on you.  Secondly, I think I need to reflect a little on my own writing if I'm making no/know substitutions and reading ""ununderstandable"" as a double negative, just as you suggested.  I do however think you might invest some small portion of your abilities in clarity of writing so people like me don't dismiss you immediately. Perhaps a little less Henry James and a little more Hemingway. The internet is dark and full of shitty people and my guard is up. If the people that can use correct grammar don't, civilization is doomed. I happen to like the same things you like in writing, and I don't want to play any part in extinguishing that in you.  I doubt that we even disagree on the Bush/Obama/Pharma issue all that much. Perhaps that conversation could be continued more civilly.  Also no, I wasn't downvoting you. I have a life."

"Was driving around somewhere with my best friend in high school. I made some kind of rude comment about him, don't even remember what it was but I partly said it hoping to provoke a reaction. Instead of giving me one, he laughed and said ""that's cool"" as if agreeing with me - not offended, not angry, not arguing with me. I adopted that approach basically for the rest of my life - hearing information but not needing to accept or even refute it. Especially when it comes to criticism or opinions about you from others."
"Went on a date with a rich asshole who sneered when I talked about looking for another job because my current one doesn't pay enough. He said I was lazy and had I thought about having two jobs. (He was and as far as I know still is unemployed because he doesn't need to be.) I explained that I've had two jobs my entire life, even while in school full time, and I was tired of having to work so hard. He said that I graduated four years ago.  He was right. I got another job and life stopped sucking. Of course a.) fuck that guy, he never has to work a day in his life so hooray for telling a poor person to work herself to the bone cause it's what you deserve and b.) I lost the second job, so now life is shitty again."
"Oh god. When I was 16, I read Atlas Shrugged, and became a hardcore libertarian. I was totally vain and elitist.

She explained that because I hated myself I was all I thought about. I was pretty much just aware of myself and the rest of the world was a blur. I was too consumed by my tiny mistakes to pay attention to the people around me. I wasn't intentionally ignoring people, but it was a direct result of my thinking.   So basically she told me to get the fuck over myself. I'm a damn human like everyone else, so why do I get special rules and standards? Just hold myself to the standards I expect of other people and pay attention to something else for once. It really shook me up and made me flip my whole perspective on my self esteem."

"“Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god. ”   ― Aristotle, Politics  I like to think I'm a beast-god."

"&gt; It's not easy for everyone to do.   It's not easy for *anyone*. It's work. You can learn a language in 3-6 months, if you basically make it your job to do that and nothing else.

You can't work on it half an hour every week and expect to become good at it in a few months. Watch movies, read books, news, spanish subreddits, whatever. Don't study, use the language. If you want to learn spanish, the assumption is that there is something in that language / culture that interrests you, and you just have to emerse yourself, even if you don't really understand most of the time. You don't even have to try to speak it, as long as you learn how it sounds like, how to read it, and slowly build up your vocabulary.  Source: I've never even set foot in english speaking country.

But one question. Were you rushing or were you dragging!?
The only thing you need is your self.
"When I was about 12, I was going to youth group and Sunday church with a friend pretty regularly. I even was helping run the younger youth group and their summer camp. My family wasn't religious, and never pressured me either way though. On a trip to the store one day, my brother flat out asked me the logic behind ""a man in the sky choosing our destiny."" I couldn't really dispute his point, so I stopped going to church after that and now only go with others under respect for them and their beliefs if I'm invited. It's a silly thing to change me in a huge way, and I'm not downplaying anyone's beliefs (you do you), but I'm glad he said something to me to sort of wake me up. I wasn't 100% into the religion anyway so it's better this way."
"Well some people are more talented to work hard, they have a natural tendency to be disciplined. The hard thing is  to learn to be disciplined without having any discipline."
"""Happiness is here and now"" is a quote by the Plum Village Buddhist group, and I first heard it from a monk who gave a talk explaining why happiness is basically the default state for humanity.  It definitely changed my perspective; all this time, I'd been trying to search for happiness by experiencing things and working until I'd suddenly have some magical feeling. But realizing that being content comes from within myself and all depends on a mindset shift was quite liberating."

"""The moment you stop growing is the moment you start dying"" An mentor of mine said this to me during a small reunion we had at a diner to catch up. I had just had a particularly rough time because therapy caused me to realize I was sexually abused by another kid growing up not to mention beaten unnecessarily by adults and that left me with so many issues I didn't realize I had that I didn't know what to do anymore. I prided myself and found identity in being so in control of my emotions and knowing myself, but those discoveries broke me down to my foundation man. It almost seemed easier to just file it all away in my mind and chug along praying it never came along again. But these simple words changed me. They meant that I either choose to work through it all and maybe revisit some vicious memories, or let them define my life."

"I was extremely and terribly bullied for most of my life for being ""ugly"". It really really affected me for a long time. During and after high school I was going through a really hard time of depression and would complain to people ""Why me? Why did I have to go through this? Its not fair."" Playing and believing I was such a victim in life. One of my friends then replyed, ""Every person who walks this planet goes through shit. Bad shit. Every. Single One.""   After that situations would start appearing to me about stuff that other people had to face that was really traumatic to them. At that moment the clouds parted and I started to understand that we all may think we got the short end of the stick in life, but it turns out if you ask everyone their story..there tragedy in every single one. Nobody gets out of life alive."

He believes that the text of ancient authors is generally sound, not because he has acquainted himself with the elements of the problem, but because he would feel uncomfortable if he did not believe it; just as he believes, on the same cogent evidence, that he is a fine fellow, and that he will rise again from the dead.""  &amp;nbsp;  ""meddles""! ahhhhh"

"I've got another not-so-profound one that changed me forever. During my Plumbing apprenticeship, i was like all other apprentices. I needed my journeyman's help the second things got bad. One day, i stumbled into a problem in the job site that none of my previous training could solve. I called him over and explained what i was having problems with. He shook his head and asked ""What's the solution?""  He didn't help me cause he knew i could figure it out myself through plain old critical thinking. I solved the problem on my own and every other problem from that day on never asking for his help again. I slowly went from being the worst apprentice in the company to the best after that day.  Seems dumb but it just really hit me hard realizing (not to be cheesy) that the answers were within me all along."

"Cheating is worse, actually. If you think smoking is worse, it means you're a bad person.  Smoking says nothing about what kind of person you are.  Cheating, however, says a lot.  It says you are dishonest.  It says you are incompetent.  It says you are worthless without better people than you around.  It means you can be relied upon for nothing, because all of your qualifications may be fraudulent.  Tests exist for a reason. It is to evaluate ability.  Cheating not only means that you don't ever bother to learn the material, but that you acquire qualifications which you aren't qualified for.  Cheating hurts other people."
"They're both deeply dishonest acts.  And frankly, if someone cheats on tests, why would you expect them not to cheat in relationships?  Cheating, after all, is in part about not getting caught, and not caring about what harm you might cause to others by doing it."
Obviously you didn't learn those words if you had to cheat.  The reality is that you cheated to put yourself ahead of others.
"That system exists to make sure that someone who should be a janitor on a porno set isn't making important decisions.  You are harming everyone else by cheating if you should be that janitor.  If every person who thought like you died, the world would be a much better place."
"The entire point of the system is to make sure that people know their stuff.  Every person who cheats to make their way through is putting all the people who depend on them in danger in the future.  They're the fuckers who use cheap concrete on their oil rigs.  They're the incompetent doctors who make medical errors.  They're the moronic programmers who leave huge security holes in their code.  They're the people who build faulty bridges, who cut corners on buildings, who do all the bad things in the world.  Fuck them. They're evil.  Their dreams SHOULD slip away if they can't cut it.  The system exists as it does for a reason. We don't want incompetent morons working on crucial projects.  Fuck them up the ass.  Every single incompetent coworker is this kind of person."
"So what you're saying is you cheat on tests?  I would bet you money that people who cheat on tests are more likely to cheat on their partners.  Why?  Because if you are willing to be dishonest about one thing, you're much more likely to be dishonest about other things."
&gt; That system exists to make sure that someone who should be a janitor on a porno set isn't making important decisions.  That system doesn't work. 99% of the people making important decisions in this world suck at it.
"Why do tests exist?  They exist to analyze ability.  If you cheat on tests, it means that you have no credentials.  Everyone who cheats on tests should be put in a big database and have their name posted for all to see, so that everyone knows never to hire this person for anything important. There is no way to know if they're qualified, and they'll happily lie about it.  Because that's what tests are."
"It is actually substantially lower than that.  Your belief otherwise means that you are one of the people who shouldn't be allowed to do anything but hold a mop. It is a common form of projection and self-justification, to believe everyone is as evil and incompetent as you are, and therefore, you, personally, are doing nothing wrong.  Most of the people who make important decisions and shouldn't be, cheated to get there."
"You're way off - and my world views and their reasoned explanations (as well as my concept of self) are much more interesting than that.

"Not really. I'm not willing to hurt another person like that.  And while I don't consistently cheat on tests, I have before, and have nothing against those that do (unless it's a standardized test, or a career-focused test i.e. cheating on a test in med school).   If you think your logic makes any sort of sense, then you should be admitting that a parent who tells their child Santa is real is also willing to cheat on their spouse because - well - all dishonesty is equal."

"Either your trolling or your an alien, your body needs water. There is no way you went 2 months without drinking water. You must be just bones, because muscles can't work without water, vitamins or minerals. You can't escape the laws of human biology, You'd be just surviving on your organs and muscle until you died."
"Not a troll. Alien...maybe. The body can be nourished 2 ways, via the blood system using food or via the nervous system using light, sound, energy frequencies. Man must 1st be born of flesh and then reborn into spirit. It is the ENTIRE PURPOSE in life. Same as some cars take gas, some are electric. Water is ONLY required for digestion and elimination....if you don't eat, you don't poop."
"Total bullshit to me, I would need to see proof and it's never been proven. I believe a human can go a long time without food or water through meditation, but defiantly not decades. There was a women in Seattle who did the same shit and she said she stopped becasue she didn't want to drop below 120 lb, and she lost over 30lbs doing so, while puking bile and feeling faint when bending over, looking like a bag of bones. She also drank water but very little. Your muscles and cells need water to function, otherwise they cramp. Your telling me you haven't had a single sip of water or bit of food since you've started this. When did you start this and will you never have water or food until the day you die? Also how much do you weigh, becasue your must be less then 100lbs. If you tell me you've had specifically water or food at all, your claim is false."
"This is easier said than done, unfortunately :("
"I was a cleaning lady. I mean I had the bleached stained pants, the caddy full of chemicals and a bandanna for my hair I was the who shebang. Now, I didn't mind clearing your shit, or tidying your room, or even doing your dishes. What I did mind was if you expected a deep clean (the things you dont clean often: basboards, cabinets, fans, etc...) when all that time went to me doing things you could've done anf I could've made better. I loved my job. Nobody bothered me, I got to clean, and most people were grateful. One time a little boy left candy wrappers in his room like a hundred no joke and cans, snacks, uneaten food, and it took me a solid 2 hours to clean his room. I was paid for 4 hours. The owner came home and I told her. Guess who had a less hellish room next time and a cleaner house? Yes, I'm paid to do it but I will do a better job if you aren't  a douch canoe."
"And I have NOTHING to prove to you. I'm just saying.... Some can do it...some can't. I assume you can't. There is always a ying and a yang....we live in a polar world.  Some learn how to live in spirit....some NEVER do. Perhaps, YOU never will."
"Well you could have at least told me you haven't had water or food in some sort of time frame, becasue I know theres no way you could go two years without food or water. I would challenge you to accomplish that. Also you should atleast prove it, just makes it seem your talking out your ass. Also I could probably do it, dont assume I can't. I know of meditation techniques that can allow humans to for go food/water for longer than average but why would I, as its unhealthy."
"But yeah, my whole life in flesh (eating food/water) I weighed 104...past 7 years in spirit (without food/water) I weigh 94 lbs. I jog 5 km everyday. Since 2007, I have sometimes tried to eat and drink but within 5-10 minutes....it's projectile vomit. My body is pure. I don't put any drugs, alcohol, food that has toxins, and ALL food has toxins. But like GENESIS in the bible states, seeds can be eaten. So when I am living in the winter without proper light energy from the sun, I eat 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds in a day. If I am in Cancun, where there is lots of sunlight energy, I don't need sunflower seeds. As a root race, humans USED to live off the sun ONLY. You should google ....you will find out for yourself the answers you seek. Just saying......humans can AND NEED TO RETURN to getting their energy from the sun to evolve into the next root race. You do believe in evolution don't you. I mean I'm not just some crazy ass stupid chick. I have spent over 12 years researching all of this, I have published 3 books, written a fourth, written 3 film scripts and currently writing a fourth. And I ACTUALLY HAVE LIVED what I write about. For reals."
"I have been looking into it as I've commented, but to me it still doesnt make sense. It mentions atlantis and transitions from Mercury and people living with dinosaurs. Also writing books means nothing to me. People write about hokey pokey stuff all the time and get it published. I really dont mean to offend im just flabbergasted by what Ive read. It falls in line with religion/conspiracy level stuff IMO. Also yes I beleive in evolution, but this root races things is far from what we know about evolution, even though it seems like sort of evolution process itself.  If your happy with what you do, than im glad for you. But the universe is weird ass place that no one knows the true anwsers too, but I will thank you for opening me to different view of life and I will say sorry If I sounded like a dick earlier but it bugs me when people claim things (especially things unordinary) and dont try to even explain themselves. Also what do you mean by spirit? Are you not in a body now, do you not have flesh."
"Spirit just means energy....yes I have a flesh body but I can be animated by an over excitation of the nervous system rather than using food via the blood system to feed the body. It's a clean and free energy. Kinda like Frankenstien I suppose. Yup I know ....he's fictional. I'm the same as you though.....I only believe the truths I experience.  When you eat a tomato....what you are doing is ingesting the energy from the sun that went into growing that tomato....the tomato is just the middle man. You don't need him....IF YOUR BODY IS PURE. Like Michael Jackson, if you put anything unpure in your body...you cannot be sustained by the sun. He didn't eat food but took lots of drugs....legal or illegal doesn't matter."

"so ""pretty"" is defined by the shape of the body now?"
"I'm wondering how you stumbled across a random 2-week old comment. But to answer your question, the ""right"" shape is exactly what beauty is and always has been, not some new definition that I just made up. Physical beauty can generally be defined as good symmetry, a healthy and capable body, nice skin, perkiness, a defined face, etc. You can add in gender-specific traits that are attractive like defined visible muscle mass for men, and a high hip or bust to waist ratio for women. All of these things diminish with excessive weight.  All individuals will have their own preferences about the details, and some individuals will have preferences that go directly against what is typical (people that genuinely prefer 400lb morbidly obese people over someone right in the middle of the healthy weight range, people that find certain typically non-sexual body parts sexually attractive, etc), but you can pretty well define what the majority considers physically attractive with the above descriptions.  Pretty is not ""defined by the shape of your body now."" Pretty has always been defined by the shape (more accurately, composure) of our bodies. Attractiveness as a whole is another story and includes things like personality, social status, wealth, etc. But pretty itself can be defined very well by the composure of your body."
That made me really happy and appreciative of my life.
"""No one is the villain of their own story."" Has answered a lot for me."
"Lot of crazy interpretative responses here. Still going to add another that's worth reading:   Our perspective is only one view of the world, complete with its blind spots: a chicken's world doesn't extend beyond the coop, a horse's not past its blinders. If you never take the time or chance to learn what's past yours, you'll never discover what is.  Let life surprise you."
But once you get to that place of no baggage...you never want to go back! I have found that loving those who hate me is soooooo much less energy than hating them! i am very sensitive to energy so negative emotions I can really feel affect my life when I let them linger for too long.

"I was part of a ""thing with a woman"" and a lot of people got hurt. I got very depressed and it was affecting my work (cvs) and the assistant manager, shurla, she wanted to know what was up.   I explained the situation, i won't now because it was stupid kid shit, and she said ""you know why it bothers you so much uberguby? Because youre a good person""   I was totally floored. Nobody had said that to me before. I had always been praised for my intelligence and my kindness but nobody had ever accused me of being, on a level that is fundamental to my construction, ""good"". And i didn't feel like a good person because   A: I was a part of this shit storm of evil behavior.   B: just because of who i am, i had become quite accustomed to assuming i was a piece of shit who couldn't do anything right.   I don't even know how to describe how it changed me, because im at work and its very complex, but that was the beginning of me changing the way i perceive myself, perceive others, and perceive God. If she had never said it, things probably wouldn't have turned out so different, but that was the first ""upward"" force in a few weeks of spiraling depression.

Hey man just saw this reply while going through my inbox. What do you use to analyze your games?
"It'd probably be better if you searched r/chess, a few people give really nice itemized lists on how to analyze games well. (Sidenote, following those lists takes a lot of time, if you're going to do them to the t, you should probably play a 45+45 game and really get a good game to analyze, rather than try and apply an hour of analysis to 10 minutes of chess), but the basic premise is: A) Think about what went wrong in the game after you played it, not looking through the moves, just general ideas, i.e., I played weirdly in the opening, allowing him to damage my center, then he, with better middlegame play and obvious targets available, forced me into an isolate queen's pawn situation and eventually won that pawn, then.... endgame stuff, traded down pieces, lost game.  B) Click through the game, looking at moves, considering alternatives (I know it seems weird since you already thought the thoughts in-game that you might think at this step, but you're going to see your opponent's moves and realize why some of your moves weren't good.) C) Use a chess engine, analyze through the whole game again, look at where you lost a lot of ground according to the engine (-1 from stockfish evaluation=reasonably big fuckup, -2 or more = game losing often).  For me, this process is: Play on lichess, click through game with local variation analysis off, look at the critical position(s) of the game and consider alternatives, click request analysis, use both the graph/the inaccuracy detection+turn local variation analysis on, consider moves the computer knew were good, and whenever I don't get why the computer move is good, play through some variations to understand why deviating from its continuation is bad (i.e. don't see the reason why a sacrificed piece can't be taken, try taking it, see that the engine found a way to win a queen off taking it, etc)"

"I never worked hard and I just did well in all my classes; never spending time outside of class to study or do homework, I still did better than those who did actually work hard.

"I think The Legend of Korra portrayed this pretty well. Except season 2, that guy literally just wanted to be the face of all evil and destroy the world and throw it completely out of balance for no reason.  But Amon, Zaheer, and Kuvira were all portrayed as somewhat relatable/good in some way. You could see their motives and actually kind of agree with what they had to say almost. Season 3 especially was very conflicting for me personally."
"Ouch. I was thinking about this. I'm very young and make a ton of money. I'm now realizing just how frivolous money really is. My brother always gives me a hard time b/c I make good money and have it easy. However, when I started getting unknown bumps on my skin money didn't mean a thing. Whether I was poor or not I just wanted to get rid of this scary thing. Granted, money can get you good doctors and all but you're still sick."

"Old priest said love is not a noun, not a thing to find, but a verb; it's what we do and the definition of the verb ""to love"" is ""to serve.""  I immediately knew he was right and that I loved very few. Saving grace was that all my pants were worn on one knee because I was always down on one knee tying shoes and zipping coats and combing hair and blowing noses and giving hugs, all the thousand and one things a father does for his small child on one knee (women tend to squat.) This is love, this servitude. It's done without judgement, without expectation of reciprocation or even recognition. It's just what you do. Feelings are easy to have, requiring no effort. Service requires effort."

My good friend was mentored by Deming for 8 years. He told me this quote
"[–]Redditron5[S] 11 points 2 months ago  I've been back for two weeks. Integration is very difficult. I work for an oil company. I constantly feel uneasy and restless at work now. I am not doing what I love and I'm hurting the environment. I've also left a beautiful place with amazing human beings and I am no dropped back into the evils of corporate America, with it's greed and dehumanization. It's not fun. It's painful."
"How is it that only a couple short months later you've fully reverted back to being an amoral oil company stooge justifying your destruction of the planet bro? What happened bro? Plastics can be made from plant polymers like lignin. Jet fuel can be made from algae. Diesel engines run on vegetable oil and they can be hybridized with electric (solar, wind) or hydrogen. Etc. We don't need petroleum. The only reason there still is a petroleum industry is because oil companies sabotaged Carter's administration when Bush Sr, Cheney, Rumsfeld (the usual suspects) cut an arms deal with their Saudi butt buddies to embargo us and cut an arms deal with the Ayatollah to keep the hostages until their puppet, Reagan, was elected, all in order for oil company stooges such as yourself to maintain profit while you murder and displace all of those amazing human beings you loved so much by destroying that beautiful place. You should be in pain. You deserve it. A lot of it. Far more than you know. I hope you get what you deserve."
Good point. Self awareness and of the surroundings is very important.

"I read an interesting book called 'Genius in all of us', and no, it's not a self-help book. Rather, it's looking at what 'genius' and 'talent' really are in scientific terms. Once you unravel the mysterious definition of talent, you realise that almost all great artists or anyone who is a master of anything just dedicated practice a LOT, and usually from an incredibly young age. This is why I believe you can have some natural inclination to certain things, but even most of that is early social conditioning you don't realise - (you access to art as a toddler, the reason your interest was sparked, for example). However, there's no evidence to suggest that if a healthy adult who had never picked up a paint brush in their life had the will power to to learn to paint or draw to an impeccable level, they wouldn't be able to.

"When I was 11 I met an old friend from kindergarten. We began talking about ""old times"" and she mentioned a boy I used to hang out with a lot.   She said: ""Do you remember Max? The one you used to play with."" I said I remembered and she continued; ""Well he never really wanted to hang out with you, he liked a girl named Denise and he said he always hated being made to play with you when he wanted to be with her instead.""  I was super shocked. He was a friend from kindergarten, so maybe I shouldn't have taken it so seriously... But still to this day I have a hard time accepting that people can like me for real. I almost never try to make new friends out of that fear and I am constantly worried that my friends and family secretly hate me. It sucks, but I'm working on my self-esteem xD  Tl;dr: I was told an old friend of mine secretly didn't like me and since then I've had trouble trusting people."

"I think I really needed to read this. I have these moments with my gf when I understand that she's feeling down even from the way she writes and I insist on her opening up with me. I love her too much to see her sad and I honestly try to help, feeling like it's the right thing to do. I'm just starting to understand that me pressuring her could exacerbate things. She know she can trust me and tell me everything, and she will if and when she wants to."
"I used to lifeguard at a water park in my home town. One very busy day I was sitting on the stand and this older guy was standing next to me watching all his kids play. He looks at me and asks if I want to have kids one day,  and I tell him yes one day. He tells me ""you need to get set before you have kids. Get yourself a truck, a boat, a motorcycle, whatever fun stuff you want before you have kids because once you have them your not going to be able to do that kind of stuff anymore."" It really made 16 year old me think that I need to make sure I have my life together before I decide to rear a child."
"The school lost its accreditation.  It is actually something that CAN happen, which has no basis on what the students have done, though what the school has done or failed to do, to uphold its accreditation.

And the fact that he was black is relevant because...?
"Because of the way it was said, number 1. Number 2, he was black, and I felt like writing that he was black. Fuck off."
"How about you fuck off? You clearly have some unresolved issues within yourself to be so rude. I was making the point that people always point out when someone is black, but when someone white says something his or her race is never brought up. It's like white is the default race and everyone else is ""other"" which people always feel compelled to point out."
"I see what you're saying, but what I wrote was verbatim.  I grew up along many black people, went to black schools, and was educated within black culture, hence my post, and the lesson that came along with it. It was upvoted over 600 times, and noone felt the need to pint that out but you.  Having said that, if a black guy says something to me, and he is black, and I'm describing it in a way that was delivered with black linguistics, then there is no need to jump down my throat that I said ""an older black guy"". It is relevant within the context of what I'm trying to convey."
"I'm not jumping down your throat because I'm really not even mad over it. I just pointed it out because I see people doing this all of the time and half the time people don't even realize why they're doing it. It also hits home for me because as a black person myself I am never seen as an individual. Of course if someone pointed out that I was black they would only be stating facts, but the fact that most people have an insatiable urge to bring it up but if some white guy says something he's just ""a guy,"" it does get annoying."
"And I do see your point, but in my case, it really was relevant to the story, and I do believe it gave the statement more character, in a good way. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, and I see your point, but in this case, I think it's safe to say we're all good, right?"

"""Imagine"" that first word and the many wise words to come of a wonderful song by the late John Lennon. My mind was opened to a many great number of things and I wonder now how I could have been so sheltered to the real world and so unquestioning of moral and logical disputes against humanity and how I used to think things as heinous as the death penalty were justified for the sake of revenge or any other petty ""reasoning"" and I was only nine and wondered how grown adults could believe such nonsense and live with such ignorance when the world and truth are at your grasp and the things you thought were simple are much more complicated but the things you thought were complicated are sometimes much more simple. It isn't hard to understand the difference between right and wrong or what is logical and what is illogical, you just have to take the time to look and if you really have looked then you will certainly understand but if you deny looking that's your fault and your ignorance is your burden and sometimes sadly the burden of others. The world would be a much better place if everyone could stop every so often to think, to really think, and be more rational, kind, understanding and empathetic to one another and just let each other be and live your life with love, wonder and curiosity and understand that your not the only one hurting and the world despite it's many flaws is a beautiful place and every person who realizes this and lives by these philosophies can make every step of the way to a civilized and compassionate world a better and happier place."
"Here, Take this Lsd."
"A few months ago, a teacher of mine went off on the whole class and had a tangent about how we were all dumb and useless and that we shouldn't even bother going to college or entering the work force because we would fail. I probably should have prefaced this with the fact that I had  been (and still am) struggling with depression, anxiety, and extremely low self esteem, so, naturally this hit me especially hard. I put my head down on the desk and cried for a solid 10 minutes. I had lost all hope for my future because some unprofessional bitch got impatient with a bunch of teenagers. After this whole ordeal, I spoke to another teacher who i really trust and has always been really close to me. He said something that I'll never ever forget. ""Do you respect her?"" No. ""Then why the fuck do you give a shit about anything she has to say? She doesn't know you and she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about"". From then on, I've been much more hopeful and confident about my future, and am so grateful to have a trusted adult like him in my life.    TLDR: If somebody is an asshole, ask yourself if you respect them. If not, why care what they have to say?"
"Yeah, fuck that bitch.  That's a crazy story.  As someone much older than you, I can say that your future is in your own hands and that high school is a temporary world that doesn't mean shit in the long run.  Seriously, you'll be out of that place in a pretty short amount of time.  College is great, but is not really the most important thing.   It's much more important to just get out of your comfort zone occasionally, have experiences that you would not be normally used to, and find the things that you're drawn to and pursue them.  Depression sucks, but if you're not clinically depressed then you've got a lot of wiggle room to take control of your life and shape your own destiny.  Good luck."

"My math teacher right now teaches Calculus and Statistics. He also is the coach for my robotics team, which leads to the situation in which he said this to me. Since I didn't have a ride then (and still don't have a license now) I was riding with him after a robotics competition. We stopped at a gas station, where he bought a lottery ticket, which I found really strange. I mean he, of all people, should KNOW the chances of winning the Powerball, and how the game is rigged so it's basically a waste of money. What he said was  ""Well, you have to play in order to win""  Which, while I'm sure hasn't quite hit me as much as it needs to and will, changed my perspective. I would love to say that I've changed my whole life around from that point, but I'm still 18, no job, no license, no girlfriend, and no concrete plans beside getting a degree at a college but I still think it's an interesting quote."

"I have always been a nice, judgement free person. Until I started hanging out with the wrong people. When I was in high school, the people I hung out with were very mean and always judged people by looks. There was a girl in one of our classes who was very loud and her personality was a little out there. She also dressed pretty weird. We always made fun of her behind her back. One day, I got to class early. I over heard her talking to a friend of hers and she was really upset. She said ""I hate that people don't like me because I dress and act a little different. It's not my fault that mom beats me and hasn't bought me new clothes in three years."" Changed my entire perspective. I have never once been that mean again.

"Just an edit: I recently got an email from someone I thought was gone forever because of a terrible end to the relationship. The email arrived seven years after we'd last spoken, and the whole thing was an apology, a thanks, a stating of regrets. I'm not saying this'll happen to you, but it kinda proved to me that no, I didn't fuck anything up, and the person had changed because of me, and that they'd cared and still care a lot about me.  Sometimes it takes a fair amount of distance and emotional disconnection from a situation to recognize every facet of it, to analyze it and see what was objectively good/bad about it, and how each person played their part.   Kinda like living inside a snowglobe vs. living outside one. Inside: you're a house in the center of a blizzard that just keeps falling and the world keeps shaking you up. Outside the globe, you can see the house from every angle, watch each snowflake, analyze how the blizzard falls on the house. But because you're not in the globe anymore, and you're not shaking, you can think with a steady mind about everything that went on when you were inside.

"1.  ""Would You follow YOU? Step outside of your body and visualise yourself and decide, would You follow YOU?""   2. ""The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is now."" - Chinese proverb   3. ""When you're at the top of a building and you are walking along a ledge, you can go: ""What if I fall, What if I fall, What if I fall."" Or you can go: ""Put one foot here, put one foot here, put one foot here.""   4. Like many of you I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realise that there is nothing bigger than myself."" - Jim Carrey   5. ""You begin to change your thinking from appearances and how things look and how other people view me. Because everytime you find yourself upset in life, about anything that anyone else has said. What your really saying is; what you think about me, is more important than what i think about me."" - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer.   Here are 5 Quotes I really like. Number 1 and 4 I would say change my way of thinking the most. But what changed my way of thinking completely was watching some ""motivational"" speeches but you don't listen to them as motivational. You listen to what they actually say and start shifting paradigm. Eric Thomas alone helped my shift in thinking to 90%, I kept watching one video of his over and over and after a couple of weeks, I finally understood. It went from motivational and me being kinda restricting, to understand and embrace it."
all history is the history of class struggles
"Father (low-paid hard-working agricole employee) told me once:  ""Study hard and get your degrees. Because when you have degrees, you give orders instead of receiving them""  Priceless advise."
But you might be able to pull it out.
That reminds me of Murakami. Really nice quote.
I like the optimism but talent is a very real thing
I wish my parents saw this 10 years ago... amen
Maaan this made me tear up
This one got me :3
"went back to get my undergrad at 30, do not regret it for one second. Going back to school when you are a little older makes you really appreciate it. Take the classes you enjoy and go after a degree that makes sense for you good luck!"
I hope you're in a safe place now.
"As a former teacher, I'll tell you we appreciate the chuckle, but you still didn't answer it correctly.  Though I hope you did! You should have your grades by now haha  edit: holy shit it's my cake day! I had no idea."
"Similar to Mae West's “Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.”"
"""Treat yourself like you would treat your best friend."" A friend told me this years ago. We all have a tendency to judge ourselves too harshly, beat ourselves for way too long. With our friends, however we are kinder, more compassionate and tell them that it isn't as bad as it seems.  We need to comfort and soothe ourselves instead of constantly wallowing in self-loathing."

"I buddies Dad says to us just before we head back to college, ""Don't let anyone outwork you."" Really helped me stay hungry and motivated."
you were doing the right thing by compelling others to improve and step their game up. people too fucking concerned with protecting feelings over pursuing their best interests
better to have talent than the need to practice

"Another great one for you to remember could be that all your feelings and opinions are made up. That one has helped me out a lot. Whenever I was sick worried because I had said something I didn't mean I could just calm down, look around me and see that the world was indeed not on fire.  Wish you luck dealing with your ideas ;)"
It's definitely not how much you make. If you only spend money on things that really matter to you (and paying the bills) you'll feel richer than if you spend money all the time on bs even if you make more.  It's super easy for rich af people to feel poor. All that's necessary is poor spending habits.
Not really. It's much easier to eliminate big costs than to increase income.
"Sure, but the richer you are the more superfluous costs you have. A poor person spends most of its income in important things, a rich person spends most of its income in superfluous things. That's why I wrote the above!"
"If your purpose is to get as much money as possible then sure. But to me it's about getting round and feeling rich while doing so. And for that you should always focus on what you're spending money on, not on how much you make."
Why not both? Sometimes you'll have it easier to make more money and sometimes you'll have it easier to cut down expenses.
"You don't really know what it's like being poor, do you?"
"Of course not. My general idea is that most poor people spend very little in luxuries (as opposed to the stereotype of poor people and booze), so cutting down expenses isn't a bad idea (e.g finding out where to buy the cheapest groceries, figuring out the best public transportation combo to save money, living in a shared house, etc.), but overall they'll do even better if they try to prepare to get better jobs (e.g saving money to take cheap courses as to get jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, learning interviewing and other job-finding skills, etc.)."
Your a genius
"Late to the party but I couldn't resist.  I was going through a very rough time accepting my body type when I was 15. I worked out heavily, ran as much as I could, ate the healthiest that my part-time job could afford. I was always a little bit bigger than a lot of the girls my age and I was always extremely self conscious, especially in gym class, when I would see these tall, thin, self-confident gazelle-like girls and I was stuck feeling like a short, chubby warthog. One day, I told my best friend about my frustrations regarding being unable to reach my desired body type no matter how hard I tried.  She gave me a tight hug and told me: ""Being thin doesn't mean you're in shape.""  It was damn near almost instantly that my state of mind changed and I became much more confident regarding my body shape ever since. Minimal, I know. It's crazy how one sentence can help you grow so much as an individual."
Thanks for sharing. That's the kind of friend one should have. Have a happy life ahead.
"By the same token, teaching your six year old about the wildly different money-and-status-oriented adult world of manners and social situations in great detail is probably going to leave them fucking autistic."
"To a less experienced me, 'If you're not that experienced with sex, shag her as hard as you can. Because you may not be the best she's ever had, but you'll certainly be the hardest!'"
Yeah but here in America we speak English. If u know another language go to the country that speaks it
This is definitely my favorite one in this thread. Made me smile :)
"IMHO random encounters / talks with people you'll likely never meet again are those that give you the most. I've had my few share of those with people I randomly started talking to while being in Philadelphia for a day waiting for my connecting flight, while in an airplane or while driving on a train in a foreign country. Those are conversations you'll likely never forget and are also a chance to really share something with someone and get something in return."
"Along the same lines. I get upset by other people that drive around stupidly, slow or whatever. I've tried to calm down and I watch more closely on how I drive. I've noticed that I do a lot of things I get upset about. Obviously not often and most of the time it is just due to some external (justified) reason.   The quintessence is that you only ever see most people at one small point in their life. You have no idea whether they had a bad day at work or just previously lost someone close to them or whether they are tired. And most likely you have been driving in a similar state at least once as well.   Nobody is perfect and everybody has bad days. And making your day bad because of that is senseless."
Thank you. I really wanted to post this but didn't find it anymore. I remember reading the OP of this and how it started the sub /r/Ulyssesbucketlist   I've taken this up as well.

Fuck you if you commented sooner this might have actually added to the conversation

I would but I can only see things at the speed of light. What's your excuse?
laziness
"Yep. I say some variation of this phrase if a person's problem comes up in conversation:  ""Tell me what you trust me with,"" or, ""if you're comfortable discussing it with me, you're welcome to.""  None of this ""you can trust me"" garbage. People need to decide for themselves who to trust, on their terms."

":C  I'm a child of immigrant parents, and when I heard someone say this, that's when I realized that NO ONE really understood how smart my mom actually is.   She gave up her career (to become a civil engineer) in her home country to move here for my dad's career. She became a stay-at-home mom. My whole life, I grew up being told that I was smart ""like my dad"". I didn't even KNOW my mom was going to be an engineer until I was in my teens. And even then, even realizing how smart she was THEN, still didn't bring me to realize THIS, the language barrier.  I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she sat through parent-teacher conferences, through conversations with me, with people in this country...her English is not as good as my dad's, because HE has worked here since the 80s, but not my mom.   :'( But she's smart too, y'know?  As a result I'm very protective of her in social situations, but god if I could get those years back...  I'm so protective of her"
"&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  I don't know what your opinion is on talking to yourself in the mirror...  but I recently had to do an important presentation for work. And I am like you; I remember the exact moment back in high school when I realized my friends liked me for ME and it still makes me tear up (even if I still don't understand or believe it).  Anyway, I had to present and for the first time ever, I practiced in front of a mirror AND recorded myself on my phone. I'd already had a rough script in place, but it was not concise or focused. By the time I started practicing, I'd already dismissed it as ""stupid"" but had no choice but to start it.  30 seconds in it was like starting at a stranger in the mirror! Who was this articulate girl who sounded like she knew what she was talking about? WHO WAS SHE AND CAN SHE STAY?!? That was when I realized that, oh, okay, this is why people think I'm smart. The words I'm saying have meaning. And then hearing it recorded back was just as eye-opening. Where I once thought I was being vague (b/c there were details in my head that I didn't have time for), I instead sounded concise and confident. It was so fucking weird.  It might sound a little foolish, but try it. Try 'presenting' in front of a mirror and record yourself. Talk about something you really know. Even if it's about yourself! And watch yourself. That's what the world sees. You are well worth the effort, the respect, and the love. &lt;3"

Thanks for the share. Glad people are still answering and sharing even after this long.
"Late to the party.  I got a similar story. I had to choose a 'family' name in my college organization. We always had a semester-ly BBQ and a couple of us would always dart to the playground. Because why not? Then it hit me, the family should be called Mission Playground!  Much like OP said, a metaphor for the playground is your happy place-- Mission: Playground.   Later the BBQ was moved to a different park that had to playground :(  Another side fun fact. There is a Mission Street near campus and it was a main road. We'd always go to a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop on it. Others who weren't in the family made a connection that ""Mission Street was our playground"". I didn't even think of that."
